AB  - The synthesis of L-galactosylceramide is described. Data are presented indicating
      that this enantiomorph of D-galactocerebroside is not cleaved by
      galactocerebroside-beta-galactosidase obtained from mammalian tissues. The
      synthesis of L-glucosylceramide and beta-D-glucothiocerebroside are outlined.
      These compounds are also refractory to catabolism by glycosidases in mammalian
      tissues that catalyze the hydrolysis of naturally occurring cerebrosides.
      L-Hexosyl- and thioanalogs of cerebrosides and perhaps psychosines as well may be
      helpful for investigating the pathogenesis of Krabbe's disease and Gaucher's
      disease.

PG  - 185-97
AB  - Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II or hereditary erythroblastic
      polynuclearity with positive acidified serum test (HEMPAS) is a rare genetic
      disease inherited by a recessive mode. Previous studies on HEMPAS erythrocytes
      have shown that Band 3 and Band 4.5 glycoproteins were not glycosylated by
      lactosaminoglycans, while polylactosaminyl carbohydrates are accumulated as
      glycolipids (P. Scartezzini et al., Br J. Haematol., 51 (1982) 569; M.N. Fukuda
      et al., Br. J. Haematol., 56 (1984)55). Presently, we have isolated
      polylactosaminyl lipids from HEMPAS blood cells and analyzed their structures by 
      fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), methylation analysis,
      endo-beta-galactosidase digestion. The results indicate that polylactosaminyl
      lipids accumulated in HEMPAS erythrocytes are a species of
      poly-N-acetyllactosaminylceramides which are also present in normal erythrocytes,
      but at 7 approximately 9 times lower level. Isolated polylactosaminylceramides
      exhibit I-, i-, H- and Lex antigenic activities which suggest that the
      polylactosaminylceramides are derived from both erythrocytes and granulocytes.

TI  - Structural analysis of papaya polysaccharide II.
PG  - 173-81
AB  - The structure of papaya polysaccharide II (PP II) isolated by Chandrasekaran et
      al. [Carbohydr. Res., 60 (1978) 105-115] has been investigated by methylation
      analysis of the carboxyl-reduced polymer and by partial hydrolysis of both the
      intact (arabinose, 31.0; rhamnose, 13.3; galactose, 42.6; glucuronic acid, 10.3; 
      and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, 2.8%), and carboxyl-reduced polymers. Methylation 
      analysis of carboxyl-reduced PP II indicated a very highly branched structure in 
      which approximately 39% of the galactopyranose units are disubstituted, 24% are
      monosubstituted, 20% are trisubstituted, and 17% are nonreducing end units.
      Methylation analysis of products of partial hydrolysis of both intact and
      carboxyl-reduced polymers indicated that the backbone of the polysaccharide is
      made up of galactosyl residues substituted at either O-3 or -6, that the
      principal aldobiouronic acid fragment is 6-O-(glucopyranosyluronic
      acid)galactose, that the rhamnosyl units are substituted at O-3 with either
      terminal arabinofuranosyl or galactopyranosyl groups, and that the rhamnosyl
      residues are themselves linked to glucuronic acid residues through O-4. From this
      information, a possible statistical fragment with six arabinofuranose and two
      galactopyranose nonreducing end-groups per 19 sugar units [five units in the main
      chain of (1----3)-linked galactopyranose units] is proposed.

      ranose was investigated as an alternative to the original procedure of Brigl and 
      Gruner (condensation of a D-glucose triol with benzaldehyde under zinc halide
      catalysis) for synthesis of
      3,5-O-benzylidene-1,2-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-glucofuranose. The two routes
      afford opposite benzylidene diastereoisomers: the traditional procedure leads to 
      the thermodynamically favored isomer (phenyl and C-6 trans), whereas the new
      sequence gives the cis compound. The orientations and conformations of these
      isomers were determined after conversion into the corresponding 6-iodides 5 and
      7. X-Ray crystallography revealed that the 1,3-dioxane ring of the trans isomer 7
      exists in the expected chair, "O-inside" conformation. In contrast, a combination
      of n.m.r. spectroscopy and molecular-mechanics calculations demonstrated that the
      same ring of cis diastereomer 5 does not adopt the alternative chair, "H-inside" 
      conformation; instead, it exists in a specific twist form.

      -beta-D-galactopyranosyl]-(1----6)-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D- galactopyranoside, 
      4 (4%) and 5 (88%), respectively. Selective removal of the bromoacetyl group from
      5 gave allyl
      O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1----6)-2,3,4-tri-O-a cet yl-beta
      - D-galactopyranoside (6), which, after condensation with
      2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl bromide (1) yielded both allyl
      O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-alpha- and
      -beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1----6)-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-
      galactopyranosyl)-(1----6)-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, 7 (10%)
      and 8 (70%), respectively. When 6 was condensed with 2, allyl
      O-[2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-6-O-(bromoacetyl)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl]-(1----6 )-O-
      (2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1----6)-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl -beta-D 
      - galactopyranoside (75%) was obtained. This was selectively
      O-de(bromoacetyl)ated to yield the nonaacetate, which was condensed with bromide 
      1 to give allyl O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-alpha- and
      -beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1----6)-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-
      galactopyranosyl)-(1----6)-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl )-
      (1----6)-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, 14 (4%) and 15 (70%).
      Epoxidation of the allyl group of 8 and 15 with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, and
      removal of the acetyl protecting groups with sodium methoxide, gave,
      respectively, 2,3-epoxypropyl
      O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----6)-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----6)-be ta-D-
      galactopyranoside (17) and the corresponding tetrasaccharide 19. Sequential
      acetylation and O-debenzylation of 6-O-benzyl-D-galactose, followed by coupling
      of the product with bromide 1, yielded
      O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1----6)-1,2,3,4-tetr a-O-
      acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranose (12). Conversion of 12 into the bromide by
      treatment with bromotrimethylsilane, and condensation of the product with
      nucleophile 6 also gave the beta-linked tetrasaccharide 15 of this series.
      Epoxidation of the allyl group, followed by removal of acetyl blocking groups in 
      the latter compound, again gave 2,3-epoxypropyl
      O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----6)-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----6)-O- beta-D- 
      galactopyranosyl-(1----6)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (19).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

AB  - Analysis of the glycosphingolipid composition in one case of uterine
      leiomyosarcoma metastasized to the liver showed an accumulation of
      globotriaosylceramide as compared with normal liver and uterus from which the
      tumour originated. The structure and the amount of glycosphingolipids were
      established by using specific glycosidases, permethylation analysis and h.p.l.c. 
      The reason for the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in leiomyosarcoma
      remains to be answered.

TI  - A triple-binding-domain model explains the specificity of the interaction of a
      sphingolipid activator protein (SAP-1) with sulphatide, GM1-ganglioside and
      globotriaosylceramide.
PG  - 921-4
AB  - The conformations of the neutral glycosphingolipid, globotriaosylceramide, and of
      the methyl ester of GM1-ganglioside have been predicted by energy-minimization
      techniques and compared with those previously obtained for GM1- and
      GM2-ganglioside. A triple-binding-domain model is put forward to explain known
      specificities of binding between these glycosphingolipids and activator proteins.
      This model suggests that hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions and
      hydrogen-bonding between sugar residues are important. The model is discussed in 
      relation to previous studies on the effect of chemical modification of
      glycosphingolipids on their ligand properties.

TI  - Micro-injection of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate activates sea urchin eggs
      by a mechanism dependent on external Ca2+.
PG  - 917-20
AB  - Micro-injection of submicromolar concentrations of inositol
      1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate caused a raising of the fertilization envelope in eggs 
      of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. This effect was dependent both on the
      presence of extracellular Ca2+ and on co-injection with a Ca2+-mobilizing
      compound, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was
      the most potent compound tested in this assay; removal of the 3- or 5-phosphates 
      or randomization of the phosphates in the inositol ring decreased its potency.
      These results show that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate is an intracellular
      second messenger, and suggest that its function is to control cellular Ca2+
      homoeostasis at the plasma membrane.

TI  - Valine metabolism. Gluconeogenesis from 3-hydroxyisobutyrate.
PG  - 909-12
AB  - During valine catabolism in muscle both 2-oxoisovalerate and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate
      can be released into the circulation. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate is a good
      gluconeogenic substrate in isolated cortical tubules and hepatocytes. The maximal
      rate of gluconeogenesis from 3-hydroxyisobutyrate was greater than from
      2-oxoisovalerate. We propose that 3-hydroxyisobutyrate is an inter-organ
      metabolite by which the gluconeogenic potential of valine, whose catabolism has
      been initiated in muscle, may be conserved.

AB  - Absolute rate constants for the reaction of NADH with thiyl free radicals derived

      support the possibility that, in biochemical systems, thiols may act as catalysts
      linking hydrogen-atom and electron-transfer reactions.

PG  - 891-5
AB  - Fatty acids with carbon chain lengths greater than 22 (VLCFA) have been detected 
      in boar, ram, bull and human spermatozoa. Saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty
      acids were present in all spermatozoa but, except for human spermatozoa,
      polyenoic fatty acids were quantitatively the most important components. Marked
      differences in polyenoic fatty acid composition were observed. Whereas human
      spermatozoa contain predominantly di-, tri- and tetraenoic fatty acids with up to
      32 carbon atoms, boar, ram and bull spermatozoa also contain pentaenoic and/or
      hexaenoic acids with up to 34 carbon atoms. Human and boar spermatozoa differ
      markedly from those of the ram and bull in that only n-6 series acids are
      present.

PG  - 885-9
AB  - Polyadenylated RNA isolated from NN-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene-induced rat
      hepatoma was used to prepare a cDNA library in lambda gt10. Full-length clones
      complementary to mRNA coding for glutathione transferase subunit 7 were isolated 
      and one of these clones (pGSTr7) was fully characterized. In Northern blot
      analysis, mRNA hybridizing to 32P-labelled pGSTr7 was found in poly(A)-containing
      RNA isolated from seven normal rat tissues but not from testis and liver. A
      similar hybridizing mRNA species was also detected in human placental mRNA. The
      same probe, used in a Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, suggests the
      presence of a multigene family in the rat.

TI  - [3H]dipyridamole binding to nucleoside transporters from guinea-pig and rat lung.
PG  - 879-83
AB  - Membranes from guinea-pig lung exhibited high-affinity binding of
      [3H]dipyridamole, a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport. Binding (apparent
      KD 2 nM) was inhibited by the nucleoside-transport inhibitors
      nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), dilazep and lidoflazine and by the transported
      nucleosides uridine and adenosine. In contrast, there was no detectable
      high-affinity binding of [3H]dipyridamole to lung membranes from the rat, a
      species whose nucleoside transporters exhibit a low sensitivity to dipyridamole
      inhibition. Bmax. values for high-affinity binding of [3H]dipyridamole and
      [3H]NBMPR to guinea-pig membranes were similar, suggesting that these
      structurally unrelated ligands bind to the NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter
      with the same stoichiometry.

TI  - Chromatographic resolution of chicken phosvitin. Multiple macromolecular species 
      in a classic vitellogenin-derived phosphoprotein.
PG  - 871-8
AB  - Chicken phosvitin was prepared from egg yolk by a variety of published methods,
      including a modification of our own original procedure. Yolk granules and all
      phosvitin preparations have been previously found to contain major
      phosphoproteins at Mr 40,000 and 33,000 and minor satellite components when
      electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gradient gels and stained with Stains-all.
      However, only our current preparation contained three additional phosphoproteins 
      (Mr 18,000, 15,000 and 13,000) that are also present in yolk granules. Our
      current phosvitin preparation also appeared to have additional components when
      compared with other preparations by size-exclusion and anion-exchange
      chromatography. Particularly complex but entirely reproducible patterns were
      obtained by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. However, a cross-referencing 
      of fractions eluted by size-exclusion chromatography to the other procedures
      employed, including gel electrophoresis, reinforced the notion that
      unfractionated chicken phosvitin contains at least five major components,
      designated B, C, E1, E2 and F for the Mr 40,000, 33,000, 15,000, 18,000, and
      13,000 phosphoproteins, respectively. Stoichiometric considerations lead us to
      suggest that vitellogenin I gives rise to phosvitins C and F, vitellogenin II
      gives rise to phosvitin B, and vitellogenin III gives rise to either phosvitin E1
      or E2, but not both. Thus, a fourth, as yet undetected, vitellogenin may exist
      for the chicken.

TI  - Histone acetylation in chicken erythrocytes. Estimation of the percentage of
      sites actively modified.
PG  - 857-62
AB  - Within the N-terminal regions of the DNA-bound histone, 26 lysine residues per
      nucleosome may be acetylated and deacetylated. In the present paper the
      percentage of these residues actively acetylated and deacetylated in chicken
      erythrocytes was measured. This percentage is estimated as 3.7% in chicken
      immature, and 2.1% in chicken mature, erythrocytes. In metabolically active,
      dividing, cells one would predict that, after a few generations, each site would 
      at some point in time be modified. We conclude that, in the relatively inactive
      immature chicken erythrocyte, no more than 1-2% of the genome is composed of
      dynamically acetylated and deacetylated histone, this percentage decreasing with 
      cell maturity. The active histone acetylation and deacetylation may be confined
      to transcriptionally active or potentially active erythrocyte domains.

TI  - Human monoclonal antibody recognizing liver-type aldolase B.
PG  - 847-56
AB  - A human hybridoma clone (4E3) has been established by fusing lymphocytes from a
      lymph node taken from a breast cancer patient and human lymphoblastoid cells,
      LICR-LON-HMy2, by the poly(ethylene glycol) method. 4E3 has been stabilized and
      continued to secrete IgMk antibody into culture medium (greater than 10
      micrograms/ml) for over 1 year. The following characteristics of the antigen
      strongly suggested that 4E3 recognizes liver-type aldolase B (EC 4.1.2.13): the
      Mr of the native molecule is 160,000 and that of the subunit is 40,000, and thus 
      it has a tetrameric structure of identical subunits; the antigen is abundant in
      the liver and kidney of human, mouse and rabbit, and is localized by
      immunohistochemical methods in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and in the proximal
      tubules of the kidney; the antigen is precipitable by 50-80% saturation with
      (NH4)2SO4; the antigen shows charge-dependent heterogeneity on DEAE-cellulose
      chromatography. To confirm this notion, aldolase B was purified to homogeneity
      from the liver of human, mouse and rabbit by phosphocellulose chromatography.
      During the chromatographic purification, the antigen activity as assayed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (e.l.i.s.a.) was superimposed on the enzymic
      activity of aldolase. Furthermore, monoclonal antibody 4E3 strongly reacted with 
      purified aldolase B in SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis followed by Western
      blotting and also in e.l.i.s.a. using microplates coated with purified enzyme.
      The reaction between aldolase B and 4E3 activated the human complement system as 
      assessed by the attachment of C3 to the immune complex of aldolase B and 4E3.

TI  - Protein degradation in cat liver cells.
PG  - 843-6
AB  - Body proteins in cats were prelabelled with [14C]valine, and protein degradation 
      was studied in isolated hepatocytes. Amino acids appeared to have a direct
      inhibitory effect on protein degradation, but the effects were generally smaller 
      than those previously shown in the rat. The amino acid control of protein
      degradation in the cat differs from that in the rat, as shown by the lack of
      effects of glutamine, asparagine, arginine or methionine in cat hepatocytes. This
      may be related to the unique features of protein metabolism of this species.
      NH4Cl, leupeptin and amino acids, which suppress lysosomal protein degradation by
      different mechanisms, caused less than 30% inhibition of protein degradation when
      used at the optimum concentrations reported for the rat. The ability of the
      lysosomal system to respond to nutritional deprivation is apparently lower in the
      cat than in the rat.

PG  - 829-36
AB  - Arterial--venous differences for metabolites across liver, kidney and
      hindquarters were measured in fed or starved, artificially ventilated chickens.
      The results indicate that the liver takes up amino acids under both conditions.
      Urate and glucose are released by the liver in both the fed and the starved
      state. Lactate and amino acids are extracted from blood by the kidneys, and this 
      increases in the starved chicken. Urate is removed from the circulation by the
      kidney in the fed and starved state and excreted. In the fed bird there is no
      significant arteriovenous difference of glucose across the kidney, but in the
      starved state the kidney releases glucose into the circulation. The hindquarters 
      take up glucose in the fed but not in the starved state. The branched-chain amino
      acids valine and leucine were taken up by the hindquarters in the fed, but not
      the starved, chicken. Glycerol is released by the hindquarter of fed and starved 
      chickens. In the starved state, alanine and glutamine represent 57% of the amino 
      acids released by the hindquarter. Lactate is released by the hindquarter of
      starved chickens and represents the major gluconeogenic carbon source released by
      the hindquarter and taken up by kidney and liver. Although the liver is the major
      gluconeogenic organ in the starved chicken, the kidney accounts for approx. 30%
      of the glucose produced.

TI  - Inhibition of the low-Km mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase by diethyl maleate 
      and phorone in vivo and in vitro. Implications for formaldehyde metabolism.
PG  - 821-7
AB  - Formaldehyde can be oxidized primarily by two different enzymes, the low-Km
      mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase and the cytosolic GSH-dependent formaldehyde
      dehydrogenase. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of diethyl
      maleate or phorone, agents that deplete GSH from the liver, on the oxidation of
      formaldehyde. The addition of diethyl maleate or phorone to intact mitochondria
      or to disrupted mitochondrial fractions produced inhibition of formaldehyde
      oxidation. The kinetics of inhibition of the low-Km mitochondrial aldehyde
      dehydrogenase were mixed. Mitochondria isolated from rats treated in vivo with
      diethyl maleate or phorone had a decreased capacity to oxidize either
      formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. The activity of the low-Km, but not the high-Km,
      mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase was also inhibited. The production of CO2
      plus formate from 0.2 mM-[14C]formaldehyde by isolated hepatocytes was only
      slightly inhibited (15-30%) by incubation with diethyl maleate or addition of
      cyanamide, suggesting oxidation primarily via formaldehyde dehydrogenase.
      However, the production of CO2 plus formate was increased 2.5-fold when the
      concentration of [14C]formaldehyde was raised to 1 mM. This increase in product
      formation at higher formaldehyde concentrations was much more sensitive to
      inhibition by diethyl maleate or cyanamide, suggesting an important contribution 
      by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. Thus diethyl maleate and phorone,
      besides depleting GSH, can also serve as effective inhibitors in vivo or in vitro
      of the low-Km mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. Inhibition of formaldehyde
      oxidation by these agents could be due to impairment of both enzyme systems known
      to be capable of oxidizing formaldehyde. It would appear that a critical amount
      of GSH, e.g. 90%, must be depleted before the activity of formaldehyde
      dehydrogenase becomes impaired.

      reactions of the enzyme-substrate system.

TI  - The structures and proteolytic specificities of autolysed human thrombin.
PG  - 797-802
AB  - Three Arg/Lys-Xaa bonds in the B-chain of human alpha-thrombin were found to be
      the major autolytic sites. Under the conditions of 1 mg of alpha-thrombin/ml in
      50 mM-ammonium bicarbonate solution at 25 degrees C, the 50% cleavage times of
      Lys-Gly (residues 154-155), Arg-Tyr (residues 70-71) and Arg-Asn (residues 73-74)
      were 32 h, 72 h and 96 h respectively. Fragments generated from these three major
      autolytic sites were purified and analysed. In addition, minor and random
      autolytic cleavages occurred simultaneously that eventually led to the complete
      breakdown of the enzyme. These results reveal several novel aspects about the
      process of autolysis and the structure of autolysed human thrombin. It identifies
      a major autolytic site at Arg-Tyr (residues 70-71) that has not been previously
      reported. It demonstrates that beta-thrombin is not an obligatory intermediate
      during the process of conversion of alpha-thrombin into gamma-thrombin. There
      exists a new form of autolysed thrombin, designated as beta'-thrombin (with
      cleavage at Lys-Gly only), which also serves as the intermediate in the
      conversion of alpha-thrombin into gamma-thrombin. It shows that autolysis of
      human alpha-thrombin does not proceed in an absolutely clear-cut manner. Numerous
      minor cleavages, which amount to approx. 20% of the three major autolytic sites, 
      occur simultaneously. It is the first time that several autolytic sites of human 
      alpha-thrombin have been quantitatively analysed, and that it has been shown that
      formation of beta-, beta'- and gamma-thrombins can be quantitatively followed by 
      the h.p.l.c. method. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that alpha-thrombin and
      the autolysed thrombin (mixture of beta-, beta'- and gamma-thrombins) have
      comparable proteolytic activity and specificity towards various sizes of
      non-fibrinogen polypeptide substrates with relative molecular masses ranging from
      3000 to 25,000.

TI  - Metabolic effects of D-glyceraldehyde in isolated hepatocytes.
PG  - 771-6
AB  - The effects of D-glyceraldehyde on the hepatocyte contents of various metabolites
      were examined and compared with the effects of fructose, glycerol and
      dihydroxyacetone, which all enter the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathways at the
      triose phosphate level. D-Glyceraldehyde (10 MM) caused a substantial depletion
      of hepatocyte ATP, as did equimolar concentrations of fructose and glycerol.
      D-Glyceraldehyde and fructose each caused a 2-fold increase in fructose
      1,6-bisphosphate and the accumulation of millimolar quantities of fructose
      1-phosphate in the cells. D-Glyceraldehyde caused an increase in the glycerol
      3-phosphate content and a decrease in the dihydroxyacetone phosphate content,
      whereas dihydroxyacetone increased the content of both metabolites. The increase 
      in the [glycerol 3-phosphate]/[dihydroxyacetone phosphate] ratio caused by
      D-glyceraldehyde was not accompanied by a change in the cytoplasmic [NAD+]/[NADH]
      ratio, as indicated by the unchanged [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio. The accumulation
      of fructose 1-phosphate from D-glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in
      the hepatocyte can account for the depletion of the intracellular content of the 
      latter. Presumably ATP is depleted as the result of the accumulation of
      millimolar amounts of a phosphorylated intermediate, as is the case with fructose
      and glycerol. It is suggested that the accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate
      during hepatic fructose metabolism is the result of a temporary increase in the
      D-glyceraldehyde concentration because of the high rate of fructose
      phosphorylation compared with triokinase activity. The equilibrium constant of
      aldolase favours the formation and thus the accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate.

TI  - Calmodulin-binding proteins and calmodulin-regulated enzymes in dog pancreas.
PG  - 753-63
AB  - Calmodulin was isolated and purified to homogeneity from dog pancreas. Highly
      purified subcellular fractions were prepared from dog pancreas by zonal
      sucrose-density ultracentrifugation and assayed for their ability to bind
      125I-calmodulin in vitro. Proteins contained in these fractions were also
      examined for binding of 125I-calmodulin after their separation by
      polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in SDS. Calmodulin-binding proteins were
      detected in all subcellular fractions except the zymogen granule and
      zymogen-granule membrane fractions. One calmodulin-binding protein (Mr 240,000), 
      observed in a washed smooth-microsomal fraction, has properties similar to those 
      of alpha-fodrin. The postribosomal-supernatant fraction contained three prominent
      calmodulin-binding proteins, with apparent Mr values of 62,000, 50,000 and
      40,000. Calmodulin-binding proteins, prepared from a postmicrosomal-supernatant
      fraction by Ca2+-dependent affinity chromatography on immobilized calmodulin,
      exhibited calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase, protein phosphatase and protein
      kinase activities. In the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, phosphorylation of
      smooth-muscle myosin light chain and brain synapsin and autophosphorylation of a 
      Mr-50,000 protein were observed. Analysis of the protein composition of the
      preparation by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis revealed a major protein of
      Mr 50,000 which bound 125I-calmodulin. This protein shares characteristics with
      the calmodulin-dependent multifunctional protein kinase (kinase II) recently
      observed to have a widespread distribution. The possible role of
      calmodulin-binding proteins and calmodulin-regulated enzymes in the regulation of
      exocrine pancreatic protein synthesis and secretion is discussed.

TI  - Changes in glucose 1,6-bisphosphate content in rat skeletal muscle during
      contraction.
PG  - 747-51
AB  - Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, glycogen, lactate and other 
      glycolytic metabolites were measured in rat gastrocnemius muscle, which was
      electrically stimulated in situ via the sciatic nerve. Both the frequency and the
      duration of stimulation were varied to obtain different rates of glycolysis.
      There was no apparent relationship between fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content and 
      lactate accumulation in contracting muscle. In contrast, glucose 1,6-bisphosphate
      content increased with lactate concentration during contraction. It is suggested 
      that the increase in glucose 1,6-bisphosphate could play a role in
      phosphofructokinase stimulation and in the activation of the glycolytic flux
      during muscle contraction.

PG  - 709-15
AB  - DNA sequences encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit
      precursor from Pisum sativum L. have been transcribed from plasmids containing
      the SP6 promoter, and translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. The small
      subunit precursor polypeptide, its N-terminal leader sequence (transit peptide)
      and the mature small subunit have each been synthesized independently from three 
      different plasmid constructs. The precursor polypeptide is imported into isolated
      pea chloroplasts and processed to the mature small subunit by a stromal
      proteinase. The mature polypeptide is neither imported, nor subject to
      proteolysis by stromal extracts. The transit peptide alone is very rapidly
      degraded by a stromal proteinase activity which can be inhibited by EDTA or
      1,10-phenanthroline. The use of these gene constructs helps to establish the
      crucial role of the transit peptide in protein import into the chloroplast.

TI  - Collagen defects in lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta.
PG  - 699-708
AB  - Quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of collagen were observed in tissues
      and fibroblast cultures from 17 consecutive cases of lethal perinatal
      osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The content of type I collagen was reduced in OI
      dermis and bone and the content of type III collagen was also reduced in the
      dermis. Normal bone contained 99.3% type I and 0.7% type V collagen whereas OI
      bone contained a lower proportion of type I, a greater proportion of type V and a
      significant amount of type III collagen. The type III and V collagens appeared to
      be structurally normal. In contrast, abnormal type I collagen chains, which
      migrated slowly on electrophoresis, were observed in all babies with OI. Cultured
      fibroblasts from five babies produced a mixture of normal and abnormal type I
      collagens; the abnormal collagen was not secreted in two cases and was slowly
      secreted in the others. Fibroblasts from 12 babies produced only abnormal type I 
      collagens and they were also secreted slowly. The slower electrophoretic
      migration of the abnormal chains was due to enzymic overmodification of the
      lysine residues. The distribution of the cyanogen bromide peptides containing the
      overmodified residues was used to localize the underlying structural
      abnormalities to three regions of the type I procollagen chains. These regions
      included the carboxy-propeptide of the pro alpha 1(I)-chain, the helical alpha
      1(I) CB7 peptide and the helical alpha 1(I) CB8 and CB3 peptides. In one baby a
      basic charge mutation was observed in the alpha 1(I) CB7 peptide and in another
      baby a basic charge mutation was observed in the alpha 1(I) CB8 peptide. The
      primary defects in lethal perinatal OI appear to reside in the type I collagen
      chains. Type III and V collagens did not appear to compensate for the deficiency 
      of type I collagen in the tissues.

TI  - Carbohydrate structures of the third component of rat complement. Presence of
      both high-mannose and complex type oligosaccharide chains.
PG  - 691-8
AB  - We investigated the carbohydrate structure of the third component of complement
      (C3) newly synthesized by cultured rat hepatocytes. When the cells were incubated
      with [3H]mannose, [3H]galactose or [3H]glucosamine, these radioactive precursors 
      were incorporated only into the alpha subunit of C3, demonstrating that only the 
      alpha subunit contains oligosaccharide chains. [3H]Mannose-labelled C3 was
      purified from the culture medium by immunoaffinity chromatography.
      Oligosaccharides prepared by Pronase digestion and strong alkaline hydrolysis
      were separated into two fractions by Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography (Fractions I and 
      II). The two fractions were analysed by concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, 
      ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, and Bio-Gel P-4 gel
      filtration before and after sequential exoglycosidase digestions. It was found
      that Fraction I contained two complex type oligosaccharide chains,
      (NeuAc)2(Gal)2(GlcNAc)2(Man)3(GlcNAc)2 and
      (NeuAc)3(Gal)3(GlcNAc)3(Man)3(GlcNAc)2, and Fraction II contained the
      high-mannose type, consisting mainly of (Man)8(GlcNAc)2. Taken together with the 
      carbohydrate composition of rat serum C3, the results suggest that rat C3 has one
      high-mannose type oligosaccharide chain and two complex type chains in the alpha 
      subunit, which is different from the proposal for human C3.

TI  - Altered lipid synthesis in type II pneumonocytes exposed to lung surfactant.
PG  - 679-90
AB  - When type II pneumonocytes were exposed to purified lung surfactant that
      contained 1-palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, radiolabelled
      surfactant was apparently taken up by the cells since it could not be removed by 
      either repeated washing or exchange with non-radiolabelled surfactant, but was
      released when the cells were lysed. After 4 h of exposure to [3H]surfactant, more
      than half of the 3H within cells remained in disaturated phosphatidylcholine.
      Incorporation of [3H]choline, [14C]palmitate and [14C]acetate into
      glycerophospholipids was decreased in type II cells exposed to surfactant and
      this inhibition, like surfactant uptake, was half-maximal when the extracellular 
      concentration of surfactant was approx. 0.1 mumol of lipid P/ml. Inhibition of
      incorporation of radiolabelled precursors by surfactant occurred rapidly and
      reversibly and was not due solely to dilution of the specific radioactivity of
      intracellular precursors. Activity of dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase,
      but not glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, was decreased in type II cells
      exposed to surfactant and this was reflected by a decrease in the 14C/3H ratio of
      total lipids synthesized when cells incubated with [U-14C]glycerol and
      [2-3H]glycerol were exposed to surfactant. Phosphatidylcholine,
      phosphatidylglycerol and cholesterol, either individually or mixed in the molar
      ratio found in surfactant, did not mimic purified surfactant in the inhibition of
      glycerophospholipid synthesis. In contrast, an apoprotein fraction isolated from 
      surfactant inhibited greatly the incorporation of [3H]choline into lipids and
      this inhibitory activity was labile to heat and to trypsin. It is concluded that 
      the apparent uptake of surfactant by type II cells in vitro is accompanied by an 
      inhibition of glycerophospholipid synthesis via a mechanism that involves a
      surfactant apoprotein.

TI  - The relationship between the optical properties and the kinetic behaviour of
      ascorbate-inhibited alkaline phosphatase.
PG  - 667-71
AB  - Aromatic residues of bovine kidney alkaline phosphatase appear to be involved in 
      the interaction with ascorbate, as shown by the strong quenching of intrinsic
      fluorescence and absorption. Difference u.v.-absorption spectra clearly indicate 
      that conformational changes also occur. The pH value at which the greatest
      fluorescence deactivation is found is close to that necessary for optimal
      catalytic activity and for maximal inhibition by ascorbate. A protective effect
      against ascorbate is afforded by Pi. Time profiles of inactivation on one side
      and of absorbance and emission quenching on the other display opposite
      behaviours. Attempts to reverse the effects by the use of KOH fail to restore
      enzyme activity or to modify the spectral effects of ascorbate. The protein
      alterations are related, directly or indirectly, to the enzyme active centre and 
      can be probably ascribed to the redox and chelating properties of ascorbate.

TI  - Bryodin, a ribosome-inactivating protein from the roots of Bryonia dioica L.
      (white bryony).
PG  - 659-65
AB  - Bryodin is a strongly basic (pI greater than or equal to 9.5) glycoprotein
      (neutral sugar content 6.3%) with Mr 30,000, purified from the roots of Bryonia
      dioica (white bryony). This protein inhibits protein synthesis by a rabbit
      reticulocyte lysate with and ID50 (concentration causing 50% inhibition) of 0.12 
      nM (3.6 ng/ml) and has much less effect on protein synthesis by whole cells, with
      ID50 values ranging from 46 nM to 2.27 microM (1.4-67 micrograms/ml). Bryodin
      acts by inactivating ribosomes, with a less-than-equimolar ratio, which suggests 
      a catalytic action. Bryodin decreases the number of local lesions induced by
      tobacco mosaic virus in the leaves of Nicotiana glutinosa. From all its
      properties, bryodin can be considered to be a ribosome-inactivating protein,
      similar to those already known [reviews: Barbieri & Stirpe (1982) Cancer Surveys 
      1, 489-520; Stirpe & Barbieri (1986) FEBS Lett. 195, 1-8].

TI  - Location of antithrombin-binding regions in rat skin heparin proteoglycans.
PG  - 625-32
AB  - Rat skin heparin proteoglycan labelled biosynthetically with 35S was fractionated
      on a column of antithrombin-Sepharose into fractions with varying degrees of
      affinity for antithrombin. These were treated with NaOH to release heparin chains
      (Mr 60,000-100,000), by beta-elimination or incubated with serum to produce
      fragments of the same order of size as commercial heparin (Mr 5000-30,000), by
      endoglycosidase cleavage. Chains and fragments were then fractionated on
      antithrombin-Sepharose. The various fractions were deaminated with HNO2 at pH 1.5
      followed by reduction with NaB3H4. Approx 90% of the incorporated 3H was
      associated with disaccharides. These were fractionated by high-performance
      ion-exchange chromatography. A unique minor component corresponding to the
      sequence glucuronosyl-N-sulphoglucosaminyl (3,6-di-O-sulphate) in the
      polysaccharide was found only in fractions with high affinity for antithrombin.
      The glucosamine residue linked to C-4 of this glucuronosyl unit was predominantly
      (or exclusively) N-sulphated rather than N-acetylated, pointing to a structural
      difference between the antithrombin-binding region of rat heparin and that of pig
      mucosal heparin. Calculations based on the distribution of the glucosaminyl
      3-O-sulphate group showed that approximately two-thirds of the total
      antithrombin-binding regions present in the unfractionated material were
      accommodated by only 20% of the proteoglycan molecules, and by 10% of the
      polysaccharide chains. While most of the proteoglycan molecules thus lacked such 
      regions (and hence affinity for antithrombin) a minor proportion of the
      polysaccharide chains contained on the average three binding regions per
      molecule. These findings support by direct chemical analysis an earlier proposal,
      based on anticoagulant activities of similar rat skin heparin fractions, that the
      distribution of antithrombin-binding sites in intact heparin proteoglycans is
      markedly non-random.

PG  - 1767-77
AB  - It is generally accepted that cell mediated immunity is impaired in melanoma
      patients. Several studies, however, could not confirm this thesis, especially in 
      early malignancy. Therefore, it was the aim of our study to evaluate the results 
      of the DNCB skin tests in melanoma patients of the literature. DNCB sensitization
      lineally decreased with increasing tumor progression. The difference of the
      sensitization rates between controls and stage I patients and between melanoma
      stage I and stage II was significant (p less than 0.001). The difference between 
      stage II patients and stage III melanoma was apparent; statistical analysis,
      however, could not be done, because the results of three out of six evaluated
      studies where contradictory. The results confirm the thesis of impaired delayed
      type immunity in the course of tumor progression and support the therapeutic
      approaches of immune modulation in tumor patients: BCG vaccination, DNCB
      sensitization, interferon application.

AB  - Late in August 1985, seventeen subjects in the 3-40 year range contracted
      salmonellosis which was associated with the consumption of fermented pork sausage
      prepared by a butcher. The incubation period varied from 6 to 9 hours, the attack
      rate was a hundred per cent; there were no deaths or complications. The pH of the
      incriminated sausage was 5.7 (the pH of controls ranged from 4.5 to 5.0), and the
      aw was 0.99 (vs. 0.92-0.97 in the controls), a colony count of thermotrophic
      Enterobacteriaceae was 10(7) per 1 g, including c. 10(6) of Salmonella
      typhimurium, c. 10(3) Staphylococcus aureus and c. 10(4) cfu of Clostridium
      perfringes per 1 g. These outbreaks may be prevented by ensuring good practices
      during production and distribution, supported by monitoring line samples by
      determining the pH and aw and cfu assessment of Staphylococcus aureus and
      thermotrophic Enterobacteriaceae.

AB  - In order to promote the optimum exercise of the profession, the occupational
      group developed disciplinary standards of its own. To protect itself from
      socially improper procedures, from default and from its consequences, society
      developed standards of civil law. When a veterinarian is insufficiently equipped 
      for adequate treatment of a patient, this patient will be referred to a
      veterinary surgeon who has acquired the necessary accomplishments in the section 
      concerned; high standards of attainment will be imposed on this veterinarian. The
      fact that the referring veterinarian and the one to whom the patient was referred
      each retain their own responsibilities, is illustrated in examples. All this may 
      result in a further improvement in quality of veterinary health care in the
      Netherlands.

AB  - Whenever a young dog (up to ten months of age) is presented showing lameness of
      one of the hind legs, as well as a swelling in the region of the knee without
      perceptible crepitation, it is advisable to take X-rays immediately, rather than 
      to wait. These X-rays severe to verify or rule out injury of the epiphysis.
      Attention is paid to the clinical and radiological features as well as to the
      pathophysiology and surgical treatment of avulsion of the tuberosity of the tibia
      in dogs in the present paper.

TI  - [Examination and treatment of a loose medial coronoid process in dogs].
PG  - 1234-45
AB  - An ununited medial coronoid process (MCP) is the most common developmental
      disturbance in the elbow joint of young dogs of large and medium-sized breeds.
      The clinical and radiological symptoms of ununited medial coronoid processes in
      thirty-nine dogs are reported, the presence of an ununited medial coronoid
      process being established by arthrotomy in these cases. Lameness was observed for
      the first time in these dogs, mainly Rottweilers, Retrievers and Berner
      Sennenhunde, and more often male dogs than bitches, when they were from four to
      six months of age. They showed lameness ranging from slight to severe, and the
      leg was frequently held in a position of abduction and outward rotation. The
      elbow joints involved often showed abnormal accumulations of fluid, hyperflexion 
      and/or hyperextension being painful. Osteophytes, only occurring along the
      proximal border of the anconeal process, could be well assessed on the
      mediolateral radiographs. The appearance of the MCP, varying from normal to
      ununited, could best be evaluated in the mediolateral and anteroposterior medial 
      oblique radiographs. These two radiographs were also of value in diagnosing an
      ununited anconeal process which was present at the same time as osteochondrosis
      of the medial condyle of the humerus in two dogs. The clinical symptoms were not 
      associated with radiologically perceptible changes in some cases. Arthrotomy of
      the elbows showed that the entire apex or otherwise one or several fragments of
      the MCP, which are often wedged between the radius and ulna in these cases, may
      break off. Rapid post-operative improvement of locomotion is frequently reported.
      Preventive and diagnostic procedures carried out to make possible early
      institution of surgical treatment are discussed.

AB  - Interactions between B-DNA and homopolymeric alpha-helices of glycine, alanine,
      serine, asparagine and aspartic acid have been studied theoretically. The
      complexation energy has been minimised taking into account the interactions
      between DNA and the polypeptides as well as the internal energy of the
      alpha-helix and the interaction energy of counterions with the complex. The
      results obtained indicate the important role of strong hydrogen bonds between the
      peptide side chains and nucleic acid phosphate groups, these bonds being much
      stronger than specific interactions with the base-pairs. The formation of these
      structural bonds depends on the size of the alpha-helix, which in turn determines
      whether bridging across the major groove is possible. The steric role of the
      methyl group of thymine in orienting the peptide helix and the role of DNA
      screening cations in complex stabilization are also significant.

      Two modes of perturbation by which the anesthetics may induce vesicle permeation

AB  - As applications of the general theoretical framework of charge transport in
      biological membranes and related voltage and current noise, a number of model
      calculations are presented for ion carriers, rigid channels, channels with

      special reference to the problem of threshold values for sensory transduction
      processes and their limitations by voltage fluctuations. Furthermore, starting
      from the special results of model calculations, an attempt is made to determine
      more general aspects of electric fluctuations generated by charge-transport
      processes in biological membranes: different frequency dependences of voltage and
      current noise, and dependence of noise intensities with increasing distance from 
      the equilibrium state.

TI  - Nonequilibrium voltage fluctuations in biological membranes. I. General framework
      of charge transport in discrete systems and related voltage noise.
PG  - 135-45
AB  - This paper continues our work on the theory of nonequilibrium voltage noise
      generated by electric transport processes in membranes. Introducing the membrane 
      voltage as a further variable, a system of kinetic equations linearized in
      voltage is derived by which generally the time-dependent behaviour of
      charge-transport processes under varying voltage can be discussed. Using these
      equations, the treatment of voltage noise can be based on the usual master
      equation approach to steady-state fluctuations of scalar quantities. Thus, a
      general theoretical approach to nonequilibrium voltage noise is presented,
      completing our approach to current fluctuations which had been developed some
      years ago. It is explicitly shown that at equilibrium the approach yields
      agreement with the Nyquist relation, while at nonequilibrium this relation is not
      valid. A further general property of voltage noise is the reduction of
      low-frequency noise with increasing number of transport units as a consequence of
      the interactions via the electric field. In a second paper, the approach will be 
      applied for a number of special transport mechanisms, such as ionic channels,
      carriers or electrogenic pumps.

      this type (Glu- 9-His+ 12) was postulated previously to stabilize, to a great
      extent, the alpha-helical conformation of isolated N-terminal fragments of RNase 
      A: C-peptide and S-peptide (A. Bierzynski, P.S. Kim and R.L. Baldwin, Proc. Natl.
      Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79 (1982) 2470). Although in both PA and PF salt bridges
      between glutamates and histidines are formed, as demonstrated by the pH-titration
      curves of the glutamate gamma-proton signals, no traces of helical conformation
      have been detected. Evidently, the Glu- (i)-His+ (i + 3) salt bridges do not
      stabilize the alpha-helical conformation. A comparative analysis of PA and PF NMR
      spectra provides strong evidence that the phenylalanyl ring in PF interacts not
      only with the hydrophobic methyl groups of almost all alanine residues but also
      with the histidine rings and the glutamate side chains in their protonated as
      well as deprotonated forms. Similar interactions, involving Phe 8, can be
      expected in the N-terminal fragments of RNase and should be taken into account as
      an important factor determining the conformational properties of C- and
      S-peptides.

TI  - [Epidemiology of vascular diseases in Italy].
PG  - 2243-54
AB  - The mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases was analysed for Italy as a whole
      and for individual regions in a sample year (1975). A distinction was made
      between cardiac and vascular diseases in order to assess the real incidence of
      the latter. The absolute number of deaths, the percentage mortality and the
      specific mortality quotient were studied. Deaths were also divided into age
      groups. Cardiovascular diseases were found to be the primary cause of death,
      circulatory disease the second. Among the latter, diseases of the encephalic
      circulation took first place. The same parameters were applied to the 1965-1983
      period. Mortality due to cardiovascular disease remained constant over the period
      since the decrease in deaths from cardiac conditions was offset by an increase in
      those due to vascular disease in the strict sense. Finally the specific
      standardised mortality quotients per age and sex were considered in the 1970-1979
      period. Mortality trends in Italy and in the individual regions were identical to
      those described using non-standardised indices.

TI  - [Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome].
PG  - 2201-4
AB  - Trapped popliteal artery syndrome is relatively uncommon: the literature reports 
      some 60 cases. The clinical picture is linked to compression of the popliteal
      artery by the gastrocnemius as it contracts, thus distorting the arterial route. 
      The result is an interruption in the blood flow distally to the area involved due
      to stenosis of the blood vessel that is at first functional but becomes organic.

      tissue isoferritins.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - The ferritins present in the first day human colostrum and mature milk were
      compared with serum and tissue ferritins on the basis of their iron content,
      immunological reactivity and glycosylation. Both had a low iron content. The
      degree of glycosylation and immunochemical properties of colostrum ferritin
      showed strong similarities with serum ferritin. The isoelectric points and
      immunochemical properties of milk ferritin were similar to heart ferritin. The
      concentration of colostrum ferritin was more significantly correlated to body
      iron stores than milk ferritin.

TI  - Methylmalonic aciduria and propionic acidaemia studied by proton nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy.
PG  - 173-89
AB  - Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to monitor changes
      in urinary metabolites in a patient with propionic acidaemia over a period of 10 
      months and in a patient with methylmalonic aciduria over a period of 11 days.
      Results could be obtained within 5-10 min of sample receipt. In the spectra on
      the patient with propionic acidaemia not only could fluctuations in
      3-hydroxypropionate and propionylglycine excretion be followed, but also
      variations in creatine, glycine and betaine, which were often present at
      millimolar concentrations. The patient with methylmalonic aciduria had an acute
      episode of severe ketoacidosis during which the glycine excretion fell but
      creatine excretion rose and then fell on recovery from the episode. The changes
      in the creatine excretion may reflect disorders in intracellular energy supply.
      Nuclear magnetic resonance is a powerful technique for monitoring metabolic
      perturbations in the organic acidurias in 'real-time', allowing the planning and 
      evaluation of therapy.

TI  - Epoxydicarboxylic aciduria resulting from the ingestion of castor oil.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - A woman who was investigated because of suspected malabsorption was found to
      excrete large amounts of 3,6-epoxyoctanedioic, 3,6-epoxydecanedioic and
      3,6-epoxydodecanedioic acids. The origin of these compounds could be traced to
      the factitious ingestion of castor oil. Healthy subjects and conventional as well
      as germ-free rats also excrete these substances after ingestion of castor oil.
      The epoxydicarboxylic acids are thus endogenous metabolites from ricinoleic acid.
      The shortest of the three homologues is present in small amounts in normal urine.
      It may be formed by cyclization of a hydroxylated beta-oxidation intermediate.

AB  - Solubilization of the thyroid particulate-associated NADPH-dependent H2O2
      generating system has been tested with different detergents;

      be the best of the six detergents tested. The ratio of H2O2 generation to NADPH
      oxidation was similar for CHAPS extract and native particulate material. CHAPS
      was also the only detergent able to preserve the Ca++-sensitivity of the NADPH
      oxidase. Solubilization of this enzyme allowed the determination of some of its
      characteristics: specificity for divalent cations, apparent Km for NADPH, optimum
      pH and sensitivity to SH- reagents.

TI  - Catabolism of pentachlorophenol by a Flavobacterium sp.
PG  - 825-30
AB  - The pathway employed for pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation by an aerobic,
      chlorophenol-utilizing Flavobacterium sp. was initiated by conversion of PCP to
      tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TCH). 18O labelling experiments demonstrated that the
      first dechlorination, where a hydroxyl replaced the chlorine at PCP ring position
      number 4, involved a hydrolytic reaction. Then two reductive dechlorinations of
      TCH followed to yield firstly trichlorohydroquinone (TrCH) and then
      2,6-dichlorohydroquinone (DCH). Thus, the initial steps in catabolism of PCP by
      the Flavobacterium were: PCP----TCH----TrCH.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-induced alterations in circulating leukocyte populations.
PG  - 818-24
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor is a potent agent possessing diverse biological functions. 
      We investigated the effects of intravenous administration of human recombinant
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on immune cell populations in CBA/J mice. The animals
      developed a significant lymphopenia and neutrophilia both reaching a maximum at 4
      hours post-injection with a trend towards resolution to normal values by 6 hours.
      The lymphopenia was both relative and absolute. Similarly, the neutrophilia was
      both relative and absolute and was due to the presence of both immature and
      mature neutrophils. As the neutrophilia and lymphopenia occurred concomitantly,
      there was no difference at any time point in the total number of peripheral blood
      white cells. Extensive controls were done to rule out LPS contamination in the
      TNF preparation. These data demonstrate the potent effects of intravenous
      administration of human recombinant tumor necrosis factor on peripheral blood
      constituents.

      and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY).
PG  - 769-73
AB  - Calcium-activated phospholipid dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C)
      activity in platelets was measured in 4, 12, and 20-week-old SHR and WKY. At age 
      4-weeks, there was no significant difference in protein kinase C activity and
      systolic blood pressure between SHR and WKY. In 12 and 20-week-old SHR, both
      protein kinase C activity and systolic blood pressure were significantly higher
      than in the age-matched WKY. These results suggest that protein kinase C may be
      involved in the control of blood pressure in SHR and WKY.

PG  - 756-61
AB  - Coat proteins from the spores of Bacillus sphaericus 1593 were separated by
      preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Neutralising antibodies were
      raised against a single protein band exhibiting toxicity to mosquito larvae. IgG 
      was purified and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B to be used as an
      immunoaffinity matrix. The larvicidal protein was purified to electrophoretic
      homogeneity using this immunoaffinity column. The single protein species resolved
      into four peptides of molecular weights 42.6, 44.1, 50.7 and 51.3 KDa on
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. This protein
      contained 12% carbohydrates. The purified protein exhibited an LC50 value of 8.3 
      +/- 1.6 ng/ml when tested against early third instar larvae of the mosquito Culex
      pipiens var quinquefasciatus.

PG  - 749-55
AB  - Comparison of the temperature dependence of elastomer length of the cross-linked 
      protein, elastin, and of gamma-irradiation cross-linked poly(VPGVG), the
      polypentapeptide of elastin, with that of latex rubber demonstrate markedly
      dissimilar behaviors between a classical rubber and the protein and polypeptide
      elastomers. In the absence of a load latex rubber expands with increasing
      temperature as is known for classical rubbers comprised of a network of random
      chains whereas the protein and polypeptide elastomers markedly decrease in
      length. When under load with a constant applied force, as a classical rubber,
      latex linearly decreases length with increasing temperature whereas the decrease 
      in length is very non-linear with temperature increase for the protein and
      polypeptide elastomers. The protein and polypeptide elastomers examined here do
      not exhibit the characteristic and fundamental temperature dependence of length
      considered typical of networks of random chains. Accordingly the more complex and
      even inverse behavior of elastin and the polypentapeptide of elastin in the
      absence of load require consideration of structural perspectives different from
      those of a random chain network with negligible interchain interactions.

TI  - Two K-regions of 5-methylchrysene are sites of oxidative metabolism.
PG  - 734-40
AB  - Two K-region trans-dihydrodiols were identified as products formed in the
      metabolism of 5-methylchrysene by liver microsomes from phenobarbital-treated
      male Sprague-Dawley rats. These two dihydrodiols were isolated from a mixture of 
      metabolites by reversed-phase and normal-phase high-performance liquid
      chromatographies. Both K-region dihydrodiols were characterized by ultra-violet, 
      mass, and circular dichroism spectral analyses. Chiral stationary phase
      high-performance liquid chromatographic analyses indicated that 5-methylchrysene 
      5,6-dihydrodiol and 11,12-dihydrodiol contain (S,S): (R,R) enantiomer ratios of
      2:98 and 12:88, respectively. Although it is a bay-region dihydrodiol, the
      hydroxyl groups of 5-methylchrysene trans-5,6-dihydrodiol adopt a
      quasidiequatorial conformation.

TI  - Evidence that rabbit cytochrome P-450 K is encoded by the plasmid pP-450 PBc2.
PG  - 728-33
AB  - The complete coding sequence for P-450 PBc2 was inserted into a T7-phage promoter
      system, and a capped cRNA was generated using T7 RNA polymerase. The P-450 PBc2
      cRNA was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The in vitro translation
      product was indirectly immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal antibodies 2F5 and
      3C3 that recognize P-450 K. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that 
      the translated protein product exhibits the same relative electrophoretic
      mobility as P-450 K. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be
      MDLVVVLGL-LS-LLLLSL- for P-450 K immunopurified from rabbit kidney using the
      monoclonal antibody 2F5. This sequence agrees with the predicted amino acid
      sequence derived from the P-450 PBc2 cDNA. These results indicate that P-450 K or
      a protein closely related to P-450 K is encoded by the plasmid pP-450 PBc2.

TI  - 1,2-Dibromoethane causes rat hepatic DNA damage at low doses.
PG  - 723-7
AB  - Two oral doses of 1,2-dibromoethane (10-300 mumol/kg) were given to adult female 
      rats 21 and 4 hours before sacrifice. Then hepatic DNA damage, ornithine
      decarboxylase, cytochrome P-450 content, glutathione content and serum alanine
      aminotransferase activity assays were performed. In addition, DNA damage was
      assessed in blood, bone marrow, kidney, spleen and thymus. Of the six organs
      studied, liver showed the largest amount of DNA damage. Doses at or above 10
      mumol/kg EDB caused DNA damage as determined by the alkaline elution technique.
      Far greater doses (300 mumol/kg, 56.4 mg/kg) of EDB were required to cause other 
      biochemical effects, such as increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase. Thus,
      the carcinogen EDB caused substantial DNA damage at doses far below those
      required to show other biochemical effects or frank liver toxicity. DNA damage
      occurred at a dose level 40-fold lower than that demonstrated in previous
      studies.

PG  - 718-22
AB  - N-Chlorosulfonyl dicyclohexylamine (CSD) was synthesized as a potent inhibitor of

      The compound specifically inhibited spermidine synthase in a competitive mode
      with the substrate putrescine (Ki, 1.8 X 10(-7) M). When human leukemia Molt4B
      cells were cultured in the presence of the inhibitor, the intracellular level of 
      spermidine and the rate of cell proliferation were markedly depressed. In these
      polyamine depleted and growth retarded cells the synthesis of protein, but not of
      DNA or RNA, was found to be significantly diminished.

AB  - The major form of cytochrome P-450, P-450K-5, was purified from kidney microsomes
      of untreated male rats with high-performance liquid chromatography with
      anion-exchange and hydroxylapatite columns. The monomeric molecular weight of
      P-450K-5 was 52000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the CO-reduced
      absorption maximum was at 452 nm. P-450K-5 catalyzed the omega- and
      (omega-1)-hydroxylation of lauric acid, but was inefficient in the
      N-demethylation of benzphetamine and the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycoumarine. The
      NH2-terminal sequence of P-450K-5 was quite different from cytochrome P-450s
      purified from rat hepatic microsomes.

TI  - Primary action of Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin on HeLa and Vero
      cells in the absence of extracellular calcium: rapid and characteristic changes
      in membrane permeability.
PG  - 704-10
AB  - Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin bound rapidly to HeLa and Vero cells
      in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ at 37 degrees C. The bound toxin rapidly
      (within 2 min) caused influx of Na+ and efflux of K+ and Mg2+. Changes in
      membrane permeability occurred in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+
      and to the similar extents at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C, in contrast to the
      subsequent bleb and balloon formation, which required both extracellular Ca2+ and
      incubation at 37 degrees C. Substances with molecular weights of over ca. 200
      protected the cells from the morphological alterations induced by the toxin,
      whereas substances with molecular weights of less than ca. 200 did not. The
      mechanism of the primary action of the enterotoxin is discussed.

      bearing between one and four positive charges with DNA.
PG  - 643-9
AB  - Meso-substituted porphyrins, ((4-N-methyl-pyridyl)n(Ph)4-n)PH2, n = 1 to 4,
      bearing between 1 and 4 positive charges have been synthetized and studied for
      their interaction with Calf Thymus DNA. Competition binding experiments using
      ethidium bromide or one of its dimers show that these porphyrins and some of
      their Cu(II) or Fe(III)Cl complexes have apparent binding constants between 3
      10(5) and 5 10(7) M-1. Fluorescence energy transfer experiments show that not
      only the tetracationic previously described porphyrin but also the tri- and
      dicationic porphyrins are able to intercalate into DNA. These data indicate a
      greater importance of the polyaromatic porphyrin ring than of the number or
      position of the positive charges for meso-tetra-arylporphyrin interaction with
      DNA.

AB  - Protein kinase C (C-kinase) is shown to be present in the cytosolic and
      particulate fractions of mineral oil induced peritoneal macrophages of guinea
      pigs. By omission or use of a high concentration of leupeptin, three forms of the
      enzyme were obtained: stimulant/Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent C-kinase, eluted from
      DEAE 52 cellulose at 0.08-0.16 M NaCl; stimulant/Ca2+/phospholipid-independent
      protein kinase M (M-kinase), and Ca2+-inhibited &
      stimulant/phospholipid-dependent form of protein kinase, both eluted from DEAE 52
      cellulose at 0.18-0.22 M NaCl. Phorbol ester or 1,2-diacylglycerol were used as
      stimulants. It is suggested that Ca2+-inhibited &
      stimulant/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase represents the in vivo form of
      the M-kinase in intact cells.

TI  - Inhibition of ferredoxin: NADP+ reductase activity by the hexacyanochromate (III)
      ion.
PG  - 578-83
AB  - The small inorganic complex Cr(CN)6(3-) is a clean inhibitor of the ferredoxin:
      NADP+ reductase-catalysed oxidation of reduced spinach ferredoxin by NADP+.
      Independent spectrophotometric measurements show that millimolar additions of
      Cr(CN)6(3-) to mixtures of ferredoxin and ferredoxin NADP+ reductase give a
      marked attenuation of the difference spectrum characteristic of
      ferredoxin-ferredoxin: NADP+ reductase complex formation. Since there is no
      evidence, from NMR studies, for significant binding of Cr(CN)6(3-) to ferredoxin,
      these results indicate that Cr(CN)6(3-) binds to ferredoxin: NADP+ reductase at a
      site which is crucial to its interaction with the electron-transfer protein. The 
      effective kinetic binding constant for Cr(CN)6(3-), measured at low ferredoxin
      concentration, is 445 M-1 (ie Kdiss congruent to 2 mM) at 25 degrees, pH7.5, I = 
      0.10 M. With assumption of a simple electrostatic interaction, an enzyme domain
      with an effective charge of 3+/4+ is proposed.

PG  - 517-23
AB  - The complete primary structure of the activation segment of monomeric
      procarboxypeptidase A from porcine pancreas has been determined by automated and 
      manual Edman-like degradation methods performed on its fragments generated by
      enzymatic cleavage. The polypeptide consists of 94 residues, with a molecular
      mass of 10,768, and presents a high proportion of acidic and hydrophobic residues
      and a proline-rich region in the center of the molecule. Comparison of this
      sequence with the already reported equivalent sequence deduced from rat
      procarboxypeptidase A cDNA reveals a very high degree of homology between the two
      propeptides (up to a 81% of identities), which is even higher in certain large
      zones of the molecule.

TI  - Uptake of thiamin by isolated rat liver mitochondria.
PG  - 466-73
AB  - Investigation is made here of 14C-thiamin uptake by rat liver mitochondria in
      vitro. Following incubation with mitochondria, 14C-thiamin remained in the
      mitochondrial pellet in spite of several washings of the organelles. Accordingly,
      externally added thiamin produced intra/extra-mitochondrial concentration ratios 
      up to 5.4 and 14C-thiamin space/3H2O space ratios higher than one. These ratios
      decreased with increasing vitamin concentrations, thus suggesting the occurrence 
      of saturation characteristics for vitamin uptake into mitochondria. Thiamin was
      proven to enter both intermembrane and matrix spaces, where neither binding to
      intramitochondrial protein nor phosphorylation were found to occur. Moreover
      thiamin uptake inhibition by both metal ions and certain thiamin analogues was
      also found.

TI  - Endothelium dependent vascular relaxation by arginine containing polypeptides.
PG  - 446-51
AB  - The vascular endothelium appears obligatory for the expression of the
      vasodilating property of most polypeptides. A number of polypeptides were studied
      on the rat aortic ring preparation which was pre-contracted with phenylephrine
      and only basic polypeptides containing one or more arginine residues elicited
      relaxation which was endothelium dependent. These peptides included melittin and 
      poly-L-Arg. The basic polypeptide poly-L-Lys also elicited endothelium dependent 
      relaxation, but to a lesser extent than arginine containing polypeptides. Two
      basic polypeptides, apamin and mastoparan do not promote endothelium dependent
      relaxation. The former contains arginine between disulfide bonds and in the
      latter arginine is absent. Basic amino acids and dipeptides which contain
      arginine, and also polyamines did not elicit relaxation even at high
      concentrations (10(-3) M). The relaxation elicited by melittin, poly-L-Arg and
      poly-L-Lys was inhibited by ETYA, NDGA, p-bromophenacyl bromide and not by
      indomethacin. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, also
      abolished the relaxation. We suggest that arginine containing peptides may relax 
      vascular smooth muscle by acting directly on the vascular smooth muscle (eg:
      atriopeptins) and/or or by eliciting release of a relaxing factor(s) from the
      endothelium.

PG  - 35-42
AB  - Nifedipine is known to reduce blood pressure for both short- and long-term
      periods. We have shown that nifedipine can be given safely for a short-term
      period to patients with severe hypertension in an outpatient setting, that its
      efficacy can be retained with long-term follow-up therapy, and that nifedipine is
      safe in the presence of cardiomegaly, acting without precipitating a decrease in 
      ejection fraction when used for short-term blood pressure reduction. The acute
      hypotensive effect of sublingual nifedipine can predict the efficacy of
      subsequent follow-up therapy with oral nifedipine, so that there is a sustained
      long-term hypotensive effect.

TI  - Kinetics and dynamics of nifedipine after oral and sublingual doses.
PG  - 2-5
AB  - Nifedipine is frequently administered by the sublingual route to provide rapid
      onset of intense effect, especially in patients in whom urgent reduction of
      elevated blood pressure is indicated. Previously available data, however, suggest
      that peak levels of nifedipine are higher and occur earlier when the drug is
      administered orally. Results of pharmacodynamic studies show that maximal
      hypotensive effects occur between 30 and 60 minutes after administration by
      either route, but that such effects are often achieved earlier when the drug is
      given orally. Recent work implies that the absorption of nifedipine through the
      buccal mucosa is poor, if it occurs at all, and that the appearance of nifedipine
      in plasma requires delivery of the drug to the stomach for active absorption. The
      small time lag in absorption that may be attributed to the dissolution of the
      nifedipine capsule may be obviated by biting through the capsule and swallowing
      the contents; this bite-and-swallow approach to dosing provides the most rapid
      rise in plasma nifedipine concentrations, and produces peak levels well above
      those achieved with sublingual administration.

      cricket.
PG  - 317-30
AB  - Cricket nymphs (Acheta pennsylvanicus) were treated with the publicly available, 
      commercial forms of 2 generically termed stomach poisons; chlordane and rotenone,
      and the resulting tissue changes were histologically compared against a control
      group. Examination utilized stained and unstained slides of the insect's fat
      body, alimentary tract, and malpighian tubules. The 2 dissimilar operating
      insecticides shared common effects such as the storage of dark bodies in the fat 
      body, and the structural disruption of the caecal lining and the malpighian
      tubules. In addition, a unique effect of chlordane was shown that had not been
      conclusively recorded before. This insecticide demonstrated the striking ability 
      to rapidly penetrate the internal digestive tract cuticle lining of the
      proventricular plates resulting in cellular damages. Concern is expressed about
      chronic exposures to the insecticides, especially chlordane, since it has
      widespread use and long persistence.

AB  - Four types of cells in culture were exposed to lead (Pb) acetate (0.1-1000
      microM): astroglia-enriched, oligodendroglia-enriched, and meningeal fibroblast
      cultures prepared from neonatal rat brains; and human neuroblastoma cultures
      prepared from the SK-N-SH-SY5Y cell line. The viability (trypan blue dye
      exclusion and proliferation) of these cell types after Pb exposure was compared
      in order to identify cellular targets in the central nervous system that were
      directly susceptible to cytotoxicity. Of the 4 cell types tested, only
      oligodendroglia showed marked sensitivity to Pb treatment. However, proliferation
      of the SY5Y cells was temporarily inhibited if the cells were treated 1 day (but 
      not 3 days) after seeding. The potential for thiamin, which is used to treat Pb
      intoxication in cattle, to prevent this effect was tested. Rather than preventing
      this toxic effect, however, thiamin (1 mM) exacerbated that inhibition of
      proliferation. Astroglia and meningeal fibroblasts, which were resistant to Pb
      toxicity, were shown by atomic absorption analysis to take up Pb from the culture
      medium and concentrate it intracellularly to at least 55X the extracellular
      concentration, thus supporting hypotheses that these cells act as Pb sinks in the
      brain.

      1-benzopyran-7-yl]oxy]-N,N-dimethyl-Ethanamine: Chemical Abstracts No.
      59257-24-8), has been investigated in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. These
      compounds were administered orally from Days 6 to 15 of gestation inclusive at
      dose levels of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day for BRL 16644 and 10, 20 and 35 mg/kg/day 
      for BRL 16657. At caesarean section on Day 21 of gestation increased
      post-implantation loss, reduced foetal weights and high incidences of gross
      abnormalities were found with both compounds at their high dose levels. Maternal 
      toxicity was evident at the intermediate and high dose levels but teratogenic
      effects extended to the low dose of each compound where treatment was well
      tolerated by the dams. The maternal effects were thought to be due to the
      dopamine potentiating properties of BRL 16644 and BRL 16657. When pimozide, a
      specific dopamine antagonist, was co-administered with BRL 16657 the maternal
      effects were considerably reduced and, although teratogenicity remained, effects 
      of BRL 16657 on the embryo were extensively modified. This suggests that at least
      certain of the abnormalities were associated with prolonged dopamine
      potentiation. Pimozide alone was not teratogenic.

TI  - Carcinogenicity of sodium dichromate and chromium (VI/III) oxide aerosols inhaled
      by male Wistar rats.
PG  - 219-32
AB  - In inhalation chambers, male Wistar rats of the strain TNO-W74 were continuously 
      exposed to submicron aerosols of sodium dichromate and to a pyrolyzed
      Cr(VI)/Cr(III) (3:2) oxide mixture. The sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7) aerosol had 
      the chromium concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 micrograms/m3, the chromium oxide
      mixture (Cr5O12) had the chromium concentration of 100 micrograms/m3. After 18
      months of inhalation the rats were held under conventional conditions for a
      further year. The experimental groups consisted of 20 rats and the control group 
      of 40 rats. More than 90% of the rats in each group reached 2 years. At the end
      of the study the mortality rates amounted to 35%, 45% and 25% in the 3 sodium
      dichromate aerosol groups, respectively, and 50% in the chromium oxide mixture
      aerosol group, which was not significantly different from that of the controls
      (42.5%), living under the same conditions in filtered fresh air. In all sodium
      dichromate exposed groups significant effects were neither found clinically nor
      from hematology and clinical chemistry compared to the controls. In the chromium 
      oxide mixture group, however, there was a number of significant findings.
      Elevated white and red blood cell counts and serum cholesterol as well as
      decreased serum total immunoglobulin levels at different stages of the study were
      observed together with few local lung effects determined histopathologically in
      this group. We assume that these effects are mainly due to the increased chromium
      lung burden of the rats. At the end of the study the lung chromium retention was 
      about 10 times higher for the rats exposed to chromium oxide versus sodium
      dichromate at an aerosol Cr-concentration of 100 micrograms/m3, while the kidney 
      chromium retention was measured to be nearly equal in both groups. Three primary 
      lung tumors (2 adenomas and 1 adenocarcinoma) and 1 malign tumor of the pharynx
      were found at the highest Cr-concentration (100 micrograms/m3) of the sodium
      dichromate aerosol, 1 primary adenoma of the lung was in the chromium oxide
      mixture group exposed also to a Cr-concentration of 100 micrograms/m3. No primary
      lung tumors were observed in the other experimental and control groups. These
      results indicate a weak carcinogenicity at 100 micrograms/m3 for the rats
      continuously exposed to submicron Na2Cr2O7 and Cr5O12 aerosols. Thus, there may
      be a small carcinogenic risk from occupational relevant chromium air levels.
      However, results have to be confirmed with larger animal populations.

TI  - Effects of primaquine on hepatic microsomal haemoproteins and drug oxidation.
PG  - 205-17
AB  - Administration of the antimalarial agent primaquine to male rats (50 mg/kg i.p.
      daily for 4 days) resulted in a 30% decrease in hepatic microsomal cytochrome
      P-450 (P-450) content; levels of other microsomal haemoproteins were unaltered.
      Kinetic analysis of 2 mixed-function oxidase activities (aminopyrine
      N-demethylase and aniline p-hydroxylase) in primaquine-pretreated rat liver
      microsomes revealed a significant and similar decrease in the maximal reaction
      velocities of these enzymes (Vmax), but the apparent Michaelis constants (Km)
      were not changed. The activity of mitochondrial delta-aminolaevulinic acid
      synthetase (the rate-limiting step in haem biosynthesis) was normal in
      primaquine-pretreated rat liver but haem oxygenase activity (the rate-limiting
      step in haem degradation) was elevated approximately 2-fold. Haem availability
      for haemoprotein assembly (determined as the haem-saturation ratio of the
      cytosolic haemoprotein tryptophan pyrrolase) was also normal although the
      absolute activity of tryptophan pyrrolase was decreased after primaquine
      pretreatment. In order to facilitate an analysis of the P-450 isozyme profile in 
      control and primaquine-treated rat liver, total microsomal P-450 was isolated by 
      hydrophobic affinity chromatography on n-octylamino-Sepharose 4B. Densitometry of
      stained polyacrylamide gels following electrophoresis of these partially-purified
      P-450 fractions indicated that primaquine exposure did not selectively decrease
      any of the 3 protein bands in the P-450 molecular weight region (48-56 kD). These
      observations, when considered together, suggest that primaquine may affect P-450 
      and mixed-function oxidase activity by inhibition of protein synthesis. The
      characteristic rapid turnover rates of P-450 isozymes may predispose these
      haemoproteins to the toxic effects of primaquine whereas those haemoproteins that
      turn over less rapidly, such as cytochrome b5, appear to be less susceptible.
      Microsomal haem oxygenase activity may be elevated after primaquine
      administration since lowered haemoprotein requirements for haem could result in
      excess haem levels within the hepatocyte.

TI  - A comparative study of the reproductive effects of methadone and benzo[a]pyrene
      in the pregnant and pseudopregnant rat.
PG  - 195-204
AB  - Benzo[a]pyrene (BP; 50 mg/kg) or methadone (5 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously to 
      pregnant rats at different stages of gestation. Both BP and methadone affected
      the reproductive performance of pregnant rats by significantly increasing the
      number of resorptions and fetal wastage, and by decreasing the fetal weight. The 
      same dosage levels of BP and methadone were also given to pseudopregnant rats
      (PSP) with an induced decidual cell reaction (DCR) in an attempt to distinguish
      whether adverse effects occur in the maternal or fetal compartment or both. Since
      the hormonal requirements for DCR and implantation are similar and the
      anatomical, histological, cytological, time sequential changes as well as
      appearance of the vasculature system for DCR and decidua are indistinguishable,
      PSP with DCR is similar to pregnancy except for the lack of a fetal compartment. 
      BP, in this PSP model, significantly reduced the uterine wet weight and cyclic
      nucleotide (cAMP) and cGMP) levels whereas methadone was without a detectable
      effect. Our findings then suggest that BP may exert its effects adversely on both
      the maternal and fetal compartments, whereas methadone may act primarily in the
      fetal compartment.

TI  - The toxicity of tetrahydrobiopterin: acute and subchronic studies in mice.
PG  - 183-94
AB  - Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is presently being employed in clinical trials for the 
      therapy of various neurological disorders. The toxicity of BH4 in mice was
      analyzed by acute and subchronic intraperitoneal and acute oral survival studies.
      Organ weight analysis and histopathology were performed after acute and
      subchronic i.p. administration. The effect of probenecid on BH4 toxicity was also
      tested. An LD50 of approximately 260 mg/kg was obtained from acute (14-day)
      intraperitoneal survival studies. A dose-dependent increase in kidney weights and
      histopathologic evidence of acute toxic tubular necrosis were noted in acute i.p.
      studies. Acute oral administration of up to 1318 mg/kg BH4 did not cause any
      significant morbidity or mortality, nor did subchronic (92-day) i.p.
      administration of 10 or 50 mg/kg BH4. Probenecid pretreatment did not decrease
      the toxicity of BH4. The importance of further evaluation of the potential
      toxicity of tetrahydrobiopterin in clinical utilization is emphasized.

TI  - Mice exposed in utero to low concentrations of benzene exhibit enduring changes
      in their colony forming hematopoietic cells.
PG  - 171-81
AB  - Pregnant Swiss-Webster mice were exposed to either 0, 5, 10, or 20 ppm benzene
      from days 6 through 15 of gestation. Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays were
      performed on fetal, neonatal and adult progeny of the exposed dams. All
      concentrations of benzene employed induced marked changes in the numbers of the
      more differentiated erythroid colony forming cells, the CFU-E. Granulocytic
      colony forming cells (GM-CFU-C) were affected by the 2 higher exposure
      concentrations. When mice previously exposed in utero to 10 ppm benzene were
      re-exposed as adults, marked depressions in the numbers of CFU-E and GM-CFU-C
      were observed. Thus, in utero exposures to concentrations of benzene at the
      current occupational exposure limit induce alterations of the murine
      hematopoietic system which persist into adulthood.

TI  - Segmental and intracellular distribution of lead in rat kidney and salivary
      glands.
PG  - 157-70
AB  - The segmental and intracellular distribution of lead (Pb) was studied in the
      kidney and salivary gland of Sprague-Dawley rats. Lead acetate was administered
      i.v. in a single dose (10 or 65 mg/kg body wt) or multiple biweekly doses
      (subchronic: 7 X 10 mg/kg over 3 months; chronic: 13 X 10 mg/kg over 6 months).
      Segments of cortical nephrons and salivary glands were separated following tissue
      slicing, incubation with collagenase and centrifugation on a Percoll density
      gradient medium. Subcellular fractions were obtained by differential
      centrifugation of renal and salivary tissue homogenates. Lead was predominantly
      localized in the renal proximal tubules, which contained at least twice as much
      of the metal as the distal tubules. Segment populations prepared from salivary
      tissues contained far less Pb than the renal fractions and showed no clear
      differences among themselves in their affinity for the metal. Intracellular Pb
      distribution was as follows: kidney nuclei (Nu) greater than mitochondria (Mt)
      greater than cytosol (Cy) greater than microsomes (Mc); salivary gland Cy greater
      than Mc greater than Mt greater than Nu. In most cases, 45Ca followed the same
      intracellular distribution as lead. Our data suggest that the proximal tubular
      segment may be the most likely renal target of chronic lead toxicity. The results
      point also to a much greater retention of Pb by the kidney than by salivary
      glands. The ability of the kidney to accumulate a great deal of lead to be
      released into tubular fluid over long periods, makes urinary lead a poor
      indicator of duration and frequency of exposure. On the other hand, the inability
      of salivary glands to retain this metal makes saliva lead concentration a
      potential indicator of current exposure.

TI  - Kinetic analysis of acetylcholinesterase inhibition by combinations of acephate
      and methamidophos.
PG  - 143-56
AB  - Acephate pre-exposure provided protection against the inhibition of RBC and brain
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activities in rats
      exposed to both acephate and methamidophos. In vitro addition of acephate to AChE
      prior to or with methamidophos also provided complete protection against AChE
      inhibition by methamidophos. When acephate was added to the enzyme after
      methamidophos, its protective effect decreased with increasing time between the
      additions. Since acephate has greater affinity than does methamidophos for the
      AChE active site (Singh, A.K., Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 81 (1985) 302), it is
      proposed that acephate provided protection by binding with the AChE active site
      and, therefore, preventing methamidophos from binding with the enzyme. It is also
      proposed that acephate prevented the initial competitive binding of methamidophos
      to the AChE active site and delayed the initial sequence of events essential for 
      phosphorylation of AChE.

TI  - Effect of cadmium on essential metal concentrations in testis, liver and kidney
      of five inbred strains of mice.
PG  - 121-30
AB  - To compare the organ injuries by cadmium administration among inbred strains of
      mice, CdCl2 was injected subcutaneously into C3H/He, BALB/c, DBA/2, CBA/J and
      C57BL/6 strains at a dose of 30 mumol/kg body weight, and the changes of 6
      essential metal [sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron
      (Fe) and zinc (Zn)] concentrations were determined at 6, 24 and 48 h. Testicular 
      Cd concentrations at 6 h in DBA/2 and CBA/J were significantly higher than those 
      in the other 3 strains. Marked alterations in testicular metal concentrations
      (increases in Na, Ca and Fe and decreases in K and Mg) were observed in the 2
      strains. At 48 h, hepatic Cd concentration in BALB/c was decreased from the
      higher level at 24 h and an abrupt increase in renal Cd concentration was
      detected. Changes in hepatic essential metal concentrations at 48 h in BALB/c
      were in the same direction as those in the testis of DBA/2 and CBA/J. As a whole,
      C3H/He, BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains showed more remarkable alterations in hepatic 
      essential metal concentrations, except Zn level, than DBA/2 and CBA/J which
      showed larger increases in Zn concentration (probably due to larger
      metallothionein induction). It was suggested from the data that C3H/He, BALB/c
      and C57BL/6 were strains sensitive to the hepatotoxicity of Cd and that DBA/2 and
      CBA/J were susceptible to the testicular toxicity of Cd.

TI  - Cadmium uptake by rat red blood cells.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - Rat red blood cells were employed to study the uptake of cadmium (109Cd).
      Suspensions of red blood cells were exposed to Cd concentrations of 0.005-500
      microM, which were representative of whole blood concentrations (both bound and
      free) observed following in vivo Cd administration. Cd uptake was biphasic with
      an initial rapid phase (less than 1 min) followed by a slower second phase. The
      rate of Cd uptake at 25 degrees C was one-fourth of that at 37 degrees C. The
      metabolic inhibitors; sodium fluoride (1 mM), potassium cyanide (1 mM) and
      carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (2 microM) and the Na+-K+-ATPase
      inhibitor, ouabain (1 mM) did not reduce Cd (50 microM) uptake into red blood
      cells. This suggests that the uptake of Cd into red blood cells was not an active
      process. Incubation of Cd (10 microM) with an equimolar concentration of Zn did
      not alter uptake of Cd into red blood cells, but at 5 and 10 times higher
      concentrations of Zn, Cd uptake was enhanced 5-fold. Mercury at one-tenth and
      equimolar concentrations of Cd increased Cd uptake by red blood cells 2-fold.
      N-Ethylmaleimide (0.5-5 mM), which irreversibly inactivates membrane sulfhydryl
      groups, decreased Cd uptake. The data indicate that Cd uptake into rat red blood 
      cells occurs by passive transport and that alterations of sulfhydryls of red
      blood cell membrane may modulate the process.

      with subendothelium.
PG  - 837-47
AB  - Using the Baumgartner perfusion technique, marked sex-related differences in the 
      extent of platelet-subendothelium interaction and in the effect of aspirin (ASA) 
      have been observed. The administration of ASA (150 mg daily for 15 days) to two
      groups of healthy volunteers, one composed of males and the other of females,
      proved to block the generation of TXB2 in both cases. The basic pattern of
      platelet subendothelium interaction, however, was found to be markedly different 
      in both groups studied. In men, aspirin treatment induced a significant reduction
      in the percentage of platelet thrombi, whereas in women, post ASA values remained
      at the same level as in control experiments. These results show that in the
      Baumgartner perfusion system women display a less thrombogenic tendency than men 
      and that 150 mg of ASA administered daily are effective in reducing the extent of
      platelet-subendothelium interaction in the male group but not in the female
      group. These findings could explain the absence of benefit observed for women in 
      clinical trials with aspirin.

      gerbils.
PG  - 817-28
AB  - The effect of naloxone on blood platelet aggregation and cerebral blood flow in
      gerbils was studied. Administration of naloxone in dose 1 mg/kg to intact gerbils
      resulted in a marked increase in platelet aggregability accompanied by 27%
      reduction in cerebral blood flow. Focal cerebral ischemic injury significantly
      enhanced platelet aggregatory response and treatment with naloxone was without
      any additional effect on platelet aggregation. Cerebral blood flow in ischemic
      hemisphere, however, increased following naloxone injection by 46%. In vitro
      naloxone in millimolar concentrations inhibited platelet aggregation in a
      dose-dependent way. Apparent decrease in fluorescence of platelet membranes
      tagged with fluorescence probe due to naloxone suggests conformational changes in
      platelet membrane as a primary mechanism for the antiaggregatory effect of
      naloxone in vitro.

PG  - 793-806
AB  - When added to platelet-rich plasma, aqueous extracts of garlic inhibited platelet
      aggregation and the release reaction. Subsequent experiments designed to
      characterize the inhibitory component revealed that the inhibitory activity was
      i) associated with small molecular-weight components, ii) the inhibitory
      component possessed the typical garlic odor and contained an abundance of sulfur,
      iii) the inhibitory activity could be extracted with organic solvents, and iv)
      temperatures above 56 degrees C and alkaline pH above 8.5 quickly destroyed the
      inhibitory activity. The Rf value of the major inhibitory component after
      thin-layer chromatographic separation was similar to that of allicin, an unique
      thiosulfinate in garlic previously shown to possess strong antibiotic and
      antifungal properties. Allicin was synthesized. On thin-layer chromatographic
      plates, allicin co-migrated with the inhibitory component in garlic. At 10 microM
      concentration, allicin inhibited completely platelet aggregation and the release 
      reaction. Comparative studies suggest that the major platelet aggregation and
      release inhibitor in garlic may be allicin.

      prostatic cancer treated with oestrogen or orchidectomy.
PG  - 783-91
AB  - The treatment of prostatic cancer with oestrogen has been reported to be
      associated with cardiovascular side effects. Twenty patients with recently
      diagnosed prostatic cancer were randomly allocated to oestrogen therapy or
      orchidectomy. As compared to healthy age matched controls the patients with
      prostatic cancer had increased base-line levels of fibrinogen (5.2 +/- 1.9 g/l
      versus 3.7 +/- 1.0 g/l; p less than 0.002) and factor VIII:C (166 +/- 62% versus 
      110 +/- 29%; p less than 0.001). During oestrogen therapy factor VII increased
      from 99 +/- 22% to 150 +/- 47% (p less than 0.001), while the antithrombin III
      level fell from 93 +/- 10% to 81 +/- 13% (p less than 0.001). Both these changes 
      are in the direction of a hypercoaguable state. Concomitantly plasminogen
      increased from 113 +/- 14% to 142 +/- 18% (p less than 0.001), urokinase
      inhibiting activity fell from 105 +/- 10% to 90 +/- 9% (p less than 0.001) and
      C1-esterase inhibitor fell from 110 +/- 17% to 86 +/- 22% (p less than 0.05) in
      the oestrogen therapy group. After orchidectomy there were no changes in the
      activators and inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis studied as compared to 
      base-line values. Furthermore the D dimer, a specific degradation product of
      crosslinked fibrin increased from a normal to a pathological value in 4 out of 8 
      tested patients after 6 weeks of oestrogen therapy, but in none out of 9 tested
      patients in the orchidectomy group. Briefly stated, patients with prostatic
      cancer treated with oestrogen have increased levels of factor VII, factor VIII:C 
      and fibrinogen and a decreased level of antithrombin III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

PG  - 771-82
AB  - We studied functional protein C activity, both anticoagulant and amidolytic, as
      well as protein C antigen in 30 normal subjects, several members of a family with
      congenital protein C deficiency, 18 patients with severe preeclampsia, 27
      patients with coronary heart disease, including 15 patients with myocardial
      infarction and 12 with angina pectoris, 20 patients on stable oral anticoagulant 
      therapy (thrombotest values: 3-12%) and three patients with disseminated
      intravascular coagulation. Protein C values measured by the coagulant assay were 
      compared to those obtained with amidolytic and immunochemical assays. In all the 
      groups studied, the activity assays (amidolytic and coagulant) correlated
      significantly with each other as well as with the immunochemical assay. In
      patients on oral anticoagulant therapy the coagulant assay gave lower protein C
      values than amidolytic and immunochemical assays. A good correlation was found
      between immunological and amidolytic protein C assays (r=0.90, p less than
      0.001), immunological and coagulant protein C assays (r=0.93, p less than 0.001),
      and amidolytic and coagulant protein C assays (r=0.95, p less than 0.001) in all 
      the samples studied without including the protein C values of patients on oral
      anticoagulant therapy. These results allow us to recommend the functional protein
      C coagulant assay in patients on stable oral anticoagulant therapy because only
      this assay evaluates the "in vivo" protein C function in these patients.

TI  - Thrombin inactivation on surfaces with covalently bonded heparin.
PG  - 739-48
AB  - About 8000 Daltons porcine mucosa heparin fragments were covalently bonded by
      end-point attachment to polyethylene. The interaction between the immobilized
      heparin, added thrombin, and antithrombin III [AT] was investigated. The heparin 
      surface was adsorbed with either albumin, AT dissolved in albumin or Tyrode, or
      platelet free plasma. Irrespective of the pre-treatment procedure, exposure of
      the surface to thrombin resulted in the same substantial decrease of thrombin in 
      solution and the same degree of surface-confined thrombin activity. It was
      concluded that the heparin surface has a large capacity to bind thrombin and that
      the thrombin inhibitory capacity of high affinity heparin fragments is limited.
      On exposure of the thrombin-loaded surfaces to defibrinogenated plasma or AT, the
      surface-confined thrombin was inhibited within 30 seconds. Successive dilutions
      of plasma or AT decreased the inhibition rate but not the inhibition capacity. It
      is concluded that inhibition of thrombin adsorbed on the heparin surface occurs
      as follows: Added AT adheres to high affinity heparin fragments on the surface
      whereupon adsorbed thrombin migrates in the hydrophilic heparin coating towards
      the reaction site of AT and becomes inhibited. The inactivated thrombin-AT
      complex leaves then the surface, thus enabling the process to be repeated.

TI  - A latex immunoassay of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products in plasma using a
      monoclonal antibody.
PG  - 715-28
AB  - We have developed a latex immunoassay using an anti D neo monoclonal antibody
      (F2C5) which recognizes an epitope present in fragment D but which is hidden in
      intact fibrinogen and in early fibrinogen degradation products. This technique
      was applied directly to plasma of both healthy donors and patients, and was shown
      to be very convenient for clinical investigation, especially in emergency cases
      for diagnosis of intravascular coagulation. The use of plasma samples instead of 
      serum offers several advantages: it is not time consuming since blood clotting is
      not required; it avoids overestimation when fibrinogen cannot be totally clotted,
      and underestimation due to the binding of nonclottable fibrin degradation
      products to the clot during clotting in vitro. This monoclonal antibody, which
      reacts more with FbDP (expressed in fragment D) than with fragment D, does not
      allow fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products to be differentiated. However,
      this discrimination does not seem critical for its clinical use since the level
      of fragment D neo antigen remained within the normal range in 12 cases of
      spontaneous or venous occlusion-induced hyperfibrinolysis.

PG  - 2343-50
AB  - The acetyltransferase activity of neutrophils from patients with inflammatory
      disorders was assayed using the homogenate preparation of neutrophils. The enzyme
      activity was evaluated on both non-stimulated and stimulated neutrophils. The
      enzyme activity of neutrophils from 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 10 
      patients with Behcet's disease was not significantly different from that of the
      control group. In contrast, it was significantly elevated in patients with
      bacterial infection, especially that of non-stimulated cells. The increase in the
      enzyme activity best correlated with the degree of fever. The elevated enzyme
      activity tended to normalize during convalescence.

      nephrotoxicity.
PG  - 2335-42
AB  - Male Fischer 344 rats classified as young (2-4 months), middle-aged (12-14
      months) and aged (22-25 months) received 300, 600 or 800 mg/kg acetaminophen
      (APAP) intraperitoneally and were sacrificed 24 hr later. Blood urea nitrogen
      (BUN) concentration and urinary glucose and osmolality were determined. In
      addition, kidneys were evaluated for histopathological changes. APAP did not
      affect osmolality or BUN concentrations and failed to produce lesions after any
      dose in young rats. Osmolality was decreased 40% and 50% in middle-aged and aged 
      rats, respectively, after 800 mg/kg APAP. Glucosuria was prominent in aged rats
      after the 600 and 800 mg/kg doses were administered, while middle-aged rats
      showed little glucosuria after these doses. BUN concentrations were elevated 89% 
      and 183% in middle-aged and aged rats, respectively, given 600 mg/kg APAP; after 
      800 mg/kg, BUN concentrations were elevated approximately four-fold in both age
      groups. Pathological evaluations showed a greater incidence of acute tubular
      necrosis (ATN) in aged kidneys compared to kidneys of middle-aged rats after 600 
      mg/kg, while the two older groups exhibited similar, more severe ATN after 800
      mg/kg APAP. These data suggest an age-related increased susceptibility of male
      Fisher 344 rats to APAP nephrotoxicity.

TI  - Influence of an extract of Ginkgo biloba on cerebral blood flow and metabolism.
PG  - 2327-34
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effects of an extract
      of Ginkgo biloba (EGB) on blood glucose levels, on local cerebral blood flow as
      well as on cerebral glucose concentration and consumption. The local cerebral
      blood flow (LCBF) was measured in conscious rats by means of the
      14C-iodoantipyrine technique and local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) by
      14C-2-deoxy-glucose autoradiography. EGB increased the LCBF in 39 analyzed,
      anatomically defined brain structures by 50 to 100 per cent. No influence of EGB 
      on LCGU was demonstrable. However, EGB enhanced the blood glucose level
      dose-dependently. Substrates and metabolites of energy metabolism were measured
      in the cortex of the isolated rat brain perfused at constant rate and with 7
      mmol/l glucose added to the perfusion medium. In these experiments EGB decreased 
      the cortical glucose concentration without other substrate levels being changed. 
      These results suggest that glucose uptake may be inhibited by EGB. It is argued
      that the effects of EGB on brain glucose concentration and blood flow may
      contribute to its protection of brain tissue against ischemic or hypoxic damage.

TI  - Dissociation of morphine withdrawal diarrhea and jumping in mice by the
      peripherally selective opioid antagonist SR 58002 C.
PG  - 2297-303
AB  - Mice were rendered physically dependent by repeated administration of morphine,
      25 mg/kg s.c., 5 times daily for 4 days, and on the 5th day, 2 h after the last
      morphine dose, they were challenged with a s.c. injection of either naloxone, 25 
      mg/kg, or the peripherally selective opioid antagonist SR 58002 C (N-methyl
      levallorphan mesilate), 75 mg/kg. Naloxone provoked jumping and diarrhea in all
      the animals; mice challenged with SR 58002 C presented no significant jumping but
      a high frequency of withdrawal diarrhea. When naloxone, 12 mg/kg, or SR 58002 C, 
      50 mg/kg, were given s.c. in combination with repeated morphine as above, mice
      which had received naloxone with morphine presented virtually no diarrhea or
      jumping upon naloxone challenge; those repeatedly treated with morphine plus SR
      58002 C were substantially protected from naloxone-precipitated diarrhea, but not
      jumping. These results further support the remarkable selectivity for peripheral 
      opioid receptors of SR 58002 C, even after repeated high-dose treatment, and are 
      strongly consistent with the primary role of a local intestinal mechanism in the 
      development and expression of opioid withdrawal diarrhea in mice. The in vivo
      dissociation of central and peripheral components of dependence on morphine is
      illustrated, apparently for the first time.

PG  - 2289-96
AB  - The effects of subchronic administration of imipramine (IMIP), chlorpromazine
      (CPZ) and the combination of IMIP + CPZ on 3H-IMIP binding of rat blood platelets
      and cortex were studied. All three treatments decreased the number of IMIP
      binding sites (Bmax) of rat blood platelets and cortex. The combination produced 
      a significantly greater decrease in Bmax in platelets than either treatment
      alone; a similar trend in cortex was observed. The effect of some neuroleptics on
      3H-IMIP binding sites may be relevant to their antidepressant action. These
      results, together with previous evidence that the combination has a synergistic
      effect on down regulation of brain serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors, suggest that
      changes in serotonergic neurotransmission may be relevant to the enhanced
      efficacy of the combination of tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics,
      compared to either type of drug alone, in the treatment of delusional depression.

TI  - Development of segmental differences in the pressure mechanosensory neurons of
      the leech Haementeria ghilianii.
PG  - 403-9
AB  - Using a monoclonal antibody specific for the pressure mechanosensory neurons (P
      cells) of the leech Haementeria ghilianii, we have examined the segmental
      differences between P cells in the adult nerve cord, as well as the development
      of these differences during embryogenesis. The standard segmental ganglion
      contains two pairs of P cells of about the same size and staining intensity. The 
      sex ganglia appear to be missing the P cells that normally innervate ventral
      skin, and ganglia 20 and 21 have much smaller ventral P cells than most segments.
      The pattern of P cells in the head and tail ganglia also differs slightly from
      that of the standard ganglia. During embryogenesis, when the neurons are first
      stained by the antibody, there are two pairs of P cells of equal size in each
      segmental ganglion. Obvious segmental differences arise subsequently, modifying
      an initially identical set of cells.

TI  - Stages in the structural differentiation of retinal ganglion cells.
PG  - 382-402
AB  - Using a cultured wholemount technique we have studied the morphological
      differentiation of ganglion cells in the retina of the rat and cat, during normal
      development. In both species the differentiation of ganglion cells begins in
      embryonic life, before embryonic day (E) 17 in the rat and E36 in the cat. It is 
      useful to describe the morphological differentiation of ganglion cells as
      occurring in three stages. In the first stage, each germinal cell becoming a
      ganglion cell extends an axon into the fibre layer of the retina and towards the 
      optic disc, and the soma of the cell moves towards the ganglion cell layer. As
      the soma approaches the ganglion cell layer, the processes that attach its poles 
      to the inner and outer surfaces of the retina are withdrawn. When the soma
      reaches the ganglion cell layer, a stage of active dendritic growth begins, which
      lasts until shortly before birth in the cat and until several days after birth in
      the rat. The cell extends stem dendrites that branch profusely and are commonly
      tipped by growth cones. The major morphological classes of ganglion cell become
      distinct in the latter part of stage 2, as do the centroperipheral gradients in
      ganglion cell size apparent in the cat. During the third stage, the dendritic
      trees of ganglion cells no longer branch or extend by means of active growth
      cones. Very considerable growth of all parameters of the cell (soma size,
      dendrite calibre and length, axon calibre) occurs nevertheless, presumably by
      interstitial addition of membrane throughout the cell.

TI  - The ipsilateral retinocollicular projection in the rabbit: an autoradiographic
      study of postnatal development and effects of unilateral enucleation.
PG  - 369-81
AB  - The postnatal development of the ipsilateral retinocollicular projection in the
      rabbit and the effects of unilateral enucleation (performed on the day of birth, 
      day 0) on that development were studied by using the anterograde axonal transport
      of tritiated proline injected intraocularly. Material from 1-, 6-, and 10-day-old
      (i.e., at days 1, 6, and 10) and adult animals was examined. On day 1,
      autoradiographically labelled optic fibers from the ipsilateral eye formed
      distinct patches and bands within the superior colliculus (SC), which were
      restricted primarily to the lateral one-half and anterior one-third to one-half
      of the nucleus. At subsequent ages no major changes in the location of this
      projection were found for normal animals or animals enucleated on day 0 (0-DE
      animals). From dorsal-view reconstructions, the pattern of the ipsilateral
      projection appeared wedge-shaped with a broad base aligned with the lateral SC
      border for all normal and 0-DE animals at the various postnatal ages examined. In
      normal animals the surface area of this projection increased with age and
      maintained a constant proportion of the increasing surface area of the total SC. 
      In 0-DE animals the surface area of the projection initially increased more
      rapidly than in normal animals. Thus, by day 6 the area was already within the
      normal adult range but did not exceed this range at later postnatal ages. The
      only obvious difference in the appearance of the ipsilateral retinocollicular
      projection between normal and 0-DE animals at corresponding ages was an enhanced 
      radial distribution of the projection across laminae in the 0-DE animals. Taken
      together these findings suggest that, in the rabbit, once topographically
      appropriate connections are established between the SC and the ipsilateral
      retinal projection, they are maintained regardless of substantial postnatal
      growth of the SC and removal of the contralateral retinal projection to the SC.

TI  - Distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal region of the rabbit: I. 
      Entorhinal area, parasubiculum, and presubiculum.
PG  - 352-68
AB  - The distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was examined in three areas of
      the hippocampal region of adult rabbit, viz., the entorhinal area, the
      parasubiculum, and the presubiculum. AChE was demonstrated histochemically
      according to a modification of the Koelle copper thiocholine method. In each of
      the examined areas the pattern of AChE was distinctly stratified and corresponded
      extensively to fields and layers defined on the basis of cyto- and
      fibro-architectonics. The enzyme activity was mainly present in the neuropil, but
      in addition, moderately to weakly stained nerve cell bodies were seen scattered
      in the entorhinal area and the presubiculum. Only a very small minority of the
      total number of neuronal somata showed an intense staining reaction for AChE. Two
      subfields were discernible in the entorhinal area, these being termed pars
      medialis and pars lateralis. Pars medialis showed a distinctly stratified enzyme 
      distribution, whereas stratification was less conspicuous in pars lateralis,
      especially at basal levels. The deep cortical layers (IV-VI) showed a similar
      distribution of AChE in all three areas--a medium-stained layer IV, a weakly
      stained layer V, and a weakly to moderately stained layer VI. However, at more
      dorsal horizontal levels of pars medialis, heavily stained patches occurred in
      layer IV. In the entorhinal area, the superficial cortical layers (I-III)
      contained most enzyme activity in the superficial two-thirds of layer I, the
      interstices between the stellate cell bodies in layer II, and the superficial
      part of layer III. In the parasubiculum, layers I-III formed a wedge-shaped field
      with a very high content of AChE. The presubiculum was well stained in layers I
      and III, whereas the densely packed cell bodies of layer II were unstained. The
      distribution of AChE in the rabbit was compared with that in the rat and guinea
      pig, previously described. The staining pattern is fundamentally similar in all
      three species, but certain clear differences exist. Possible structural
      correlates to the AChE observed in the three areas are considered in detail,
      especially the relation to the distribution of afferent systems known from
      experimental studies in other animal species. Although a substantial amount of
      the enzyme is probably associated with the septohippocampal projection, at
      present it cannot be excluded that other fiber systems may account for some of
      the observed AChE.

PG  - 341-51
AB  - The present series of experiments was designed to study details of the morphology
      and connectivity of functionally identified cells located in the paratracheal
      ganglia of the ferret. The morphology of 11 spiking (AH cells) and seven
      nonspiking (type B cells) ganglion cells was examined. Intra-axonally injected
      horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as the label. Each spiking and nonspiking
      cell was identified by intracellular recording prior to the HRP injection. "Whole
      mount preparations" were processed for HRP histochemistry with diaminobenzidine
      as the chromogen. HRP-labeled cell bodies of both the spiking AH and nonspiking
      type B neurons demonstrated similar morphological features. Both types of
      ganglion cells showed axons arising from a small, ill-defined axon hillock which 
      exited from the cell as single or multiple branches of equal diameter and coursed
      unidirectionally through the interganglionic nerve trunk to an adjacent ganglion;
      short, fine, tapering processes (presumptive dendrites) in the immediate vicinity
      of the injected cell; and processes extending out of the ganglion cell
      perpendicular to the interganglionic nerve trunk which could be followed into the
      smooth muscle. Extraperikaryal injections of HRP into a ganglion retrogradely
      labeled perikarya in the adjacent ganglia. These results demonstrate that in
      airway ganglia the morphology of spiking and nonspiking neurons is remarkably
      similar despite electrophysiological differences. In addition it appears that
      ganglion cells project to adjacent ganglia and to smooth muscle by means of
      independent axonal processes. These morphological features of the ganglion cells 
      in airways and the trajectories of their axons correspond to known features of
      their physiology: i.e., the axon of a ganglion cell travels unidirectionally
      toward the adjacent ganglion and arborizes there, providing anatomical evidence
      of communication between ganglia via the interganglionic nerve trunk; and the
      spiking and nonspiking neurons possess similar morphological features that are
      typical of ganglion cells described in other systems, such as in the myenteric
      plexus.

AB  - The sensory projections and the motor complex of the trigeminal nerve of the
      reptile Varanus exanthematicus were studied with the methods of anterograde
      degeneration and anterograde and retrograde axonal transport. The primary
      afferent fibers diverge in the brainstem into a short ascending and a long
      descending tract. The former distributes its fibers to the principal sensory
      trigeminal nucleus, where nerves V1, V2, and V3 are represented along a
      lateromedial axis. The fibers of the descending tract enter the nucleus of this
      tract and the reticular formation. Both in the tract and its nucleus, nerves V1, 
      V2 and V3 occupy successively more dorsal positions. A small contingent of nerve 
      V1 fibers course to the accessory abducens nucleus. The descending tract extends 
      caudally into the first and second cervical segments of the spinal cord. The
      trigeminal motor complex consists of dorsal, ventral, and dorsomedial nuclei. The
      m. adductor mandibulae externus (the main jaw closer) is represented in the
      dorsal nucleus, predominantly in its rostral part. The muscles innervated by
      nerve V3 are represented in the ventral nucleus, mainly in its caudal part. All
      three divisions of the trigeminal nerve contain peripheral branches of the
      mesencephalic trigeminal system. Collaterals of the central branches of this
      system were traced to the ventral motor and the principal sensory trigeminal
      nuclei.

TI  - A quantitative electron microscopic study of the intracellular localization of
      wheat germ agglutinin in retinal neurons.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Previous work has established that, following endocytosis, wheat germ agglutinin,
      like a number of other plasma membrane bound ligands, is transported to the Golgi
      apparatus-complex. Previous studies that provided qualitative information about
      the intracellular distribution of internalized wheat germ agglutinin used
      techniques that precluded any quantitative conclusions about the relative
      magnitude of the labeling of endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi
      apparatus-complex. Using quantitative ultrastructural autoradiography, this study
      compares the time course and relative magnitude of labeling of various
      intracellular compartments to the labeling in the Golgi area. Fifteen minutes
      after intraocular injection, wheat germ agglutinin is confined to the inner
      surface of the retina and the immediate subsurface neuropil with little labeling 
      of the retinal ganglion cell perikarya. Thirty minutes after injection, the
      plasma membrane (6.97 +/- 1.17), endosomes (10.27 +/- 3.98), smooth vesicles and 
      tubules (1.94 +/- 1.66), and lysosomes (2.42 +/- 1.21) of the retinal ganglion
      cells are labeled, while the Golgi apparatus-complex is not labeled (0.29 +/-
      0.25). (Figures in parentheses are the calculated relative radioactive source
      density +/- the standard deviation.) The relative labeling density of the plasma 
      membrane and endosomes decreases somewhat during the next 90 minutes (plasma
      membrane, 4.76 +/- 0.67; endosomes, 7.23 +/- 2.02), while the labeling density of
      smooth vesicles and tubules and of lysosomes rises (smooth vesicles and tubules, 
      5.56 +/- 0.94; lysosomes, 7.76 +/- 1.56). The Golgi apparatus-complex, which is
      unlabeled at 30 minutes, is weakly labeled at 2 hours (1.26 +/- 0.28). The fact
      that the lysosomes are already labeled at 30 minutes while the Golgi
      apparatus-complex is unlabeled at that time indicates that the transport of wheat
      germ agglutinin to the Golgi apparatus-complex is a relatively late phenomenon,
      and suggests that the bulk of the wheat germ agglutinin destined for lysosomes
      does not pass through the Golgi apparatus-complex.

TI  - Peptidergic innervation of insect reproductive tissue: the association of
      proctolin with oviduct visceral musculature.
PG  - 279-86
AB  - The visceral muscles of the oviducts of Locusta migratoria are sensitive to the
      pentapeptide proctolin (H-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Thr-OH). Amounts of proctolin as low as
      2 fmol induce a tonic contraction that is dose-dependent up to 200 fmol. By use
      of this bioassay we have quantified the amount of material showing proctolinlike 
      bioactivity associated with the oviducts. Reversed-phase high performance liquid 
      chromatography of tissue extracts indicates that material with proctolinlike
      bioactivity and co-eluting with proctolin is present in the oviducts, the
      oviducal nerve, and the VIIth abdominal (penultimate) ganglion. The proctolin is 
      present in areas of oviduct that receive extensive innervation. There is tenfold 
      less proctolin in areas of oviduct that receive little or no innervation.
      Proctolinlike immunoreactivity is present in axons of the oviducal nerve as well 
      as in a number of cell bodies in the VIIth abdominal ganglion. Three of these
      neurons lie in a position similar to that of the previously described oviduct
      motoneurons. Neuropilar axons and processes, as well as axons in the median
      nerve, also show proctolinlike immunoreactivity. The results indicate that
      proctolin, which has previously been identified as a neurotransmitter of insect
      hindgut visceral muscle, is also associated with visceral muscle of the
      reproductive system.

TI  - Surgical management of chronic laminitis in horses: 13 cases (1983-1985).
PG  - 1604-6
AB  - Thirteen horses with chronic refractory laminitis were evaluated and treated. In 
      each horse, deep digital flexor tenotomy was performed on all affected limbs at
      the level of the midpastern. Five horses returned to limited athletic endeavors, 
      6 horses improved and were comfortable on pasture, 1 horse improved clinically,
      but was euthanatized for economic reasons, and 1 horse improved, but deteriorated
      9 months after surgery and was euthanatized. Results of this study indicated that
      deep digital flexor tenotomy at the level of the midpastern can be used
      effectively as a salvage procedure in horses with chronic refractory laminitis.

TI  - Cellulitis associated with coagulase-positive staphylococci in racehorses: nine
      cases (1975-1984).
PG  - 1600-3
AB  - Nine Thoroughbred racehorses were admitted with cellulitis (of one or more limbs)
      associated with coagulase-positive staphylococci. The right hindlimb was affected
      in 4 horses, the right forelimb in 2, the left hindlimb in 1, and both hindlimbs 
      in 2. Typical abnormalities included high values for rectal temperature (9
      horses) and heart rate (5 horses), hyperfibrinogenemia (7 horses), leukocytosis
      (7 horses), and neutrophilia (6 horses). The staphylococcal isolants were
      speciated in 3 horses and classified as Staphylococcus aureus. Complications
      included skin loss (5 horses), laminitis of the affected limb (2 horses),
      laminitis of the contralateral limb (4 horses), osteomyelitis and sequestrum
      formation (2 horses), and bacteremia (1 horse). Five horses were euthanatized
      because of the severity of the complications, ie, laminitis in 4 horses and
      severe skin loss in 1 horse. The remaining 4 horses were discharged from the
      clinic. At follow-up evaluation (mean, 16.7 months), the swelling in 3 of the
      horses had completely resolved. One horse returned to racing; of 2 used for
      pleasure riding, one was mildly lame. The remaining horse was not lame, but was
      used for breeding because of persistent swelling of the affected limb.

AB  - Three heifers with the thymic form of lymphosarcoma were examined. In each of the
      3 cases, fever, bloat, and jugular venous distention had developed. Detectable
      antibody to bovine leukosis virus was not found on agar gel immunodiffusion
      testing in any of the cases. Thymic lymphosarcoma was confirmed by necropsy and
      histologic examination. Thymic lymphosarcoma must be considered in the
      differential diagnosis in heifers with fever, bloat, and jugular venous
      distention.

PG  - 1596-7
AB  - A 3.6-year-old female Collie was found to have a functionally active ovary and an
      azospermic testis containing several seminomas. The bitch had had 3 irregular
      estrous cycles. An ovariohysterectomy was performed, and the histopathologic
      diagnosis was lateral hermaphroditism and seminoma. Canine intersexes generally
      have been thought not to have estrous cycles. However, as evidenced in this case,
      estrous activity can occur. From this report, it is suggested that bitches having
      irregular estrous cycles should be evaluated for intersexuality.

PG  - 1591-5
AB  - One goat anesthetized with thiamylal sodium, xylazine, and halothane for repair
      of an abominal hernia, and 7 of 29 goats similarly anesthetized for an experiment
      unrelated to considerations of anesthesia, developed signs of hepatic failure
      within 24 hours of anesthesia. Affected goats had high values for serum aspartate
      transaminase and serum total bilirubin by 12 to 24 hours after induction of
      anesthesia. Necropsy of the 8 affected goats revealed centrilobular to massive
      hepatic necrosis (8 of 8), brain lesions consistent with hepatic encephalopathy
      (3 of 4), and acute renal tubular necrosis (6 of 6). Two unaffected goats had no 
      hepatic necrosis. Causes of hepatic necrosis other than those related to
      anesthesia (eg, infectious agents, toxins) were ruled out by lack of supporting
      necropsy findings or were considered unlikely because of lack of opportunity for 
      exposure. Hepatic lesions in these goats closely resembled those described in
      human beings with halothane-associated hepatic injury, although in both species
      these lesions are nonspecific at the gross and light microscopic levels. The
      pathogenesis of halothane-associated hepatic injury in goats, as in human beings,
      remains to be determined.

TI  - Generalized nodular dermatofibrosis and renal cystadenocarcinomas in a German
      shepherd dog.
PG  - 1587-90
AB  - Generalized, nodular dermatofibrosis with coexisting bilateral renal
      cystadenocarcinomas was diagnosed in a 6-year-old male German Shepherd Dog.
      Approximately 3 years earlier, the dog had been examined because of lameness
      attributable to 2 nodular growths between the third and fourth digits of the
      right front limb. Biopsy revealed dense collagenous dermal fibrosis, often in a
      nodular arrangement. As the disease progressed, attempts to alleviate the
      discomfort and lameness caused by the nodular growths were performed by surgical 
      excision. During this period, other nodular growths that developed apparently did
      not bother the dog. Because of the long and protracted clinical progression of
      the disease and poor prognosis for successful treatment, the dog was
      euthanatized. At necropsy, multiple multicentric nodules were found in the skin
      and subcutis, with most located on the limbs. The nodules were well-circumscribed
      and hard. Epithelial ulceration and inflammation were confined to nodules on the 
      feet. Small foci of collagenous proliferation were found along fascial planes. In
      addition, cystic neoplasms were in both kidneys. The microscopic diagnosis was
      generalized nodular dermatofibrosis, with bilateral renal cystadenocarcinomas.

TI  - Blindness and convulsions associated with vitamin A deficiency in feedlot steers.
PG  - 1579-82
AB  - Blindness and convulsions were the predominant clinical signs in a group of
      feedlot steers inadvertently fed a vitamin-A deficient diet. Although vitamin A
      had been added to the feed at the time of preparation, it was believed that the
      vitamin A had been destroyed by heat, humidity, and minerals mixed in the feed.
      Feedlot heifers fed the same high-grain diet were clinically normal, and one
      heifer from which a blood sample was obtained had normal serum vitamin A content.
      The ingestion of sparse grasses and weeds found along the fence row of the
      heifers' pens was thought to have provided sufficient vitamin A to these animals.
      This episode demonstrated the importance of monitoring vitamin A and vitamin A
      precursor concentrations in stored feeds, especially those stored under adverse
      conditions and those fed to animals ingesting only a high-grain diet.

PG  - 1572-4
AB  - Several factors, including age, sex, race number, post position, and race class, 
      were evaluated for relationships to prerace percentage body weight loss and
      performance in all Greyhounds racing during August 1983 in Oregon. The incidence 
      of percentage body weight loss greater than or equal to 2.5% was low (5%). Race
      number had a direct effect on weight loss; the later the dogs raced, the more
      weight loss they experienced. Female dogs were 3 times more likely to lose
      greater than 2.4% of body weight than males. All dogs experiencing greater than
      2.4% body weight loss were 2 times more likely to finish in the first 3 places
      when racing in the first 5 races overall. In addition, males losing greater than 
      2.4% of body weight performed better than females when racing together in the
      final 6 races. Males appeared to be better performers than females, as they were 
      twice as likely to be in class A races. However, once in the race, males and
      females performed equally.

TI  - Prostaglandin F2 alpha treatment of canine pyometra.
PG  - 1557-61
AB  - Immediate and long-term outcomes of prostaglandin F2 alpha treatment for canine
      pyometra were studied in 10 bitches. Examination of pretreatment uterine biopsy
      specimens, taken for histopathologic diagnosis and classification of disease
      severity, revealed either type III or IV pyometra. Dinoprost tromethamine (0.25
      or 0.5 mg/kg of body weight, SC) was given once daily for 3 days. Bitches were
      bred at the first posttreatment estrus and monitored for a minimum of one year.
      When pure cultures of Escherichia coli (n = 3) or Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1)
      were obtained from the vagina, these bacteria also were found in the uterus.
      Pretreatment WBC counts often did not reflect the severity of histopathologic
      findings in the uterus, but posttreatment WBC counts were useful in monitoring
      response to treatment. Four bitches produced a litter within one year of
      treatment. Four bitches (40%) had recurrence of pyometra within one year of
      treatment, and these same bitches had another recurrence after an additional
      prostaglandin treatment. Three additional bitches had a recurrence by 27 months
      after therapy, establishing a total recurrence rate of 77% (7/9). Results
      suggested that subclinical disease may persist after treatment, with clinical
      recurrence during diestrus. Despite the high recurrence rate, it was concluded
      that this treatment is a practical treatment for canine pyometra when
      reproduction is desired.

TI  - Control of human melanoma growth in nude mice by autologous allo-activated
      peripheral blood lymphocytes.
PG  - 923-7
AB  - Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were activated in vitro by means of a
      pool of allogeneic PBL from normal donors and then evaluated for in vivo activity
      against human melanoma cells xenografted in splenectomized and irradiated athymic
      (nude) mice. The subcutaneous (s.c.) growth of human melanoma cells was inhibited
      by intravenous (i.v.) injection, 2 hr later, of such allo-activated, autologous
      and allogeneic PBL in 7/8 and in 6/9 mice respectively. Unstimulated PBL were
      ineffective. When allo-activated patients' lymphocytes were administered 3 days
      after s.c. implantation of autologous melanoma cells, inhibition of tumor growth 
      was observed in 1/6 mice. A significant delay in tumor appearance was noted in
      the remaining animals. Unstimulated as well as allo-activated,
      lymphokine-releasing helper-enriched human PBL had no effect on melanoma
      xenografts, indicating that the tumor inhibition by tumor-cytotoxic
      allo-activated PBL was not due to recruitment of murine immuno-competent cells by
      human lymphokines. These results indicate that allo-stimulated, tumor-cytotoxic
      human PBL given i.v. to nude mice can circulate and inhibit the growth of
      autologous or allogeneic human melanoma cells implanted s.c.

TI  - Specific inhibition of human natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity by sialic 
      acid and sialo-oligosaccharides.
PG  - 915-22
AB  - We have tried to identify carbohydrate structures involved in recognition and/or 
      lysis of K562 target cells by human natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibition studies
      were performed with mono-, di- and trisaccharides, and with glycopeptides and
      glycoproteins of known carbohydrate composition. When tested with various
      monosaccharides, lysis of K562 cells was inhibited only by N-acetylneuraminic
      acid (NeuAc). Di- and trisaccharides and glycopeptides containing NeuAc or
      N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) all inhibited NK cell-mediated lysis. Among the
      non-sialylated carbohydrates tested, only Gal beta(1----3)GalNAcol was effective.
      The inhibitory capacity of sialylated compounds appeared to be dependent on the
      linkage type of the sialic acid residue; carbohydrates containing
      alpha(2----6)-linked sialic acids were more potent inhibitors than their
      alpha(2----3) isomers. Also the sugar to which the sialic acid residue was
      attached was of importance, NeuAc alpha(2----6)GalNAcol being more effective than
      NeuAc alpha(2----6)Gal beta 1----R (where R = glucose or
      oligosaccharide-peptide). Sialylated compounds and free sialic acid had minor or 
      no effects on cell-mediated cytotoxicity by allo-sensitized cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes. The conjugation of target cells and NK effector cells was not
      inhibited by carbohydrates that effectively blocked the cytolytic response. These
      results may indicate that cell-surface carbohydrates containing
      alpha(2----6)-linked sialic acid are crucial structures in a post-binding event
      in NK-cell-mediated lysis.

TI  - Vitamin-K-dependent proteins in microsomes of primary Lewis lung tumors.
PG  - 877-82
AB  - Microsomes isolated from Lewis lung (LL) primary tumors raised in C57BL/6 mice
      have been shown to (i) contain a 4-hydroxycoumarin (warfarin)-sensitive cycle of 
      vitamin K metabolism which is at least qualitatively similar to that of liver,
      and (ii) catalyze the incorporation of NaH14 CO3 into endogenous protein in a
      vitamin-K hydroquinone-dependent reaction to produce gamma-carboxyglutamate. As
      in liver microsomes, LL microsomal reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin 
      K was greatly enhanced by exogenous dithiols such as dithiothreitol, but under
      identical conditions the former was 10-fold faster. The R(+) and S(-) warfarin
      enantiomers were highly and equally effective inhibitors of both the liver and
      tumor vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductases-the average I50 against the tumor enzyme
      was 0.25 microM. Partially purified reductases isolated by centrifugation of
      sodium-cholate-treated liver and LL tumor microsomes over a discontinuous sucrose
      gradient were also inhibited by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide following
      their reduction by dithiothreitol. Like the activity of the epoxide reductase,
      that of the gamma-carboxylase was much lower in tumor than in liver microsomes
      and was only detectable in microsomes isolated from tumor-bearing mice previously
      administered S(-) warfarin. In view of the reported inhibition of LL tumor
      metastasis by warfarin and diet-induced vitamin-K deficiency, vitamin-K-dependent
      proteins may play a role in the spread and/or subsequent growth of LL cells.

TI  - Non-contraceptive oestrogens and the risk of breast cancer in women.
PG  - 853-8
AB  - The relationship between use of non-contraceptive oestrogens and risk of breast
      cancer was investigated using data from a hospital-based case-control study from 
      Northern Italy. This study covered 1,108 patients with histologically confirmed
      breast cancers and 1,281 control subjects with a large spectrum of acute
      conditions unrelated to any of the known or suspected risk factors for breast
      cancer. Compared with "never-users", the age-adjusted relative risk for
      "ever-users" was 1.93 (95% confidence interval = 1.35-2.75). The risk increased
      with duration of use (relative risk = 2.08 for over 2 years), but was unrelated
      to time elapsed since first or last use. Allowance for a large number of
      identified potential confounding factors, including indicators of socio-economic 
      status and the major determinants of breast cancer risk, failed to account for
      the observed association (multivariate relative risk = 1.84 for ever use and 2.04
      for greater than 2 year use). Possible explanations for these findings and for
      their apparent discrepancy with some American data are discussed in terms of
      different baseline incidence of breast cancer in the two populations, and hence
      of potential baseline differences in availability of endogenous serum oestrogens.
      Nonetheless, the results of this study should be interpreted cautiously and
      viewed as a further contribution to a topic still open to debate.

TI  - Evaluation of a mass screening program for stomach cancer with a case-control
      study design.
PG  - 829-33
AB  - In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a mass screening program for stomach
      cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Nose town in Osaka, Japan. The case
      series consisted of all deaths from stomach cancer during the period 1969-1981
      (54 in males and 37 in females). For each case, 3 controls of the same sex and
      from the same precinct as the case, and born within 5 years of the case
      birth-year, were selected at random from Nose town residents alive at the date of
      death of the relevant case. We then investigated whether each case and
      corresponding controls had ever had screening tests before the date of diagnosis 
      of the case. From the matched analysis of the distribution of screening in
      case-control combination, the odds ratio of screened vs. unscreened among those
      who died from stomach cancer compared to those who did not was calculated as
      0.595 (90% confidence interval: 0.338-1.045) among males and 0.382 (0.185-0.785) 
      among females. When the screening tests conducted within 12 months of diagnosis
      were ignored on the presumption that they were symptom-related, the odds ratio
      was calculated as 0.519 (0.297-0.905) among males and 0.486 (0.239-0.986) among
      females. These data strongly suggest that the mass screening program is effective
      in reducing stomach cancer mortality.

TI  - Diet and breast cancer: a case-control study in Greece.
PG  - 815-20
AB  - A case-control study of the role of diet in the etiology of breast cancer was
      conducted in Athens, Greece. There are reasons to believe that the diet of the
      Greek population is characterized by greater heterogeneity than that in most
      countries where such studies have been undertaken. The case series consisted of
      120 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer admitted to 
      either of two teaching hospitals over a 12-month period. The controls were 120
      patients admitted to a teaching hospital for trauma and orthopedic conditions
      during the same period. Dietary histories concerning the frequency of consumption
      of 120 foods and drinks were obtained by interview. Cases reported significantly 
      less frequent consumption of vegetables as a group and, within that group,
      specifically of cucumber, lettuce and raw carrot. After adjustment for potential 
      external confounding variables and for confounding between food categories, the
      odds ratio for persons in the highest quintile of vegetable consumers, relative
      to those in the lowest quintile, was 0.09 with 95% confidence limits 0.03-0.30.
      That is to say, the lowest quintile of vegetable consumers had about 10 times the
      breast cancer risk of the highest quintile. For a score based on consumption of
      only the 3 specified salad items the odds ratio over the extreme quartiles was
      0.12 (0.05-0.32). There was no association with consumption of fats and oils,
      alcohol or coffee, and no significant association with any other major food
      category (including alcohol and coffee) after adjustment for confounding
      variables.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of methotrexate and its 7-OH metabolite in cancer patients
      treated with different high-methotrexate dosage regimens.
PG  - 795-800
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of methotrexate (MX) and 7-OH methotrexate (MXOH) was
      studied in 18 cancer patients treated with 6-hr intravenous (i.v.) infusion of
      100 mg/kg (A), 80 mg/kg preceded by 20 mg/kg i.v. loading dose (B), and 70 mg/kg 
      preceded by 30 mg/kg i.v. loading dose (C). Simultaneous analysis of MX and MXOH 
      was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The data for MX
      conformed to a 2-compartment model with overall mean +/- SD for beta, k12, k21,
      and k13 of 0.225 +/- 0.196, 1.33 +/- 1.44, 0.954 +/- 1.06, and 0.994 +/- 1.28
      hr-1, respectively. The total body clearance, Vc, and V-beta were 0.123 +/- 0.037
      l/hr.kg, 0.15 +/- 0.122 l/kg, and 0.965 +/- 0.875 l/kg, respectively. No
      significant differences (p greater than 0.05) in these parameters, attributable
      to the difference in regimens, were observed. With regimens A, B and C, the
      maximum observed concentrations of MXOH occurred at 9.2, 11.5, and 9.2 hr and the
      mean +/- SD values of these concentrations were 15.02 +/- 14, 18.96 +/- 13.63,
      14.91 +/- 9.95 microM, respectively. With regimens A and C, maximum observed
      concentrations of MX equal to 231 +/- 67.1 and 204 +/- 69.5 microM occurred at
      0.5 and 6 hr, respectively. Only with regimen B was a steady-state MX
      concentration of 179 microM achieved throughout infusion; this regimen is
      therefore highly advantageous for high-dose MX treatment.

TI  - Adenomatous polyps and atherosclerosis: an autopsy study of Japanese men in
      Hawaii.
PG  - 789-94
AB  - It is generally accepted that most colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous
      polyps and most coronary heart disease is caused by severe atherosclerosis. In
      order to compare the frequency of these disease precursors in men of Japanese
      ancestry in Hawaii, the degree of atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary
      arteries was estimated by the panel method in 288 male autopsy subjects. The
      extent of atherosclerosis was then compared in men who did or did not have
      adenomatous polyps as determined at autopsy. The degree of atherosclerosis of the
      coronary arteries and aorta was positively and significantly related not only to 
      the presence of adenomatous polyps, but to their size, multiplicity, and degree
      of atypia as well. This study suggests that shared environmental events could
      account for the development of severe atherosclerosis and adenomatous polyps. At 
      the same time, it has been observed that hawaii Japanese men experience colon and
      rectal cancer rates higher than those of US Whites, but their coronary heart
      disease (CHD) rates are intermediate between the low rates of Japan and the high 
      rates of the US white population. These differences in disease trends and
      differences in the serum cholesterol and fat intake of Hawaii Japanese men with
      CHD and colon cancer have suggested that men with these diseases represent
      different subsets of the westernized Japanese population. If CHD and colon cancer
      occur in different subsets of this population, they must stem from the
      accumulation of other risk factors superimposed upon the initiators of their
      precursor lesions.

AB  - The experiments described here show that radiolabelled formaldemethone is formed

TI  - The activated human met gene encodes a protein tyrosine kinase.
PG  - 357-61
AB  - We have raised antibodies against a synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to the 
      carboxyl terminus of the predicted met gene product. Phosphorylation of 60 kDa
      and 65 kDa proteins on tyrosine residues was observed when immunoprecipitates of 
      cells containing the activated human met gene were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP.
      Phosphoproteins with the same molecular masses could be immunoprecipitated from
      cells metabolically labelled with [32P]orthophosphate. When considered together, 
      these observations indicate that the activated human met gene encodes 60 kDa and 
      65 kDa proteins that can catalyse autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues.

TI  - N-terminal amino acid sequences of the heavy and light chains of chicken liver
      cathepsin L.
PG  - 330-4
AB  - Avian cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) was first purified from chicken liver. The
      enzyme was composed of two polypeptides with Mr values of 28,000 (heavy chain)
      and 5000 (light chain). The two polypeptide chains of the enzyme were separated
      by gel filtration after cleavage of disulfide bonds. The N-terminal amino acid
      sequences of the heavy and light chains were (sequence in text) and (sequence in 
      text) respectively. These sequences show high homologies with those of the
      N-terminal and C-terminal portions of papain, respectively. The residues of the
      surrounding area of cysteine-25 in the heavy chain were quite similar to those in
      the region around the active-site cysteine of papain.

PG  - 321-4
AB  - A new chloroperoxidase could be detected in Pseudomonas pyrrocinia ATCC 15,958, a
      bacterium that produces the antifungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin. This enzyme was
      separated from a ferriprotoporphyrin IX containing bromoperoxidase which was also
      produced by this bacterium. The enzyme is capable of catalyzing the chorination
      of indole to 7-chloroindole. This procaryotic chloroperoxidase requires the
      presence of H2O2 and can also brominate monochlorodimedone, but cannot catalyze
      its chlorination. This enzyme is the first chloroperoxidase described from
      procaryotic sources.

TI  - Heterogeneity of adrenocortical ferredoxin.
PG  - 311-5
AB  - Bovine adrenocortical ferredoxin (adreno-ferredoxin) was purified from
      adrenocortical mitochondria by an improved method that included hydrophobic
      chromatography on Toyopearl gels. The purified ferredoxin was electrophoretically
      homogeneous. It was further separated into five fractions by hydrophobic
      chromatography on a TSK-gel phenyl-5PW column with a high-pressure liquid
      chromatography system. The properties of the three main fractions were examined. 
      The fractions had identical absorption spectra and almost the same activity in an
      NADPH-cytochrome c reducing system. Their amino-terminal sequences all
      corresponded to the reported sequence, but the carboxyl-terminal residues were
      glycine or serine, not alanine as reported. These results indicate that these
      adreno-ferredoxins had additional amino acid residues at the carboxyl end. It
      seems that adreno-ferredoxin extracted from mitochondria undergoes proteolytic
      attack during purification to become heterogeneous.

TI  - Restoration of hydroperoxide-dependent lipid peroxidation by 3-methylcholanthrene
      induction of cytochrome P-448 in hepatoma microsomes.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - Microsomal membranes from the slow-growing Morris hepatoma 9618A catalyze, in the
      presence of t-butyl hydroperoxide, lower rates of lipid peroxidation than rat
      liver microsomes. The cytochrome P-450 content of hepatoma microsomes is about
      40% that of the liver. SKF 525-A, an inhibitor of mixed-function oxidase,
      produces in hepatoma microsomes a P-450 type I binding spectrum similar to that
      of hepatic microsomes. The concentration of the inhibitor required for
      half-maximal spectral change is about 2 microM in both microsome types. SKF 525-A
      or ethylmorphine inhibit lipid peroxidation of normal and tumor microsomes to the
      same extent (about 60%). Treatment of the tumor-bearing rats with
      3-methylcholanthrene increases the hepatoma cytochrome P-450 to values comparable
      to those of control membranes, although the hemoprotein has a peak in the
      CO-reduced difference absorption spectrum at 448 nm. The cytochrome P-448
      induction is accompanied by an almost complete restoration of the
      hydroperoxide-dependent lipid peroxidation.

TI  - Kurloff cell proteoglycans. Evidence for de novo synthesis of chondroitin
      sulphate proteoglycans by purified Kurloff cells.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - This paper reports the first direct demonstration of de novo synthesis of
      chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans by Kurloff cells. This was achieved using
      highly purified splenic Kurloff cells labelled in vitro with [35S]sulphate and
      D-[U-3H]glucosamine. A single population of sulphated proteoglycans was observed 
      after dissociative extraction, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Sepharose CL 6B
      chromatography and fluorography after electrophoresis. These were large, highly
      anionic proteoglycans and were completely digested by chondroitinase AC or ABC.
      Moreover, glycosaminoglycan extracted from Kurloff cells had the electrophoretic 
      mobility of control chondroitin sulphate.

TI  - 1H-NMR analysis of the sugar structures of glycoproteins as their pyridylamino
      derivatives.
PG  - 265-8
AB  - The 1H-NMR spectra of a series of pyridylamino (PA-) derivatives of
      oligosaccharides were obtained and compared with those of the corresponding
      asparagine-linked sugar chains in order to elucidate the effect of the PA-group
      on the chemical shifts of structural-reporter signals. The effects were found to 
      be localized within the two residues from the end group. Thus, the data for
      asparagine-linked chains in the literature are applicable to PA-derivatives, so
      the combination of pyridylamination and NMR measurements greatly reduces the time
      required for structure analysis of sugar chains of glycoproteins, because the
      isolation and purification of the chains as PA-derivatives are easy and
      efficient.

TI  - Effect of electrostatic repulsion on the morphology and thermotropic transitions 
      of anionic phospholipids.
PG  - 257-60
AB  - Samples of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol and dimyristoylphosphatidylserine
      which exhibit highly cooperative phase transitions in suspension with 0.5 M NaCl,
      10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, demonstrate a marked broadening of the phase
      transition when suspended in distilled water at pH 7. The cooperativity of the
      thermal transition of dimyristoylphosphatidic acid at pH 7.0, in contrast, was
      little affected by the presence or absence of 0.5 M NaCl. The most dramatic
      changes in phase transition properties were observed with phosphatidylglycerol.
      The morphology of phosphatidylglycerol was also altered by NaCl. At high salt
      concentrations, typical multilamellar structures were observed by freeze-fracture
      electron microscopy. However, in distilled water the large multilamellar
      structures are disrupted, with opened shells and smaller particles of 20-30 nm
      diameter being observed, in addition to a few larger vesicles. Structures of
      differing morphology could be partially separated from aqueous 'solutions' of
      phosphatidylglycerol by ultracentrifugation. The supernate contained only small
      particles. The results are discussed in terms of the large effective head group
      volume resulting from strong electrostatic repulsion at low ionic strengths. This
      allows the anionic lipids, particularly phosphatidylglycerol, to form hydrophilic
      surfaces with high curvature so as to seal the bilayer edges of discs or shells. 
      Thus, certain anionic lipids in distilled water destabilize bilayers by a
      mechanism which is opposite to that found with lipids which destabilize bilayers 
      by forming the hexagonal phase.

      2,6-bisphosphate at levels (0.5 nmol/10(9) cells) similar to those of

      levels of both fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate are much
      lower. They begin to increase at hatching and reach the levels in chicken in a
      few days.

      acetylcholinesterase. Comparison with bovine acetylcholinesterase.
PG  - 206-12
AB  - We have determined partial N-terminal sequences of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
      catalytic subunits from Torpedo marmorata electric organs and from bovine caudate
      nucleus. We obtain identical sequences (23 amino acids) for the soluble
      ('low-salt-soluble' or LSS fraction) and particulate ('detergent-soluble', or DS 
      fraction) amphiphilic dimers (G2 form) and for the asymmetric, collagen-tailed
      forms ('high-salt-soluble', or HSS fraction, A12 + A8 forms). There are two amino
      acid differences, at position 3 (Asp/His) and 20 (Ile/Val), with the sequences
      obtained for T. californica by MacPhee-Quigley et al. [(1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260,
      12185-12189] for the soluble G2 form and the lytic G4 form which is derived from 
      asymmetric AChE. The bovine sequence (12 amino acids) presents an identity of 4
      amino acids (Glu-Leu-Leu-Val) with that of Torpedo, at positions 5-8 (Torpedo)
      and 7-10 (bovine). There is also a clear homology with the sequence of human
      butyrylcholinesterase [(1986) Lockridge et al. J. Biol. Chem., in press]
      indicating that these enzymes probably derive from a common ancestor.

TI  - Loss of quin 2 accompanies degranulation of mast cells.
PG  - 169-74
AB  - Stimulation of quin 2 loaded mast cells in the presence of 1 mM extracellular
      calcium produced a rapid and sustained increase in quin 2 fluorescence. This was 
      accompanied by degranulation and the release of histamine. When Ca was replaced
      by EGTA or when Mn was present, a decrease in fluorescence accompanied
      degranulation. The increase in quin 2 fluorescence accompanying stimulation of
      mast cells appears to be due to the interaction of extracellular Ca with quin 2
      associated with the secretory granule matrix released upon exocytosis.

      protein kinase.
PG  - 162-4
AB  - The specificity of the heme-regulated protein kinase (HRI) was investigated
      further by utilizing the isolated 38,000 Da subunit (alpha subunit) polypeptide
      of eIF-2 as the substrate. For this purpose, the three subunit polypeptides of
      eIF-2 (38,000 Da, alpha; 50,000 Da, beta; and 52,000 Da, gamma) were resolved by 
      reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results show that
      HRI is incapable of phosphorylating the 38,000 Da subunit separated from the
      other two eIF-2 polypeptides. Data suggest that the substrate specificity of HRI 
      is determined by the quaternary structure assumed by the alpha subunit in
      association with the other two subunits in the eIF-2 holoprotein.

TI  - Characterization of the carbohydrate moiety of Clerodendron trichotomum lectins.

PG  - 779-85
AB  - Lectins were isolated from fruits and leaves of Clerodendron trichotomum by
      affinity chromatography on lactamyl-Sepharose. The purified lectins (C.
      trichotomum agglutinin: CTA) were homogeneous on SDS/polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis, and the carbohydrate moiety was characterized by physicochemical
      and immunochemical methods. The asparagine-linked oligosaccharides were released 
      by treatment with N-oligosaccharide glycopeptidase (almond, EC 3.5.1.52) of
      peptic glycopeptides obtained from fruit CTA, and separated by gel filtration and
      thin-layer chromatography. The structure of the predominant oligosaccharide was
      determined as Xyl beta 1----2 (Man alpha 1----6)(Man alpha 1----3)Man beta
      1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc by high-performance liquid
      chromatography, sugar analysis and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The reactivity of the
      carbohydrate moiety of CTA toward various lectins was studied. Fruit and leaf
      CTAs were applied to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to
      nitrocellulose sheets and detected with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated
      lectins. Concanavalin A, lentil lectin, pea lectin, Vicia faba lectin and Ulex
      europeus agglutinin I, but not wheat germ lectin, bound to fruit CTA. The results
      indicate new binding properties of these plant lectins: a beta-xylosyl residue
      substituted at C-2 of the beta-mannosyl residue of N-linked oligosaccharide does 
      not affect the binding with mannose-specific lectins, lentil, pea and Vicia faba 
      lectins can bind to N-linked oligosaccharides containing an alpha-L-fucosyl
      residue attached to C-3 of the asparagine-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue, 
      and Ulex europeus agglutinin I can bind to the (alpha 1----3)-linked fucose
      residue of the N-linked oligosaccharide.

TI  - Properties of the complexes of riboflavin 3',5'-bisphosphate and the
      apoflavodoxins from Megasphaera elsdenii and Desulfovibrio vulgaris.
PG  - 749-56
AB  - Megasphaera elsdenii and Desulfovibrio vulgaris apoflavodoxins have been
      reconstituted with riboflavin 3',5'-bisphosphate. Several biochemical and
      biophysical properties of the complexes have been investigated and the results
      are compared with the properties of the native proteins. The dissociation
      constant of the modified complex of M. elsdenii flavodoxin is increased by a
      factor of about 23 by comparison with that of the native protein. The rate
      constant for the formation of the complex of M. elsdenii flavodoxin is about 26
      times lower than that for the native protein. The redox potential of the
      transition between the oxidized and semiquinone state is similar to that of the
      native protein. On the other hand, the redox potential of the
      semiquinone-hydroquinone transition is about 20 mV more negative than that of the
      native protein. Absorbance and circular dichroic spectra of the protein-bound
      artificial prosthetic group and the protein-bound natural prosthetic group are
      very similar. In both the oxidized and in the fully reduced state only minor
      differences in interaction between the isoalloxazine ring and the apoprotein for 
      the two flavin derivatives are found by 13C and 15N NMR. 31P-NMR studies show
      that the 5'-phosphate group of the two flavin derivatives is bound in the same
      way and that it is dianionic in the complex. In contrast, the 3'-phosphate group 
      in riboflavin 3',5'-bisphosphate is monoanionic or even neutral when bound to the
      protein. The 3'-phosphate group is also close to or on the surface of the
      protein. Desulfovibrio vulgaris apoflavodoxin has an affinity for riboflavin
      3',5'-bisphosphate which is 10 times higher as compared to Megasphaera elsdenii
      apoflavodoxin (Ka = 10(8) M-1). Also the association rate constant of
      Desulfovibrio vulgaris apoprotein and riboflavin 3'5'-bisphosphate is found to be
      10 times faster than for the Megasphaera elsdenii flavodoxin reaction. The
      dissociation behaviour of native Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin measured under
      identical conditions as for the riboflavin 3',5'-bisphosphate analog gives a
      value (Kd approximately equal to 0.2 nM) which is considerably lower than
      reported earlier [Dubourdieu, M., MacKnight, M. L. & Tollin, G. (1974) Biochem.
      Biophys. Res. Commun. 60, 649-655]. The results are discussed in the light of the
      existing crystallographic data of flavodoxins and the recently proposed theory on
      the regulation of the redox potential in flavoproteins [Moonen, C. T. W.,
      Vervoort, J. & Muller, F. (1984) in Flavins and flavoproteins, pp. 493-496,

TI  - Intracellular pathway followed by invertase endocytosed by rat liver.
PG  - 695-700
AB  - Yeast invertase, when injected into rats, is endocytosed by the liver, mainly by 
      sinusoidal cells. The work reported here aims at investigating the organelles
      involved in the intracellular journey of this protein. Experiments were performed
      on rats injected with 125I-invertase (25 micrograms/100 g body wt) and killed at 
      various times after injection. Homogenates were fractioned by differential
      centrifugation, according to de Duve, Pressman, Gianetto, Wattiaux and Appelmans 
      [(1955) Biochem. J. 63, 604-617]. Early after injection the radioactivity was
      recovered mainly in the microsomal fraction P; later it was found in the
      mitochondrial fractions (ML). At all times a peak of relative specific activity
      was observed in the light mitochondrial fraction L. After isopycnic
      centrifugation in a sucrose gradient, structures bearing 125I-invertase, present 
      in P, exhibited a relatively flattened distribution with a density of around 1.17
      g/ml, relatively similar to that of alkaline phosphodiesterase a plasma membrane 
      marker. The organelles located in ML were endowed with a more homogeneous
      distribution, their median equilibrium density increasing up to 30 min after
      injection (1.20 g/ml----1.23 g/ml); with time the radioactivity distribution
      became more closely related to the distribution of arylsulfatase, a lysosomal
      enzyme. ML fractions, isolated 10 min and 180 min after 125I-invertase injection,
      were subjected to isopycnic centrifugation in Percoll gradient with, as solvent, 
      0.25 M, 0.5 M and 0.75 M sucrose. The change of density of the particles bearing 
      125I-invertase, as a function of the sucrose concentration, paralleled the change
      of density of the lysosomes as ascertained by the behaviour of arylsulfatase. The
      distribution of radioactivity and arylsulfatase in a sucrose gradient was
      established after isopycnic centrifugation of the ML fraction of rats injected
      with 125I-invertase, the animals having received or not an injection of 900
      micrograms/100 g body weight of unlabelled invertase 15 h before killing. In
      agreement with our previous results, a shift towards higher densities of about
      25% or arylsulfatase takes place in rats pretreated with unlabelled invertase. At
      10 min, invertase preinjection did not change the radioactivity distribution
      curve. Later, it caused a progressive shift of the distribution towards
      higher-density regions of the gradient where the arylsulfatase, which had been
      shifted, was located.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Starvation of the mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa for an essential amino acid (Trp,
      His, Leu, Ile or Phe) stimulated the incorporation of [3H]adenosine as ADP-ribose
      monomer into an 80,000-Mr protein, P80. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of Hepa
      proteins showed that P80 was the only protein labeled under starvation
      conditions. Time course experiments showed that the ADP-ribosylation of P80 was a
      consequence rather than the cause of reduced translational activity.
      Cycloheximide treatment and incubation at reduced temperatures also reduced the
      rate of protein synthesis and stimulated the ADP-ribosylation of P80.
      Starvation-dependent ADP-ribosylation of P80 was shown to occur in three other
      cell lines (Chang, Neuro-2a, and chick comb fibroblasts).

PG  - 621-7
AB  - Competition between adenosine(5')tetraphospho(5')adenosine (Ap4A) and DNA for the
      synthesis of adducts with the cis or trans isomer of diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
      was measured in the presence and absence of magnesium and spermidinium ions.
      Reaction products were analysed by circular dichroism, poly(ethyleneimine)
      thin-layer chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. Competition was
      affected by the oligovalent cations that bound specifically to the dinucleotide. 
      Platination of DNA was favoured under all conditions. Chromatin was less
      competitive. The mechanism was kinetic competition, DNA reacting considerably
      faster than Ap4A. Platinum(II) did not exchange between adducts and free DNA and 
      Ap4A, respectively. On that basis only low amounts of Ap4A adducts were estimated
      to be formed under conditions of clinical chemotherapy. The cis and trans isomers
      of diamminedichloroplatinum(II) were equally effective. Platinum(II) adducts of
      Ap4A were neither degraded by Ap4A-specific pyrophosphohydrolases nor by
      phosphodiesterase nor in the presence of unfractionated extract of calf thymus.
      Unphysiologically high concentrations of Crotalus durissus phosphodiesterase I
      were required for hydrolytic splitting, the amount of which was similar for both 
      platinum(II) isomer adducts. The results suggest that Ap4A platinum(II) adducts
      might accumulate during chemotherapy of cancer treatment.

PG  - 595-601
AB  - The kinetics of cadmium and terbium dissociation from bovine testis calmodulin
      and its tryptic fragments have been studied by stopped-flow fluorescence methods,
      using the calcium indicator Quin 2. Studies of the tryptic fragments TR1C and
      TR2C, comprising the N-terminal or C-terminal half of calmodulin, have clearly
      identified cadmium binding sites I and II as the low-affinity (rapidly
      dissociating) sites and sites III and IV as the high-affinity (slowly
      dissociating) sites. Thus the site preference of cadmium is the same as that of
      calcium. For terbium, however, sites I and II are the high-affinity sites and
      sites III and IV are the low-affinity sites. Thus, the site preference or terbium
      is not the same as that of calcium and cadmium. In contrast to previous studies
      with calcium, we observe two kinetic processes for dissociation from sites III
      and IV for experiments with both cadmium and terbium. Possible models for the
      binding of metal ions are discussed.

PG  - 589-94
AB  - A study of the equilibrium binding of glycoproteins to lectins was undertaken
      using the titled compounds as a model system for such interactions. The binding
      of hen ovalbumin, enriched in galactose specifically 13C-labelled at C1, to
      Erythrina cristagalli agglutinin was studied by 13C-NMR spectroscopy. The lectin 
      was shown to be bivalent for ovalbumin with an apparent estimated association
      constant, at infinite dilution, of about 10(4) M-1. The observed association is
      similar to that found for the corresponding disaccharide, Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc.
      The results strongly suggest that only the N-acetyllactosamine moiety in the
      carbohydrate side chain of galactose-enriched ovalbumin participates in the
      binding to the lectin with little, if any, interactions from other parts of
      either the side chain or the polypeptide backbone of ovalbumin.

      biphasic systems. Thermolysin-catalyzed synthesis of
      N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester.
PG  - 541-9
AB  - We studied kinetics and the equilibrium relationship for the
      thermolysin-catalyzed synthesis of
      N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (Z-Asp-PheOMe) from
      N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-aspartic acid (Z-Asp) and L-phenylalanine methyl ester
      (PheOMe) in an aqueous-organic biphasic system. This is a model reaction giving a
      condensation product with dissociating groups. The kinetics for the synthesis of 
      Z-Asp-PheOMe in aqueous solution saturated with ethyl acetate was expressed by a 
      rate equation for the rapid-equilibrium random bireactant mechanism, and the
      reverse hydrolysis reaction was zero-order with respect to Z-Asp-PheOMe
      concentration. The courses of synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe in the biphasic system
      were well explained, by the rate equations obtained for the aqueous solution and 
      by the partition of substrate and condensation product between the both phases.
      The rate of synthesis in the biphasic system was much lower than in aqueous
      solution due to the unfavorable partition of PheOMe in the aqueous phase. The
      equation for the equilibrium yield of Z-Asp-PheOMe in the biphasic system was
      derived assuming that only the non-ionized forms of the substrate and
      condensation product exist in the organic phase. It was found theoretically and
      experimentally that the yield of Z-Asp-PheOMe is maximum at the aqueous-phase pH 
      of around 5, lower than for synthesis in aqueous solution. The effect of the
      organic solvent on the rate and equilibrium for the synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe
      could be explained by the variation in the partition coefficient. The effect of
      the partitioning of substrate on the aqueous-phase pH change was also shown.

      Thermolysin-catalyzed synthesis of

PG  - 533-40
AB  - We studied kinetics of thermolysin-catalyzed peptide synthesis in an
      aqueous/organic biphasic system theoretically and experimentally. As a model
      reaction producing a condensation product having no dissociating groups, we used 
      the synthesis of N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanine methyl
      ester (Z-Phe2OMe) from N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-phenylalanine (Z-Phe) and
      L-phenylalanine methyl ester (PheOMe). Usually, ethyl acetate was used as the
      organic solvent. First we studied the kinetics of the synthesis of Z-Phe2OMe in a
      buffer solution saturated with ethyl acetate. Then, factors that may affect the
      kinetics in the biphasic system were examined. The course of Z-Phe2OMe synthesis 
      in the biphasic system was explained by the rate equations obtained, using the
      partitions of substrate and product and non-enzymatic decomposition of PheOMe. In
      the biphasic reaction system, the rate of synthesis was lower for a wide range of
      pH due to the unfavorable partition of PheOMe in the aqueous phase, but yields
      were higher than in the buffer solution. The effects of the organic solvents on
      the rate of synthesis could also be explained by variations in the partition
      coefficient of PheOMe. Finally, we gave a way to predict the aqueous-phase pH
      change caused by partitioning of the substrate. The significance of the pH change
      was shown in connection with the reaction using the immobilized enzyme in an
      organic solvent.

TI  - Protection against paraquat-induced injury by exogenous GSH in pulmonary alveolar
      type II cells.
PG  - 4537-42
AB  - Exogenous GSH provided rat alveolar type II cells with significant protection
      against injury induced by paraquat. This protection was also observed in cells
      treated with acivicin to inhibit GSH degradation and buthionine sulfoximine to
      inhibit GSH synthesis. Exogenous GSH was transported into cells by a
      Na+-dependent system. Addition of inhibitors of this transport system,
      gamma-glutamyl-glutamate and probenecid, prevented the protection against injury 
      afforded by GSH. Thus, the results indicate that alveolar type II cells can
      supplement endogenous synthesis of GSH with uptake of exogenous GSH to protect
      against paraquat-induced injury.

TI  - 3-Deazaneplanocin A: a new inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine synthesis and its 
      effects in human colon carcinoma cells.
PG  - 4523-7
AB  - The mechanism of action of the cyclopentenyl analogue of 3-deazaadenosine
      (3-deazaneplanocin A or c3Nep) was investigated in the human colon carcinoma cell
      line HT-29. Upon exposure of cells for 24 hr to 3-deazaneplanocin A (c3Nep),
      neplanocin A (Nep) or 3-deazaaristeromycin (c3Ari), significant toxicity was
      noted only for Nep, wherein an 87% reduction in viability was produced at a 100
      microM concentration. c3Nep and c3Ari at 100 microM reduced viability by 34 and
      21%, respectively. Intracellular levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) were
      elevated by a 24-hr exposure to 100 microM c3Nep, Nep and c3Ari and were 120, 75 
      and 25 pmoles/10(6) cells respectively. Only Nep was metabolized to an
      S-adenosylmethionine-like metabolite, and its formation was dose-related to its
      cytotoxicity. The t1/2 for the disappearance of elevated levels of AdoHcy
      following drug removal was 1.6 to 2.5 hr for all drugs. rRNA and tRNA methylation
      was inhibited significantly by Nep, but c3Nep and c3Ari inhibited tRNA
      methylation but not rRNA methylation to a lesser degree. These results
      demonstrate that c3Nep is a potent inhibitor of AdoHcy synthesis with a low
      degree of cytotoxicity.

TI  - Effects of three H2 antagonists on the isolated perfused rat liver. Correlation
      of bile flow changes with potential for causing hepatic disease in patients.
PG  - 4519-22
AB  - The adverse effects of oxmetidine, an H2 blocking agent which has been shown to
      produce hepatic injury in 1-4% of patients, on an in vitro model were compared
      with those of cimetidine and ranitidine which have led to only rare instances of 
      hepatic injury. Bile flow was measured in the isolated perfused rat liver (Wistar
      rats), comparing the effects of each of the three drugs with control perfusions. 
      Oxmetidine in concentrations of 3 X 10(-3) M or greater led to a decrease in bile
      flow within 15 min and, at a concentration of 5 X 10(-3) M, to complete cessation
      of flow within 5 min. Lower concentrations (5 X 10(-4) M) led to a marked
      choleresis. Ranitidine and cimetidine in concentrations up to 5 X 10(-3) M
      produced no decrease in bile flow. Ranitidine, however, led to a choleresis at a 
      concentration of 5 X 10(-3) M. The positive correlation between in vivo and in
      vitro toxicity supports the view that in vitro testing may prove to be of use in 
      predicting the hepatotoxic potential of a drug.

PG  - 4493-7
AB  - The novel bicyclic compound Wy-45,030
      [1-2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl cyclohexanol, hydrochloride]
      exhibited a neurochemical profile predictive of antidepressant activity. Like the
      tricyclic antidepressants, it inhibited rat brain imipramine receptor binding and
      synaptosomal monoamine uptake (dopamine as well as norepinephrine and serotonin).
      It did not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, it
      was not antimuscarinic in the guinea pig ileum, nor did it have any appreciable
      affinity for brain alpha-1 adrenergic or histamine-1 binding sites. Wy-45,030 was
      also without affinity for alpha-2 or beta adrenergic, benzodiazepine,
      serotonin-1, serotonin-2, dopamine-2, and opiate receptors. Such a profile is
      predictive of antidepressant activity devoid of the side-effects common to
      tricyclic therapy.

TI  - Catalase-dependent ethanol metabolism in vivo in deermice lacking alcohol
      dehydrogenase.
PG  - 4487-92
AB  - Pathways of ethanol elimination in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-positive and
      -negative deermice were studied using the catalase inhibitor,
      3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. To verify that aminotriazole inhibited catalase
      effectively, the characteristic decrease in catalase-H2O2 which occurs in
      saline-treated controls when ethanol is peroxidized was monitored at 660-640 nm
      in perfused deermouse livers. Following 1.5 hr of pretreatment with aminotriazole
      (1.5 g/kg), the peroxidatic activity of catalase measured in vitro was inhibited 
      by greater than 99%. Under these conditions, ethanol did not decrease
      catalase-H2O2 in perfused livers, indicating that catalase was inhibited. Ethanol
      and aniline oxidation by microsomes were also inhibited by about 67-90% after 1.5
      hr of pretreatment with aminotriazole. In ADH-positive deermice, pretreatment
      with aminotriazole for 1.5 hr prior to injection of ethanol (2.0 g/kg) decreased 
      rates of ethanol elimination in vivo from 13.2 +/- 0.8 to 10.2 +/- 0.4
      mmoles/kg/hr. In ADH-negative deermice, similar treatment decreased rates of
      ethanol elimination in vivo from 4.5 +/- 0.4 to 1.1 +/- 0.6 mmoles/kg/hr.
      Following pretreatment with aminotriazole (1.0 g/kg) for 6 hr, rates of ethanol
      elimination in ADH-negative deermice returned to near basal values. Under these
      conditions, the peroxidatic activity of catalase measured in vitro and the
      ethanol-dependent decrease in catalase-H2O2 in perfused livers also returned to
      near basal levels; however, the oxidation of ethanol by cytochrome P-450 was
      inhibited completely. It is concluded, therefore, that time of pretreatment with 
      aminotriazole is an important variable which must be controlled carefully to
      inhibit catalase completely. Since catalase was active while cytochrome P-450 was
      not following 6 hr of pretreatment with aminotriazole, it is concluded that
      ethanol elimination occurs predominantly via catalase-H2O2 in ADH-negative
      deermice under these conditions.

TI  - Determination of monoamine oxidase concentrations in rat liver by inhibitor
      binding.
PG  - 4467-72
AB  - The concentrations of monoamine oxidase-A and -B have been determined in
      mitochondria, mitochondrial outer membranes and microsomes from Sprague-Dawley
      and Wistar rats by determining the binding of tritium-labelled pargyline.
      Although the amounts of each form present depended on the source and the
      preparation method, this was paralleled by the specific activity such that the
      molecular turnover number was found to remain constant. The catalytic constants, 
      kcat/Km, which represents the apparent second-order rate constant for the
      combination of enzyme and substrate, were about 0.13 and 2.1 sec-1 X microM-1 for
      5-hydroxytryptamine and 2-phenethylamine, respectively, regardless of the source.
      Estimations of the amounts of the two forms by determining the concentrations of 
      the inhibitors clorgyline, (-)-deprenyl, J-508 or pargyline necessary to give
      complete inhibition were shown to give overestimates of the true values because
      of the non-specific binding of these inhibitors to sites other than the monoamine
      oxidase active site.

TI  - Inhibition of protein kinase C mediated signal transduction by tamoxifen.
      Importance for antitumour activity.
PG  - 4463-5
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated tamoxifen inhibition of the enzyme protein
      kinase C (PKC) in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 
      tamoxifen on PKC function in intact human cells. As PKC activates the neutrophil 
      oxidase mechanism the neutrophil was chosen as an experimental model to assess
      PKC-tamoxifen interaction in these experiments. Neutrophils from healthy
      volunteers were separated by centrifugation through Ficoll Hypaque. Two separate 
      parameters of oxidase activation; oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen
      metabolite production were monitored by a Clark electrode chamber and luminol
      dependent chemiluminescence respectively. Neutrophil chemiluminescence was
      markedly stimulated by 4 Phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA). This stimulation 
      was inhibited by tamoxifen; IC50 = 6.1 +/- 1.6 microM (means +/- S.E.M.) N = 6.
      Neutrophil oxygen consumption was similarly stimulated by PMA and inhibited by
      tamoxifen. The tamoxifen inhibition was not due to cell toxicity as assessment of
      cell integrity by the exclusion of trypan blue and measurement of intracellular
      concentrations of ATP showed no significant differences before and after
      treatment. Tamoxifen also inhibited neutrophil chemiluminescence which was
      stimulated by oleoyl acetyl glycerol and mezerein excluding interaction with PMA 
      as an explanation of its inhibitory effect. These results are consistent with
      tamoxifen inhibition of PKC function in intact human cells. This may be central
      to its antitumour action.

TI  - Association of hydrophobic substances with hemin. Characterization of the reverse
      type I binding spectrum and its relationship to cytochrome P-450.
PG  - 4443-8
AB  - When hydrophobic compounds were added to a solution of protoferriheme, a a
      reverse type I spectral change was produced when observed by difference
      spectroscopy. The spectrum had a peak at 422 nm and a trough at 387 nm, and the
      characteristics were dependent on the pH of the sample. An association constant
      for the complex could be determined and was also found to be pH sensitive, with
      the association constant dropping to zero at values below pH 7.0 and above pH
      8.5. The determination of the delta Absmax for the ethylbenzene-hemin complex at 
      various hemin concentrations indicates monomeric heme to be the species
      responsible for binding the hydrocarbon with the concomitant generation of the
      reverse type I spectral change.

      versus visceral yolk sac in vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 4437-41
AB  - L-Buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (L-BSO), a selective inhibitor of glutathione
      synthesis, exhibited the capacity to deplete embryonic and visceral yolk sac
      glutathione (GSH) after administration in vivo and also after addition of L-BSO
      to a whole embryo culture system. Administration of L-BSO to pregnant dams at 2.5
      or 18 hr prior to the explantation of day 10 conceptuses resulted in greater than
      55% GSH depletion relative to control values in both the yolk sac and the embryo 
      proper. The levels of GSH returned to normal in all embryos and in the
      corresponding visceral yolk sacs pretreated at 2.5 hr (but not at 18 hr) after
      culturing for 24 hr in L-BSO-free medium. GSH content was significantly lower in 
      yolk sacs but not in embryos of conceptuses cultured for 24 hr in medium
      containing 1 mM L-BSO. This treatment, however, significantly increased the
      amount of protein and DNA in the embryo. The differential sensitivity of the yolk
      sac versus embryo and the demonstration of the ability to modulate tissue levels 
      of GSH during organogenesis promise to provide important new tools for the study 
      of embryonic protective mechanisms in chemical teratogenesis.

TI  - Incorporation of cytochrome b5 into rat liver microsomal membranes. Impairment of
      cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed function oxidase activity.
PG  - 4431-6
AB  - Cytochrome b5 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the liver
      microsomes of untreated rats and reincorporated into liver microsomes from
      phenobarbital-treated rats, resulting in an approximate three-fold enrichment of 
      the cytochrome b5 specific content (1.5 nmol haemoprotein X mg-1 protein). Our
      results have shown that the N-demethylation of benzphetamine was progressively
      inhibited in cytochrome b5-fortified microsomal preparations. Using stopped flow,
      visible difference spectrophotometry, the NADPH-driven reduction kinetics of
      cytochrome P-450 were examined in the modified microsomes over the first few
      seconds of reaction. Increasing the amount of incorporated cytochrome b5 resulted
      in a progressive inhibition of the initial, fast phase reduction rate constant of
      microsomal cytochrome P-450, both in the absence and presence of the type I
      substrate benzphetamine. Although the initial rate of NADPH-driven cytochrome b5 
      reduction was the same for both native and cytochrome b5-fortified microsomes,
      the extent of cytochrome b5 reduction was greater in the fortified microsomes. If
      cytochrome b5 has a positive role to play in cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed
      function oxidase activity either as an effector or in electron transfer or both, 
      the former haemoprotein must be already present in sufficient concentrations in
      the native microsomes.

      2-amino-1-fluoro-3-phenylpropane hydrochloride (fluoroamphetamine, FAM) were

      Substitution of fluorine into the side-chain of AM increased the rate of
      elimination of drug from brain and modified the kinetics from a one- to a
      two-compartment model. Urinary excretion of unchanged S-(-)-FAM was reduced from 
      that observed after R-(-)-AM, suggesting a more extensive metabolism. Fluorine
      substitution also modified the behavioral response to AM. Thus, each optical
      isomer of FAM produced paradoxical reductions in locomotor activity and body
      temperature.

PG  - 4395-400
AB  - Calmodulin can be specifically acylated with a fluorene-containing hydrophobic
      spin-labeling reagent at just Lys 75 or at Lys 75 and Lys 148. The binding of
      trifluoperazine to calmodulin and the two adducts was determined using a
      Hummel-Dreyer procedure, and binding of the phenothiazine was found to be
      characterized by apparent positive cooperativity and an apparent limiting
      stoichiometry of about seven binding sites per protein molecule. Two non-reactive
      fluorene-containing compounds were synthesized, and both reagents exhibited far
      less binding to calmodulin than did trifluoperazine. One of these was also
      assayed for binding to the monolabeled adduct, and this binding was about half
      that observed with calmodulin and was non-cooperative. Thus, the qualitative and 
      quantitative binding parameters of hydrophobic groups to calmodulin can be quite 
      different.

TI  - Chain-shortening of a xenobiotic acyl compound by the peroxisomal beta-oxidation 
      system in rat liver.
PG  - 4363-8
AB  - When 14C-labeled N-(alpha-methylbenzyl)azelaamic acid (C9), which is an
      intermediate in the metabolism of N-(alpha-methylbenzyl)linoleamide, a potent
      hypocholesterolemic agent, was administered to rats, 84% of the radioactivity was
      recovered in the urine in 24 hr, which contained 66.1% of
      N-(alpha-methylbenzyl)glutaramic acid (C5) and 8.6% of
      N-(alpha-methylbenzyl)pimelamic acid (C7) as major metabolites. While 14C-labeled
      C9 was incubated with isolated hepatocytes, similar metabolites were found,
      whereas none of the metabolites with an even number of carbon atoms in the acyl
      side chain was detected. The activity of the chain-shortening of C9 by
      hepatocytes isolated from clofibrate-treated rats was stimulated to about twice
      that of untreated hepatocytes, in parallel with the elevation of C9-dependent
      H2O2-generation. A subcellular fractionation study of the liver revealed that the
      subcellular distribution of cyanide-insensitive C9-oxidation activity was
      coincident with that of catalase and of cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA
      oxidation. In this reaction, C7 and C5 were produced. For this reaction, the
      formation of C9-CoA thioester was essential as an intermediary step. These
      results indicate that peroxisomes are capable of shortening the acyl side-chains 
      of drugs by beta-oxidation and, thus, suggest an additional metabolic role for
      peroxisomes.

PG  - 771-8
AB  - We reviewed 57 consecutive biopsies of lesions of the caruncle seen in the Wills 
      Eye Hospital Pathology Department from 1977 through 1985. The types and relative 
      frequency of excised caruncular lesions were recorded and correlation of
      pathologic diagnosis with preoperative clinical diagnosis, age, and sex was made.
      Squamous papillomas accounted for 18 (32%) and nevi for 14 (24%) of all
      caruncular masses. Pyogenic granulomas accounted for five (9%), epithelial
      inclusion cysts for four (7%), chronic inflammation for four (7%), and
      oncocytomas for two (4%) of all caruncular masses. Of the 57 cases only three
      (5%) were malignant tumors.

TI  - Ocular neuromyotonia after radiation therapy.
PG  - 766-70
AB  - Ocular neuromyotonia is a paroxysmal monocular deviation that results from spasm 
      of eye muscles secondary to spontaneous discharges from third, fourth, or sixth
      nerve axons. We observed this rare disorder in four patients who had been treated
      with radiation for tumors in the region of the sella turcica and cavernous sinus.
      Based on these cases and four others identified in the literature it would appear
      that radiation predisposes to a cranial neuropathy in which ocular neuromyotonia 
      may be the major manifestation. Radiation appears to be the most common cause of 
      ocular neuromyotonia.

TI  - Open-angle glaucoma associated with vitreous humor filling the anterior chamber.
PG  - 759-61
AB  - We studied the diagnostic features of vitreous humor filling the anterior chamber
      in open-angle glaucoma in one patient who developed this phenomenon several years
      after an intracapsular cataract extraction. In two other patients, vitreous
      filled the anterior chamber after ocular trauma. These patients had markedly
      increased intraocular pressures that responded poorly to medical therapy.
      Follow-up of at least one year with each of our patients suggests that with
      vitrectomy they have done well.

TI  - Features of a syndrome with congenital cataract and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 740-9
AB  - We studied 12 patients from six unrelated families with a syndrome that has an
      autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and can be diagnosed from clinical,
      histologic, and biochemical characteristics. The four major symptoms are
      congenital cataract, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitochondrial myopathy of
      voluntary muscles, and exercise-related lactic acidosis. The patients had
      bilateral and total cataract in the first weeks of life, underwent cataract
      surgery, and developed nystagmus and strabismus. Corrected visual acuity was
      lower than 20/40 in aphakic eyes. Patients were mentally normal, and at school
      age they visited a school for blind and visually impaired children. The majority 
      of the patients developed axial myopia with myopic fundus changes; aphakic
      refraction usually was lower than 10.0 diopters after the first decade. The
      cardiac myopathy was progressive and the cause of premature death. Three of the
      12 patients died in the neonatal period and six patients died in early adulthood.

PG  - 727-32
AB  - I measured the spectral transmittance of 16 implantable intraocular lenses from
      12 manufacturers and examined the rationale for using ultraviolet-absorptive
      intraocular lenses to protect pseudophakic individuals from photic retinopathy.
      Each ultraviolet-protective lens was classified by the wavelength at which its
      spectral transmittance fell to 10% in the blue or ultraviolet region of the
      spectrum. Current ultraviolet-protective intraocular lenses differ in the
      effectiveness of their protection against photic retinopathy, and product
      descriptions may be misleading.

PG  - 717-22
AB  - We evaluated the use of transvitreal cyanoacrylate retinopexy in the treatment of
      experimental rhegmatogenous retinal detachment during vitreous surgery in rabbit 
      eyes filled with silicone oil. The view to the fundus was superior to that
      obtained in our previous model of cyanoacrylate retinopexy in the air-filled eye.
      Glue delivery was consequently both easier and more precise through silicone oil 
      relative to air. The chorioretinal adhesions produced with cyanoacrylate tissue
      adhesive were compared with those produced by transscleral retinal cryopexy and
      were found to be more rapid in onset as well as stronger. An exaggerated tissue
      response adjacent to the cyanoacrylate site suggested a potential toxic chemical 
      or thermal reaction, or both, to the tissue adhesive, but there was no evidence
      of any distant ocular effects.

TI  - Vitrectomy for advanced stages of retinopathy of prematurity.
PG  - 710-6
AB  - We did a retrospective review of the consecutive vitrectomies for traction
      retinal detachment associated with retinopathy of prematurity performed at our
      institution. Fifty-eight eyes were operated on in 46 patients at less than 1 year
      of age, including 12 eyes with partial retinal detachments and 46 eyes with total
      retinal detachments. Only patients with at least six months follow-up were
      considered for success. Twenty-five eyes (43%) were anatomically reattached.
      Factors associated with good anatomic outcome included greater mean preoperative 
      pupillary dilation, absence of posterior synechiae, deep anterior chamber,
      partial detachment or open-funnel total detachment configuration, and adequate
      posterior membrane removal. Of the 25 eyes with attached retinas, 11 had fixing
      and following visual acuities or better. Three eyes with attached retinas had no 
      light perception and 11 eyes with attached retinas had light perception only. To 
      maximize anatomic and functional results we emphasize the need to operate early, 
      when the retinal funnel is still open.

TI  - Demonstration of herpes group virus in acute retinal necrosis syndrome.
PG  - 701-9
AB  - Tissue for pathologic examination was obtained from three cases of acute retinal 
      necrosis syndrome. Virus particles belonging to the herpesvirus family were
      demonstrated in retinal biopsies from two patients, one of whom was
      immunosuppressed. Despite removal of large biopsy specimens, the retina has
      remained attached for 20 months postoperatively in one case and for three months 
      in the other. In a third patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the
      clinical course and postmortem immunopathology were suggestive of a herpes
      simplex virus infection, initially affecting the retina and subsequently the
      optic nerves, chiasm, tracts, and central nervous system. These cases illustrate 
      that the virus associated with the acute retinal necrosis syndrome is easily
      demonstrable using vitrectomy and endoretinal biopsy in the acute phase of the
      disease, but may be difficult to demonstrate in chronically detached atrophic
      retinas.

PG  - 693-700
AB  - The relationship between HLA-DR phenotype, refractive error, and risk of both
      nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy was studied among 227
      insulin-dependent diabetics participating in a case-control study of diabetic
      retinopathy. In the absence of myopia, risk of both proliferative and
      nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy was increased for HLA-DR phenotypes 4/0,
      3/0, and X/X (HLA susceptible) compared to HLA-DR phenotypes 3/4, 3/X, and 4/X
      (HLA nonsusceptible). Odds ratios equalled 11.8 and 7.4 respectively. In the
      presence of myopia this increased risk associated with HLA status was abolished. 
      Myopia decreased the risk of proliferative and nonproliferative diabetic
      retinopathy among HLA-susceptible individuals, odds ratio equalled .09 and .09,
      but had no protective influence among HLA-nonsusceptible individuals.

TI  - Bombesin in human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages.
PG  - 3928-32
AB  - Bombesin found in neuroepithelial bodies and oat cell carcinoma of the lung, is
      thought to play an important role in normally developing and malignant lung.
      Monocytes-macrophages and human small cell lung carcinoma cells share several
      features, including macrophage-specific surface markers and the expression of
      functional receptors for bombesin-like neuropeptides and growth factors. Because 
      small cell lung carcinoma cells synthesize immunoreactive bombesin, we
      investigated the possibility that alveolar macrophages also contain bombesin, a
      plausible hypothesis considering the many reports of neuropeptide production by
      immune cells and cells of bone marrow origin. Adherent human peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells as well as human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages were found
      to contain bombesin. The peptide was detected by radioimmunoassay,
      immunohistochemistry, high-pressure liquid chromatography with the use of
      different monospecific antibodies.

TI  - IgG antinuclear antibodies with cross-reactive rheumatoid factor activity.
PG  - 3796-801
AB  - To investigate whether IgG antinuclear antibodies have cross-reactive rheumatoid 
      factor activity, monoclonal IgG antibodies to DNA and Sm from autoimmune
      MRL-lpr/lpr mice were assayed by ELISA for binding to IgG antigens. Of the nine
      anti-DNA and anti-Sm monoclonals tested, six showed significant binding to
      affinity-purified rabbit IgG (RIgG) and human IgG (HIgG). To confirm that
      cross-reactivities were due to a single antibody, immunoabsorption of a
      representative polyspecific monoclonal termed C11 (anti-DNA, anti-Sm) on either
      Sepharose-DNA or Sepharose-RIgG resulted in marked loss of activity to the three 
      antigens DNA, Sm and RIgG compared with immunoabsorption on Sepharose-bovine
      serum albumin. The monomolecular nature of the cross-reacting antibody was also
      suggested by inhibition analysis of C11; DNA inhibited C11 binding to RIgG 64%,
      whereas Sm inhibited binding to RIgG 33%. Aggregated RIgG and HIgG, however, did 
      not inhibit binding of C11 to DNA, Sm, or solid-phase RIgG, probably reflecting
      the low affinity of this antibody for fluid phase Ig. Together, these findings
      suggest that antinuclear autoantibodies of the IgG, as well as the IgM, class
      have polyspecific IgG binding activity and suggest that IgG antinuclear
      antibodies may emerge from rheumatoid factor responses.

TI  - Anti-thyroglobulin anti-idiotypic antibodies in sera of patients with Hashimoto's
      thyroiditis and Graves' disease.
PG  - 3786-95
AB  - The objective of this study was to find naturally occurring anti-idiotypic
      (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of
      patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Sera from patients with Hashimoto's
      thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the
      presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies
      (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates
      were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on
      hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was
      detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific
      positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26
      patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal
      subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id
      antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive
      sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all
      anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id
      antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% 
      by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those 
      anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient
      3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG
      purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not
      the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb
      but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the
      conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the
      course of thyroid autoimmune disorders.

TI  - The NK-1.1(-) mouse: a model to study differentiation of murine NK cells.
PG  - 3742-7
AB  - The NK-1.1(-) mouse was constructed by weekly injections of monoclonal
      anti-NK-1.1 antibody from birth through adulthood. Spleen cells from these mice
      have decreased NK-1.1+ cells and null (Thy-1- and B220-) cells. Their splenic NK 
      activity to YAC targets was low and was not enhanced by IFN-alpha or IFN-beta.
      Bone marrow (BM) of these NK-1.1(-) mice have normal precursors to NK cells: 1)
      NK activity could be generated from NK-1.1(-) BM cells cultured in rIL 2 for 5 to
      6 days. These cultured BM cells expressed Qa-5, Thy-1, AsGm-1, and NK-1.1
      antigens. The precursor cells of these BM cytotoxic cells are NK-1.1-; 2)
      transfer of BM cells from the NK-1.1(-) mice reconstituted the NK activity of
      irradiated, NK-depleted recipients. Lymphokine-activated killer cells could also 
      be generated from spleens of these NK-1.1(-) mice. Therefore, the NK-1.1(-) mice 
      were specifically depleted of mature cytotoxic NK cells, but not the NK-1.1-
      precursors of NK cells. This mouse model is valuable to study ontogeny and
      physiologic relevance of NK cells.

      cultured fibroblasts.
PG  - 16775-80
AB  - Low density lipoprotein (LDL) internalization by mutant type C Niemann-Pick (NPC)
      fibroblasts results in uptake of excess total cholesterol. Uptake of excess
      lipoprotein cholesterol appears to be mediated by the specific LDL receptor
      pathway. Associated with excessive LDL-cholesterol uptake is a lesion in early
      intracellular cholesteryl ester synthesis. In vitro acylCoA:cholesterol
      acyltransferase activity is normal in cell-free extracts of mutant cells. The
      ability of exogenous sterols to enhance intracellular esterification of
      [3H]mevalonate-derived [3H]cholesterol was severely limited in mutant cell
      cultures suggesting that in vivo activation and/or expression of activated
      acylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase may be compromised by the primary mutation of
      type C Niemann-Pick disease. After 2 days of LDL uptake, rates of intracellular
      cholesteryl ester synthesis in mutant cells paralleled the rates of
      esterification in normal cells suggesting that specific early in vivo expression 
      of the acyltransferase may be affected in this disorder.

AB  - The esterification of cholesterol derived from human low density lipoprotein
      (LDL) or fetal bovine serum (FBS) was deficient in cultured fibroblasts from
      subjects with heterozygous and homozygous type C Niemann-Pick (NPC) disease.
      Failure to significantly esterify LDL-derived cholesterol resulted in abnormal
      accumulation of predominantly unesterified cholesterol in homozygous NPC
      fibroblasts. Compared with normal and homozygous fibroblasts, heterozygous NPC
      fibroblasts synthesized intermediate levels of cholesteryl ester during the
      initial 6 h of incubation with LDL. The rate of cholesterol esterification in
      heterozygous cells was normal when measured over a 24-h period of incubation with
      LDL. In addition to demonstrating a defect in cholesterol esterification,
      homozygous NPC fibroblasts accumulated more total cholesterol when incubated with
      LDL or FBS than normal fibroblasts accumulated. When heterozygous NPC fibroblasts
      were incubated with LDL or FBS, cellular accumulation of cholesterol reached
      levels that were high-normal or intermediary between levels observed in normal
      and homozygous NPC fibroblasts. The partial expression of these metabolic errors 
      in the heterozygous genotype relevantly links these errors to the primary
      mutation of this disorder.

PG  - 16755-63
AB  - The biosynthesis, glycosylation, movement through the Golgi system, transport to 
      lysosomes, and turnover of three lysosomal integral membrane proteins (LIMPSs)
      have been studied in normal rat kidney cells using specific anti-LIMP monoclonal 
      antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy studies revealed the presence of LIMPs in
      secondary lysosomes, Golgi cisterna, and coated and uncoated vesicles located in 
      the trans-Golgi cisterna, area. Pulse-chase experiments recorded LIMP precursors 
      of 27 (LIMP I), 72 (LIMP II), and 86 kDa (LIMP III) and mature LIMPs of 35-50
      (LIMP I), 74 (LIMP II), and 90-100 kDa (LIMP III). Time course studies on the
      acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance by LIMPs indicated that all three
      LIMPs moved from the site of their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the 
      medial Golgi within 30-60 min after their synthesis. All three LIMPs were fully
      glycosylated before leaving the Golgi system, the process during which LIMP I was
      retained in the trans side of the organelle. LIMP I reached the lysosomes with a 
      halftime of 2 h and LIMPs II and III with half-times of 1 h after their synthesis
      by a mechanism that was independent of N-linked carbohydrates. LIMPs free of
      N-linked carbohydrates displayed much shorter half-lives than fully glycosylated 
      LIMPs, suggesting an important role of the sugars in protecting LIMPs against
      proteolytic degradation. Double immunofluorescence microscopy experiments showed 
      that LIMP I, LIMP II, and LIMP III are localized in the same lysosomes.

TI  - Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase purified from porcine leukocytes by immunoaffinity
      chromatography and its reactivity with hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids.
PG  - 16714-21
AB  - Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase was purified to near homogeneity from the cytosol
      fraction of porcine leukocytes by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose 
      chromatography, and immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody
      against the enzyme. The purified enzyme was unstable (half-life of about 24 h at 
      4 degrees C) but was markedly protected from the inactivation by storage in the
      presence of ferrous ion or in the absence of air. The lag phase which was
      observed before the start of the enzyme reaction was abolished by the presence of
      12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. An apparent substrate inhibition 
      was observed with arachidonic acid and other active substrates; however, the
      substrate concentration curve was normalized by the presence of 0.03% Tween 20.
      Arachidonic acid was transformed to the omega-9 oxygenation product
      12-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid. C-12 oxygenation also
      occurred with 5-hydroxy- and 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids; the respective 
      maximal velocities were 60 and 150% of the rate with arachidonic acid.
      Octadecaenoic acids were also good substrates. gamma-Linolenic acid was
      oxygenated in the omega-9 position (C-10), while linoleic and alpha-linolenic
      acids were subject to omega-6 oxygenation (C-13). A far more complex reaction was
      observed using 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid as substrate.
      Reaction occurred at 70% of the rate with arachidonic acid. The dihydroperoxy and
      dihydroxy products were identified by their UV absorption spectra, high
      performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
      Among these products, (8S,15S)-dihydroperoxy-5Z,9E,11Z,13E-eicos atetraenoic acid
      and (14R,15S)-erythro-dihydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E, 12E-eicosatetraenoic acid were
      produced in larger amounts than the (8R)- and (14S,15S)-threo isomers,
      respectively; these products were attributed to 8- and 14-oxygenation of the
      15-hydroperoxy acid. Furthermore, formation of 14,15-leukotriene A4 was inferred 
      from the characteristic pattern of its hydrolysis products comprised of equal
      amounts of (8R,15S)- and (8S,15S)-dihydroxy-5Z,9E,11E,13E-eicosatetraenoi c acids
      together with smaller amounts of (14R,15S)-erythro- and
      (14S,15S)-threo-dihydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,12E-eicosate traenoic acids. Thus, both
      lipoxygenase and leukotriene synthase activities were demonstrated with the
      homogeneous preparation of porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase.

      secretion of the Red Sea Moses sole (Pardachirus marmoratus).
PG  - 16704-13
AB  - A new column chromatography procedure, based on ion exchange, chromatofocusing,
      and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography was employed to isolate the
      two main proteinaceous, toxic, cytolytic, pore-forming factors from the secretion
      of the Red Sea Moses sole Pardachirus marmoratus. Pardaxin I, comprising 10% of
      the gland secretion proteins, was shown to be 5-10 times more toxic, cytolytic,
      and active in membrane pore formation than pardaxin II (8% of gland secretion
      proteins). Gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and NH2-terminal amino acid 
      sequence reveals a high degree of homogeneity and resemblance between the two
      toxins. They are rich in aspartic acid, serine, glycine, and alanine and devoid
      of arginine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Their NH2-terminal residue sequence was
      found to be NH2-Gly-Phe-Phe. Their hydrophobicity is evident from chromatographic
      behavior on a hydrophobic matrix, presence of 9 successive hydrophobic residues
      at the NH2 terminus, and a decrease in drop size during elution of active
      fractions during chromatographic purification. The minimal molecular weight of
      pardaxin I is about 3500 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel
      electrophoresis and amino acid analyses. It is composed of 35 amino acids and is 
      free of carbohydrate and sialic acid residues. Mass spectrometry of the ethyl
      acetate extract of the gland secretion and purified toxin reveals the presence of
      sterols in the secretion but their absence in the purified toxins. Pardaxin I was
      iodinated without affecting its chemical and pore-forming properties. It binds to
      liposomes of different phospholipid compositions. In hyperpolarized unilamellar
      liposomes, pardaxin I produced a fast, nonspecific permeabilization and in
      multilamellar liposomes, a slow, cation-specific pore. It is suggested that
      pardaxins exert their effects due to their hydrophobic and pore-formation
      properties.

PG  - 16689-97
AB  - The cDNAs encoding ethanol-inducible forms of rat and human cytochrome P-450s
      have been isolated, sequenced, and used to study the expression of this
      cytochrome P-450 during development and by various inducing agents. Polyclonal
      antibody against ethanol-inducible cytochrome P-450 was used to screen rat and
      human lambda gt11 cDNA expression libraries. The longest cDNAs obtained from each
      library were completely sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the rat
      cDNA was found to correspond to P450j based on the published amino-terminal
      sequence. The rat and human cytochrome P-450s both contained 493 amino acids and 
      calculated molecular masses of 56,634 and 56,916 daltons, respectively. Human
      P450j shared 75% nucleotide and 78% amino acid similarities to the respective
      orthologous rat cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences. Amino acid alignment also 
      revealed that P450j was 48% similar to P450b and P450e, the major
      phenobarbital-inducible forms, and 54% similar to P450PB1 and P450f, two
      developmentally regulated forms. Southern blot analyses of rat and human genomic 
      DNAs verified that only a single gene shared extensive homology with P450j. The
      expression of P450j was found to be developmentally regulated. No
      immunodetectable protein or P450j mRNA was present in newborn rats; however,
      rapid increases in P450j mRNA and protein occurred within 1 week after birth in
      both male and female rats. The levels of P450j and its mRNA thereafter remained
      elevated up to 12 weeks of age in both sexes. The increases in both P450j and its
      mRNA paralleled the change in aniline hydroxylase activity during development.
      Run-on transcriptional analysis confirmed that these increases were due to
      transcriptional activation of the P450j gene. In contrast to transcriptional
      activation during development, induction of P450j by various agents such as
      pyrazole, 4-methylpyrazole, and acetone might be due to post-transcriptional
      events. A 4-fold elevation in both enzymatic activity and immunodetectable P450j 
      was not accompanied by an increase in P450j mRNA level.

TI  - The amino-terminal domain of rabbit secretory component is responsible for
      noncovalent binding to immunoglobulin A dimers.
PG  - 16673-81
AB  - Rabbit secretory components (SC) constitute a family of markedly heterogeneous
      glycoproteins which are released in the secretions as free SC or as SC bound to
      polymeric immunoglobulins. The aim of this work was to determine the region of
      the SC polypeptides which is involved in IgA binding. The high and the low Mr
      forms of free SC (or IgA-dissociated bound SC) and the native secretory IgA
      complex were subjected to limited tryptic digestion. Chemically characterized
      peptides ranging in apparent size from 15 to 20 kDa, depending upon the allotype,
      were shown to be necessary and sufficient for efficient noncovalent binding to
      IgA dimers (subclass g). These fragments encompass the amino-terminal first
      domain of SC, i.e. residues 1-126, when aligned with the predicted amino acid
      sequence from a cDNA clone encoding the rabbit polymeric Ig receptor (Mostov,
      K.E., Friedlander, M., and Blobel, G. (1984) Nature 308, 37-43). The high and the
      low Mr forms of SC exhibited the same relative affinity for IgA dimers,
      suggesting that the postulated internal deletion in the smaller polypeptide
      (Kuhn, L. C., Kocher, H.-P., Hanly, W.C., Cook, L., Jaton, J.-C., and
      Kraehenbuhl, J.-P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6653-6659) does not impair the IgA 
      dimer recognition function.

TI  - Creatine kinase of heart mitochondria. Control of oxidative phosphorylation by
      the extramitochondrial concentrations of creatine and phosphocreatine.
PG  - 16579-83
AB  - Defining how extramitochondrial high-energy phosphate acceptors influence the
      rates of heart oxidative phosphorylation is essential for understanding the
      control of myocardial respiration. When the production of phosphocreatine is
      coupled to electron transport via mitochondrial creatine kinase, the net reaction
      can be expressed by the balanced equation: creatine + Pi----phosphocreatine +
      H2O. This suggests that rates of oxygen consumption could be regulated by changes
      in [creatine], [Pi], or [phosphocreatine], alone or in combination. The effects
      of altering these metabolites upon mitochondrial rates of respiration were
      examined in vitro. Rat heart mitochondria were incubated in succinate-containing 
      oxygraph medium (pH 7.2, 37 degrees C) supplemented with five combinations of
      creatine (1.0-20 mM), phosphocreatine (0-25 mM), and Pi (0.25-5.0 mM). In all
      cases, the mitochondrial creatine kinase reaction was initiated by additions of
      0.5 mM ATP. To emphasize the duality of control, the results are presented as
      three-dimensional stereoscopic projections. Under physiological conditions, with 
      5.0 mM creatine, increases in Pi or decreases in phosphocreatine had little
      influence upon mitochondrial respiration. When phosphocreatine was held constant 
      (15 mM), changes in [creatine] modestly stimulated respiratory rates, whereas Pi 
      again showed little effect. With 1.0 mM Pi, respiration clearly became dependent 
      upon changes in [creatine] and [phosphocreatine]. Initially, respiratory rates
      increased as a function of [creatine]. However, at [phosphocreatine] values below
      10 mM, product "deinhibition" was observed, and respiratory rates rapidly
      increased to 80% State 3. With 2.0 mM Pi or higher, respiration could be
      regulated from State 4 to 100% State 3. Overall, the data show how increasing
      [creatine] and decreasing [phosphocreatine] influence the rates of oxidative
      phosphorylation when mediated by mitochondrial creatine kinase. Thus, these
      changes may become secondary cytoplasmic signals regulating heart oxygen
      consumption.

TI  - Antibody specificity of human glomerular basement membrane type IV collagen NC1
      subunits. Species variation in subunit composition.
PG  - 16547-52
AB  - NC1 subunits were purified from gel filtration pools of acid-extracted,
      collagenase-digested human glomerular basement membranes (hGBM). This
      methodology, which enriches 28-kDa monomers (M28) in the total digest, allowed
      purification of these monomers and 24-kDa (M24) and 26-kDa (M26) monomers free
      from dimers. Reactivity of these subunits with Goodpasture autoantibodies using
      immunoblotting of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
      two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis gels showed strong
      reactivity with the purified M28 subunits. Inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay, used to quantitate the reactivity of the purified NC1 subunits, indicated 
      that M28 had a greater than 10-fold increase in ability to inhibit binding to NC1
      than NC1 itself. Comparison of hGBM NC1 components were made with those obtained 
      from collagenase digests of salt and acid-extracted bovine and sheep GBM and
      Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor similarly purified by gel filtration and
      reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two-dimensional gel
      analysis of these NC1 isolates revealed absence of the very cationic M28
      monomers. Reactivity with antibodies eluted from diseased kidneys of sheep
      immunized with hGBM (Steblay nephritis) was compared with Goodpasture
      autoantibody reactivity by immunoblotting two-dimensional gels of hGBM NC1. We
      conclude that a very cationic M28 monomer (M28 ) found only in hGBM is the
      probable target in Goodpasture syndrome, that the epitope is present on most NC1 
      components from extracted and unextracted hGBM, and is exposed by urea
      denaturation which is enhanced by acid treatment. A weakly cationic M28 monomer
      (M28+) is present in GBM from other species and is the probable target in Steblay
      nephritis. Differential recognition of the two M28 components by these antibodies
      points to different genetic origins or possibly distinct post-translational
      modifications for these components. This is supported by their presence or
      absence in different species and tissues, as well as biochemical differences from
      the M24/26 monomers which presumably are derived from alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV)
      collagen chains.

TI  - Separation of DNA binding domain from hormone and core histone binding domains by
      trypsin digestion of rat liver nuclear thyroid hormone receptor.
PG  - 16540-6
AB  - Rat liver nuclear thyroid hormone receptor was subjected to limited trypsin
      digestion, and the tryptic fragment of the 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine
      (T3)-receptor complex was characterized. Rat liver nuclear thyroid hormone
      receptor is an asymmetrical protein with Stokes radius of 34 A, sedimentation
      coefficient of 3.4 S, and molecular weight of 49,000. A globular T3-receptor
      complex with Stokes radius of 22 A, sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S, and
      molecular weight of 26,000 was obtained by tryptic digestion. This fragment had
      no DNA binding activity, whereas undigested receptor showed significant DNA
      binding activity. Addition of undigested receptor to the tryptic fragment did not
      restore DNA binding activity of digested receptor, nor did mixing inhibit DNA
      binding activity of undigested receptor complex. Undigested receptor bound to
      core histones, and this activity was stronger than with other proteins tested (H1
      histone, cytochrome c, and ovalbumin). The tryptic fragment of receptor
      maintained core histone binding activity comparable to that of undigested
      receptor. The tryptic fragment had affinity for T3 comparable to undigested
      receptor as assessed by Scatchard analysis and the same rate for dissociation of 
      [125I]T3 from receptor. The tryptic fragment of the T3-receptor complex was more 
      stable than undigested receptor at 43 degrees C. Digestion of receptor unoccupied
      by T3 caused a significantly larger loss of T3 binding capacity than did
      digestion of T3-occupied receptor, suggesting a protective effect of T3 on a
      second trypsin-sensitive site on the receptor, which, when cut, destroys T3
      binding activity.

TI  - The crystal structure of pea lectin at 3.0-A resolution.
PG  - 16518-27
AB  - The structure of pea lectin has been determined to 3.0-A resolution based on
      multiple isomorphous replacement phasing to 6.0-A resolution and a combination of
      single isomorphous replacement, anomalous scattering, and density modification to
      3.0-A resolution. The pea lectin model has been optimized by restrained least
      squares refinement against the data between 7.0- and 3.0-A resolution. The final 
      model at 3.0 A gives an R factor of 0.24 and a root mean square deviation from
      ideal bond distances of 0.02 A. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit are
      related by noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry to form a dimer. Monomers were
      treated independently in modeling and refinement, but are found to be virtually
      identical at this resolution. The molecular structure of the pea lectin monomer
      is very similar to that of concanavalin A, the lectin from the jack bean.
      Similarities extend from secondary and tertiary structures to the occurrence of a
      cis-peptide bond and the pattern of coordination of the Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions.
      Differences between the two lectin structures are confined primarily to the loop 
      regions and to the chain termini, which are different and give rise to the
      unusual permuted relationship between the pea lectin and concanavalin A protein
      sequences.

TI  - Interactions between spermine and Mg2+ on mitochondrial Ca2+ transport.
PG  - 16478-83
AB  - The effects of the polyamine spermine on the regulation of Ca2+ transport by
      subcellular organelles from rat liver, heart, and brain were investigated using
      ion-sensitive minielectrodes and a 45Ca2+ tracer method. Spermine stimulated Ca2+
      uptake by mitochondria but not by microsomes. In the presence of spermine,
      isolated mitochondria could maintain a free extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration
      of 0.3-0.2 microM. Stimulation of the initial rates of Ca2+ uptake and 45Ca2+
      cycling of mitochondria by spermine shows that this was accomplished through a
      decrease of the apparent Km for Ca2+ uptake by the Ca2+ uniporter. The half
      maximally effective concentration of spermine (50 microM) was in the range of
      physiological concentrations of this polyamine in the cell. Spermidine was five
      times less effective. Putrescine was ineffective. The stimulation of
      mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by spermine was inhibited by Mg2+ in a
      concentration-dependent manner. However, the diminished contribution of the
      mitochondria to the regulation of the free extraorganellar Ca2+ concentration
      could mostly be compensated for by microsomal Ca2+ uptake. Spermine also reversed
      ruthenium red-induced Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria. It is concluded that
      spermine is an activator of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and Mg2+ an
      antagonist. By this mechanism, the polyamines can confer to the mitochondria an
      important role in the regulation of the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in
      the cell and of the free Ca2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix.

TI  - Lack of correlation between extensive accumulation of bisnucleoside
      polyphosphates and the heat-shock response in eukaryotic cells.
PG  - 16459-65
AB  - The accumulation in large amounts of bisnucleoside polyphosphates (Ap4X) after
      heat shock in Xenopus laevis oocytes or cultured hepatoma cells (HTC cells) is
      observed after exposure to temperatures of 45 degrees C or higher. The
      accumulation is a transient phenomenon, with the collapse in cellular ATP
      concentration severely affecting the rate of synthesis of Ap4X, allowing
      degrading activities to empty the pool of these compounds under prolonged heat
      shock. This accumulation of Ap4X to high levels, compared to the basic content,
      is only observed under conditions leading to irreversible damage, ultimately
      resulting in the death of the cell. It is shown that the increase in Ap4X after
      hyperthermia is due to the partial or almost complete inhibition of their
      degradation pathways, rather than to a stimulation of their rate of synthesis.
      Finally, the synthesis of heat-shock proteins could be observed under conditions 
      which do not lead to important accumulation of Ap4X, therefore ruling out the
      possibility that these adenylylated nucleotides would behave as chemical signals 
      ("alarmones") triggering the synthesis of heat-shock proteins. Nevertheless, on
      the basis of our earlier results (Guedon, G., Sovia, D., Ebel, J. P., Befort, D.,
      and Remy, P. (1985) Embo J. 4, 3743-3749), it cannot be excluded that Ap4X might 
      play a role in the regulation of the heat-shock response; this would, however,
      rely on variations in Ap4X concentrations which do not exceed a factor of 2.

TI  - A universal oligonucleotide probe for acetylcholine receptor genes. Selection and
      sequencing of cDNA clones for the mouse muscle beta subunit.
PG  - 16451-8
AB  - A region of 25 nucleotides is highly conserved in genes coding for the alpha,
      beta, gamma, and delta subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of
      human, mouse, calf, chicken, and Torpedo. Based on this observation, a 2-fold
      degenerate oligonucleotide was synthesized and used as a probe to screen a cDNA
      library made from a mouse myogenic cell line. Clones coding for the beta, gamma, 
      and delta subunits were identified by the probe. The protein sequence deduced
      from the beta subunit clones codes for a precursor polypeptide of 501 amino acids
      with a calculated molecular weight of 56,930 daltons, which includes a signal
      peptide of 23 amino acids. The protein sequence and structural features of the
      beta subunits of mouse, calf, and Torpedo are conserved. A clone coding for the
      mouse gamma subunit was isolated, and its identity was confirmed by alignment of 
      its sequence to previously published cDNA sequences for the mouse and calf gamma 
      subunits. The clone contained approximately 200 nucleotides more at its 3' end
      untranslated region than a mouse gamma clone recently described. Northern blot
      analysis, utilizing as probes these beta and gamma subunit cDNAs and previously
      characterized alpha and delta subunit cDNAs, shows that the steady-state levels
      of the four AChR mRNAs increase coordinately during terminal differentiation of
      cultured C2 and C2i mouse myoblasts. The increase in mRNA levels can account for 
      the rise of cell surface receptors during myogenesis and suggests that the muscle
      AChR genes may be regulated during development by a common mechanism. Utilization
      of this oligonucleotide probe should prove useful for screening a variety of
      libraries made from different species and tissues which are known to express
      AChRs.

TI  - Mechanism-based inhibition of dopamine beta-monooxygenase by aldehydes and
      amides.
PG  - 16421-7
AB  - A mechanism for beta-chlorophenethylamine inhibition of dopamine
      beta-monooxygenase has been postulated in which enzyme-bound
      alpha-aminoacetophenone is generated, followed by an intramolecular redox
      reaction to yield a ketone-derived radical cation as the enzyme inhibitory
      species (Mangold, J. B., and Klinman, J. P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259,
      7772-7779). If correct, additional compounds capable of producing enzyme-bound
      (formula; see text) reductant should inhibit dopamine beta-monooxygenase.
      Phenylacetaldehyde was chosen to test this model, since
      beta-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is expected to function as a reductant in a manner
      analogous to alpha-aminoacetophenone. Phenylacetaldehyde exhibits the properties 
      of a mechanism-based inhibitor. Kinetic parameters are comparable to
      beta-chlorophenethylamine under both initial velocity and inactivation
      conditions. Since phenylacetaldehyde bears little resemblance to
      beta-chlorophenethylamine, its analogous inhibitory action provides support for
      an intramolecular redox reaction (via beta-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxidation to
      a radical cation) in dopamine beta-monooxygenase inactivation.
      beta-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde was identified as the enzymatic product of
      phenylacetaldehyde turnover. As predicted, this product behaves both as a
      time-dependent inhibitor of dopamine beta-monooxygenase and as an electron donor 
      in enzyme-catalyzed hydroxylation of tyramine to octopamine. Phenylacetamide and 
      p-hydroxyphenylacetamide are also found to be mechanism-based inhibitors of
      dopamine beta-monooxygenase. In this case the product of hydroxylation
      (beta-hydroxyphenylacetamide) is redox inactive and, therefore, is unable to
      function as either a reductant or an inhibitor. Thus, mechanism-based inhibitors 
      are divided into two types: type I, which undergoes hydroxylation prior to
      inactivation, and type II, which only requires hydrogen atom abstraction. A
      general mechanism for dopamine beta-monooxygenase inactivation is described, in
      which a common mechanistic radical intermediate is formed from both pathways.

TI  - Correction by 1-25-dihydroxycholecalciferol of the abnormal fluidity and lipid
      composition of enterocyte brush border membranes in vitamin D-deprived rats.
PG  - 16404-9
AB  - Weanling male Wistar rats were deprived of dietary and light sources of vitamin D
      for 11-18 weeks along with age-matched diet vitamin D-repleted controls to
      evaluate the role of lipid fluidity in the stimulatory effect of calcitriol on Ca
      transport. The "static" component of fluidity of proximal small intestine brush
      border membrane, as assessed by steady-state fluorescence techniques using the
      fluorophore 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, was similar between these two groups. 
      In contrast, the "dynamic" component of fluidity, as assessed by
      DL-2-(9-anthroyl)-stearic acid and DL-12-(9-anthroyl)-stearic acid, was decreased
      in membranes of D-deprived animals. Lipid composition was analyzed to evaluate
      the potential mechanism mediating these fluidity changes. In vitamin D-deprived
      rats, linoleic (18:2) and arachidonic (20:4) acids of the phosphatidylcholine and
      phosphatidylethanolamine fractions of the membrane were decreased, whereas
      palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acids were increased in the
      phosphatidylethanolamine fraction of the membrane. These associated fatty acyl
      alterations could explain, at least in part, the differences in membrane fluidity
      between D-repleted and D-deprived rats. Membrane fluidity, lipid composition, and
      duodenal Ca transport were also analyzed 1, 2, and 5 h after the acute
      administration of 1-25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to D-deprived animals. In
      D-deprived rats, within 1-2 h, this hormone restored to levels of vitamin
      D-repleted controls the dynamic component of fluidity and concentrations of the
      same membrane phospholipid fatty acids. Since these changes temporally precede
      detectable increases in Ca absorption (demonstrable only during the 5th h), these
      data support the hypothesis that alterations in membrane fluidity and lipid
      composition may play an important role in the stimulation of intestinal calcium
      transport by calcitriol.

TI  - The temperature-dependent stoichiometry of mixed cryoimmunoglobulins.
PG  - 16385-91
AB  - The interaction of three monoclonal rheumatoid factor IgM molecules with IgG
      antigens has been studied utilizing immunoglobulins isolated from three mixed
      cryoglobulins. Static light scattering measurements show that the stoichiometry
      of these immune complexes changes in a temperature-dependent manner from
      IgM(IgG)0-2 at temperatures greater than 37 degrees C to IgM(IgG)5 complexes at
      temperatures below 15 degrees C. These results were confirmed by the analysis of 
      the composition of polyethyleneglycol-precipitated complexes. For one mixed
      cryoglobulin (Glo), temperature-dependent changes in stoichiometry were also
      verified by chemical cross-linking studies. Binding constants were determined by 
      Scatchard analysis of light scattering data and by fluorescence polarization
      measurements. Values on the order of 10(5) M-1 were obtained for three monoclonal
      rheumatoid factor IgM molecules. Glo was further investigated by dynamic light
      scattering and partial specific volume measurements. Both dynamic light
      scattering and partial specific volume measurements provided evidence for
      surprising shape changes of the IgM X IgG complex as a function of temperature
      and IgG stoichiometry. Collectively, the data support the simple hypothesis that 
      cryoprecipitation of mixed cryoglobulins occurs as a consequence of increases in 
      the size (stoichiometry) of the complexes that are formed at low temperatures.

TI  - Antisuppressor mutations and sulfur-carrying nucleosides in transfer RNAs of
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
PG  - 16351-5
AB  - Antisuppressor mutations reduce the efficiency of nonsense suppressors. A
      mutation in the gene sin4 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe leads to loss of
      5-(methoxycarbonylmethyl) thiouridine (mcm5s2U) from the first anticodon position
      of tRNAs. This resembles the phenotype of sin3 (Heyer, W. D., Thuriaux, P.,
      Kohli, J., Ebert, P., Kersten, H., Gehrke, C., Kuo, K. C., and Agris, P. F.
      (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2856-2862), but the mutations reside in different
      genes. In vivo 35S-labeled tRNA from the parental suppressor strain sup3, the
      antisuppressor strains sin3 and sin4, and the double mutant sin3 sin4 has been
      digested to nucleosides and analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography 
      methods. The major sulfur-carrying nucleoside in wild-type S. pombe tRNA is
      mcm5s2U. It is reduced in the mutant strains. Two other thiolated nucleosides are
      also present: 2-thiouridine and a nucleoside of unknown structure. Neither was
      affected by the antisuppressor mutations. Thiocytidine has not been found.
      Independent from their effect on suppressors, the two mutations sin3 and sin4
      reduce the growth rate of cells, and sin3 also increases cell length. In vivo
      decoding of the serine codon UCG by the UCA reading serine tRNA is not promoted
      by the two antisuppressor mutations.

PG  - 16346-50
AB  - Turkey gizzard smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase is a calmodulin-dependent 
      enzyme containing 2 serine residues that can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent 
      protein kinase. One of these sites can be phosphorylated only when calmodulin is 
      not bound to the enzyme; the amino acid sequence around this site has been
      reported recently (Lukas, T. J., Burgess, W. H., Prendergast, F. G., Lau, W., and
      Watterson, D. M. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 1458-1464). Here we report the sequence 
      around the site that is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase whether
      or not calmodulin is bound:
      Lys-Ala-Ser(P)-Gly-Ser-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ile-Asn-Ala-Asp-Lys-Val-Glu-A sn-Glu- 
      . This sequence conforms to the previously defined criteria for substrates of
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

      primary metabolic pathways.
PG  - 16323-31
AB  - The flux of 13C-labeled carbons from the soluble metabolite
      2,3-cyclopyrophosphoglycerate (CPP), a novel compound found in high
      concentrations exclusively in methanobacteria and methanobrevibacter, into
      carbohydrate-containing material has been deduced by solid-state 13C NMR
      spectroscopy which strongly argues for a role in gluconeogenesis for this unique 
      metabolite. The turnover rates, but not the steady-state levels, of CPP labeled
      by 13CO2 or [13C]acetate depend dramatically on cell growth conditions. When the 
      demand for carbohydrate synthesis is reduced (i.e. in stationary phase), the
      rates of CPP biosynthesis and degradation decrease 10-fold, and the disaccharide 
      alpha, alpha-trehalose accumulates. Valinomycin, a metabolic inhibitor of
      Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum growth, does not affect steady-state levels 
      of CPP, but does decrease 13C uptake into the CPP pool. The effects of these
      different conditions on CPP labeling suggest stringent regulation of CPP linked
      to cellular metabolism. Labeling of CPP by [6-(13)C]glucose, which does not serve
      as an energy or carbon source for this organism, provides strong evidence that
      glucose is cleaved by the reverse of the gluconeogenesis pathway. This metabolic 
      pathway linking glucose with triose phosphate type precursors and an analysis of 
      the 13C NMR spectrum of CPP labeled by incubating cells with [U-13C]glucose have 
      established that in vivo phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase must be reversible.

PG  - 16317-22
AB  - We have used antisera directed towards eight different portions of the
      proenkephalin molecule to examine the processing rates and patterns of
      proenkephalin-derived peptides in chromaffin cell cultures in the presence and
      absence of reserpine. Reserpine treatment produced profound effects on the
      molecular weight profile of nearly all enkephalin-containing peptides. Increased 
      production of low molecular weight immunoreactive [Met5]enkephalin,
      [Leu5]enkephalin, [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8, and [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7
      was observed in reserpine-treated cultures; immunoreactivity corresponding to
      several intermediate sized enkephalin-containing peptides such as Peptide B and
      the high molecular weight [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 immunoreactive peptide 
      was decreased. The production of two amidated opioid peptides, amidorphin and
      metorphamide, was greatly accelerated in the presence of reserpine. The increased
      levels of low molecular weight enkephalins could not be accounted for by assuming
      decreased basal release. These results indicate that reserpine treatment is able 
      to increase the extent of post-translational processing of proenkephalin within
      chromaffin cells.

TI  - Differential turnover of phosphate groups on neurofilament subunits in mammalian 
      neurons in vivo.
PG  - 16298-301
AB  - The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific proteins was demonstrated
      directly in the intact vertebrate nervous system in vivo. By exploiting the
      neurons' ability to segregate a select group of cytoskeletal proteins from most
      other phosphorylated constituents of the cell by axoplasmic transport, we were
      able to examine the dynamics of phosphate turnover on neurofilament proteins in
      mouse retinal ganglion cell neurons simultaneously labeled with
      [32P]orthophosphate and [3H]proline in vivo. Three [3H]proline-labeled
      neurofilament protein (NFP) subunits, designated H (160-200 kDa), M (135-145
      kDa), and L (68-70 kDa), entered optic axons in a mole:mole ratio similar to that
      of isolated axonal neurofilaments, supporting the notion that newly synthesized
      NFPs are transported along axons as assembled neurofilaments. NFP subunits
      incorporated high levels of 32P before reaching axonal sites at the level of the 
      optic nerve. As neurofilaments were transported along axons, however, many
      initially incorporated [32P]phosphate groups were removed. Loss of these
      phosphate groups occurred to a different extent on each subunit. A minimum of
      50-60 and 35-40% of the labeled phosphate groups was removed in a 5-day period
      from the L and M subunits, respectively. By contrast, the H subunit exhibited
      relatively little or no phosphate turnover during the same period.
      Dephosphorylation of L in axons is accompanied by a decrease in its net state of 
      phosphorylation; changes in the phosphorylation state of H and M, however, also
      reflect ongoing addition of phosphates to these polypeptides during axonal
      transport (Nixon, R.A., Lewis, S.E., and Marotta, C.A. (1986) J. Neurosci., in
      press). The possibility is raised that dynamic rearrangements of phosphate
      topography on NFPs represent a mechanism to coordinate interactions of
      neurofilaments with other proteins as these elements are transported and
      incorporated into the stationary cytoskeleton along retinal ganglion cell axons.

TI  - Simulation of carboxymyoglobin photodissociation.
PG  - 16292-4
AB  - Computer-generated models of the structures of deoxymyoglobin and CO-bound
      myoglobin show that the CO molecule is not packed so tightly by the amino acid
      residues of the distal pocket to prevent its motion away from the iron atom upon 
      photodissociation. A simulation of low temperature photodissociation by energy
      minimization techniques shows that the CO moves to a position approximately 4 A
      away from the iron atom due to the van der Waals forces. The final position of
      the CO molecule requires far larger motion of the carbon atom than the oxygen
      atom and thereby suggests that the isotope dependence of the molecular tunneling 
      is a consequence of the orientation of the photodissociated CO.

PG  - 2758-63
AB  - The effects of preoperative irradiation on the morphology of transitional cell
      carcinomas (TCCs) were evaluated by studying the pretreatment biopsy and radical 
      cystectomy specimens from 35 patients. Twenty-six of these patients had received 
      2000 rad within the week preceding surgery, and nine patients had received no
      preoperative treatment. The frequency of bladders without residual TCC was 23%
      for irradiated and 22% for nonirradiated cases. Of the TCCs classified as
      papillary in the biopsy specimens and irradiated, 79% lacked a papillary
      component at cystectomy, but in no case was the invasive component eliminated or 
      regression from muscle invasion to superficial TCC noticed. Flat carcinoma in
      situ (CIS) did not respond to irradiation. At cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was
      greater than at biopsy in 60% of the irradiated TCCs, whereas all nonirradiated
      cases retained the same grade as at biopsy. In addition, irradiation induced
      squamous differentiation in neoplastic cells only, without affecting the
      nonneoplastic urothelium.

TI  - Monitoring intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment of superficial bladder
      carcinoma by serial flow cytometry.
PG  - 2751-7
AB  - Simultaneous urinary flow cytometry, cytologic, and cystoscopic examinations were
      performed at 3-month intervals for a minimum of 1 year on 29 patients receiving
      intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment of superficial bladder
      carcinoma. Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103
      examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma 
      was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were
      negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations
      were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and
      cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances)
      and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the
      25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3
      (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%),
      suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe
      BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid
      population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In
      the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively
      high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only
      eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, 
      at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the
      nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and
      negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy,
      the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology
      was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than
      conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive 
      rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid
      stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be
      helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, 
      it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with 
      FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked
      inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent
      conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in
      the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of
      further increasing the accuracy of FCM.

TI  - Cardiac abnormalities in patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma.
PG  - 2744-50
AB  - Many patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma have dyspnea or chest
      pain. Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from
      symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical
      characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the
      electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with
      biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64
      (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 
      55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia
      (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation
      (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality,
      including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right
      bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with 
      pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior 
      sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with
      more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It
      is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of 
      patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs 
      in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and
      echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from
      progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma.

TI  - Pleuroperitoneal shunting for malignant pleural effusions.
PG  - 2740-3
AB  - Traditional therapy for malignant pleural effusions includes thoracentesis or
      tube drainage with instillation of irritants to achieve pleurodesis. This can
      require a lengthy hospitalization, causes pain and discomfort, and has an
      appreciable failure rate. Because of these drawbacks, the authors used a shunting
      device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant
      pleural effusions. Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic
      thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis. The shunt
      was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal
      catheters, which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal
      abdominal/pleural pressure gradient. Operative placement under local or general
      anesthesia was performed without complication. Five patients achieved minimal
      benefit, either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the
      pump effectively. In the other 12 patients, there was radiographic evidence of
      diminished or stabilized pleural effusion; respiratory symptoms were effectively 
      palliated, and no further treatment for their effusion was required. Peritoneal
      dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected. We feel that
      pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant
      pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low
      morbidity. Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility 
      for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement. Shunting is
      applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is
      particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted
      pleural sclerosis.

AB  - The occurrence of breast cancer in two related males, an uncle and nephew is
      reported. A review of previously reported cases of male breast cancer occurring
      in families and the association with other cancers in other family members is
      included. In previous reports on breast cancer in males, familial or hereditary
      factors have not generally been recognized as a major contributing factor. Of ten
      families reported (including our own) where there is sufficient information
      given, six families (60%) had females with breast cancer. It appears there are
      some families in which males as well as females have an increased risk of
      developing breast cancer.

TI  - Prognostic factors in neuroblastomas treated in Denmark from 1943 to 1980. A
      statistical estimate of prognosis based on 253 cases.
PG  - 2726-35
AB  - Multivariate analysis on an unselected patient population consisting of all 253
      children treated for neuroblastoma in Denmark during 1943 to 1980 shows that
      stage, age, and treatment given are independent prognostic variables. Calendar
      year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not
      significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment 
      with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 
      year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The
      fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have
      independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all
      neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at
      diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus,
      according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of
      micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it
      represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have
      eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence
      on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this
      study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this
      theory.

TI  - Total and lipid-associated serum sialic acid levels in cancer patients with

PG  - 2680-5
AB  - Serum total sialic acid (TSA) and lipid-associated sialic acid (LASA) levels have
      drawn considerable interest because of carbohydrate aberrations in malignant
      cells. The current investigation determined the TSA, LASA, total protein (TP),
      and TSA/TP values for 171 cancer patients with various primary sites and
      differing degrees of metastatic disease, 102 patients with nonmalignant diseases 
      (pathologic controls), and 42 normal individuals. Data analysis indicated
      significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the mean (+/- SD) TSA and TSA/TP
      values in the cancer patients (78.1 +/- 19.2 mg/dl and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mg/g,
      respectively) and in the pathologic controls (76.0 +/- 7.5 mg/dl and 11.6 +/- 2.5
      mg/g) when compared to the normal controls (67.3 +/- 7.1 mg/dl and 9.0 +/- 1.1
      mg/g), and a significant decrease in the mean TP values in the cancer patients
      (6.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl) and pathologic controls (6.6 +/- 1.1 g/dl) when compared to
      normal controls (7.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). No significant difference was observed
      between groups in LASA values. Further analysis of the data in patient subgroups 
      based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the malignancy
      indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to
      restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of TSA and TSA/TP increased as the 
      malignancy became more severe. The results show that TSA/TP was the most useful
      of the markers tested for detecting malignancies. This marker should prove useful
      for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating
      the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches.

PG  - 2675-9
AB  - The serum testosterone level (STL) was determined in 84 male and 32 female
      patients with gastric carcinoma and in 58 male and 20 female patients with benign
      diseases as a control group. The STL of the male patients with carcinoma was
      lower (446 +/- 149 ng/dl) than that of the male control group (532 +/- 132 ng/dl)
      (P less than 0.001). Even 17 male patients of the early carcinoma showed lower
      STL (440 +/- 117 ng/dl) than the normal group (P less than 0.001). In the female 
      patients, it was also lower (31.6 +/- 16.0 ng/dl) than in the control group (46.3
      +/- 15.3 ng/dl) (P less than 0.005). The postoperative STL of the cases surviving
      the gastrectomy was higher than the preoperative data in 32 male patients (P less
      than 0.005) as well as in 12 female patients (0.025 greater than P greater than
      0.01), whereas it obviously decreased in the patients who died of recurrence.
      Therefore, it appears that gastric carcinoma decreases the STL by some mechanism.

TI  - Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer. Report of six cases and review 
      of the literature.
PG  - 2656-61
AB  - Head and neck cancer has rarely been reported to be a cause of meningeal
      carcinomatosis. These tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather
      than distant metastasis. This would appear to preclude meningeal involvement, but
      close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges.
      Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six 
      cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant
      cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative.
      The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement.
      The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most
      frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No 
      patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an
      Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary
      head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya
      placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent
      than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather
      than hematogenous spread.

TI  - Malignant lymphoma of bone.
PG  - 2646-55
AB  - A total of 422 patients with malignant lymphoma of bone who were seen at the Mayo
      Clinic from 1907 through 1982 were placed into four major groups based on stage
      of disease. There was one group with primary lymphoma of bone, one group with
      multifocal osseous lymphoma, and two groups with lymphoma of bone and nodal or
      soft tissue (or both) disease. The last-mentioned two groups were separated on
      the basis of time of onset of osseous lymphoma in relation to the nonosseous
      disease. The stage of disease was the single most important prognostic indicator 
      of overall survival in malignant lymphoma of bone. The 5- and 10-year survival
      rates were, respectively, 58% and 53% for patients with primary bone lymphoma,
      22% and 12.5% for patients with bone and nodal or soft tissue (or both) disease, 
      and 42% and 35% for patients with multifocal osseous disease. Features having no 
      significant prognostic value were sex of the patient, histologic grade of the
      lymphoma (according to the Working Formulation and the Kiel system), and presence
      of T-cell features or cleaved cells (or both). This study is not able to
      adequately address efficacy of treatment. In fact, treatment may be very
      important in outcome.

TI  - Tuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. A systemic process.
PG  - 2640-5
AB  - Virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome has been recently identified as a
      benign, reactive histiocytic proliferation distinct from Rappaport's malignant
      hystiocytosis. Other etiologic agents, including different bacteria, have also
      been identified. Three autopsy cases of hemophagocytic syndrome associated to
      acute tuberculous sepsis are presented. Benign histiocytic proliferation with
      striking hemophagocytosis was present in a disseminated, multisystemic pattern in
      all three cases. A relationship between systemic histiocytic proliferation and an
      anergic status in these patients is suggested.

TI  - Cell mediated and humoral immune responses in oral submucous fibrosis.
PG  - 2628-31
AB  - Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were assessed in 50 patients with oral
      submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and the results were compared with those of 50 patients
      with oral-leukoplakia, 50 oral cancer patients, and 50 normal healthy adult
      controls. The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to 
      be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total
      rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered. Levels of serum IgA, IgD, and
      IgE were found to be elevated both in OSMF and oral cancer. Immunologic
      derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in OSMF. The
      enumeration of HARFC along with the estimation of serum levels of IgA, IgD, and
      IgE indicates that OSMF can be an intermediary stage in the malignant
      transformation of a normal cell, and that these parameters may serve as markers
      for the early detection of oral cancer.

PG  - 2622-4
AB  - In 37 patients with seemingly localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the Waldeyer's 
      ring (WR-NHL), lymphangiography (LAG) and/or gallium-67 scans (Ga-67 scans) were 
      done. Before these procedures, 20 patients were diagnosed as Stage I, and 17 as
      Stage II. LAG was done for 30, and Ga-67 scans for 32, 25 of whom had both. Five 
      patients (16%) were upstaged to Stage III or IV by Ga-67 scans. Only one (3%) had
      abnormal LAG findings, in whom Ga-67 scans also showed abnormal accumulation in
      the para-aortic region. Because of this low positive rate, LAG is not recommended
      for staging of WR-NHL.

PG  - 2606-10
AB  - Of a total of 1561 patients registered in the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study
      (IRS) as of May 1983, 78 patients (5%) were younger than 1 year of age. These
      infants did not differ from the older children (1-20 years of age) in male/female
      ratio, clinical grouping, or survival rates. Infants younger than 1 year of age
      had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma, 18% versus 7% 
      in older children (P less than 0.005). Infants also had a significantly greater
      proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology, 10% versus 4% in older children (P
      less than 0.005). When reviewed by the newly proposed IRS cytopathologic
      classification, there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age
      groups. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of
      bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children, 24% versus 10%
      (P less than 0.05). In addition, infants tended to receive less of the prescribed
      doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children, and to develop
      more toxicity to treatment than older children. Despite these differences, the
      overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar. In contrast 
      to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, in which age (less than 1 year) is a favorable
      prognostic factor, age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in
      rhabdomyosarcoma.

PG  - 2589-93
AB  - Between July 1973 and December 1979, 1171 patients with metastatic breast cancer 
      were treated with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. Of those patients, 195 had
      osseous metastases only. Upon initial diagnosis, 48% had osteolytic metastases;
      13% had osteoblastic metastases; 38% had mixed metastases; and 1% had diffuse
      osteoporosis without any obvious bone destruction. The most common sites of
      involvement were the dorsal spine (62%), lumbosacral spine (72%), and pelvis
      (79%). Objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 59% of patients;
      complete responses were noted in 7%, and partial responses in 52%. The median
      survival was 28 months (range, 1-118 months). The median time lapse between the
      start of chemotherapy and disease progression was 14 months (range, 1-109
      months). In 32 patients who responded to the treatment, chemotherapy was
      discontinued after 2 years, and their median duration of continued remission at
      39 and 75 months after the completion of therapy. The incidence of pathological
      fractures was 57%; the most common sites were the spine, which sustained
      compression fractures, and the ribs. The incidences of hypercalcemia and spinal
      cord compression due to metastases were 19% and 10%, respectively.

PG  - 2585-8
AB  - Methylglyoxal bis (guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) is an inhibitor of polyamine
      synthesis. In vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of some tumor cells in S
      and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Nineteen patients with advanced head and neck
      cancer were entered in a Phase II trial of MGBG. MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was
      administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2
      weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly
      treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease
      recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial
      response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea,
      vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. 
      Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2
      was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination
      chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single
      agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response
      rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a
      heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single
      agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients.
      However, because of its biochemical effects, further testing in combination with 
      cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior
      treatment may be warranted.

      patients.
PG  - 2576-8
AB  - Ninety-six patients with disseminated malignant melanoma received thrice weekly
      intramuscular injections of leukocyte A recombinant interferon (rIFN-alpha A,
      Roferon-A, Hoffmann La Roche) at doses of 12 X 10(6) U/m2 or 50 X 10(6) U/m2 with
      or without cimetidine as an immunorestorative agent. Four patients, two with
      prior chemotherapy, demonstrated either a complete response (3 months, soft
      tissue metastasis) or exceptionally durable response durations (months) of 29+
      (soft tissue; lung lesion), 31+ (soft tissue), and 35+ (soft tissue; liver
      lesions). None of these patients had particularly characteristic clinical
      parameters. As noted previously, using chemotherapy, a small proportion of
      patients with advanced malignant melanoma, despite prior therapy, may achieve
      prolonged objective regression with rIFN-alpha A.

TI  - Chromosome studies in preleukemic states. V. Prognostic significance of single
      versus multiple abnormalities.
PG  - 2571-5
AB  - The prognostic value of marrow chromosome findings was examined in 242 patients
      with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorders 
      (MPD), with emphasis on the significance of single versus multiple karyotypic
      changes. In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple
      chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early
      death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic 
      dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one
      karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation),
      survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without
      chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated 
      with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that
      the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of
      chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance
      of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic
      status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts
      to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders.

TI  - Injuries associated with off-road vehicles among children.
PG  - 1365-6
AB  - Off-road vehicles have attained growing popularity, expanding markets and
      increasing rates of associated injury, especially among young people. In 1984-85,
      148 patients were treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, 
      for injuries suffered in off-road vehicle accidents. The average age of the
      patients was 14 years. Soft-tissue injuries occurred in 33 patients, 21 of whom
      had severe injuries. There were 179 fractures in 133 patients. One patient died
      as a result of his injuries. The most common mechanism of injury was losing
      control of and tumbling from the machine. Seventeen patients were struck by their
      own vehicles, and 39 collided with objects such as cars, trees or people. The
      health care costs of these accidents are no less serious than the concerns for
      the appropriate legislation to protect consumers, particularly the young.

TI  - Changing motivation in severely suicidal patients.
PG  - 1361-3
AB  - While the ambiguity of suicidal patients' stated motivations has been studied in 
      some detail, less attention has been given to the changeability of their
      motivations. Twenty-six patients who had taken an overdose of paraquat, a highly 
      lethal herbicide, were questioned about their motivation at the time of admission
      and 24 hours and 3, 7 and 10 days later. Although 25 patients claimed that they
      wished to die at the time of admission, all of the 14 surviving patients wished
      to live at the time of discharge from hospital. Of the 12 patients who died, 6
      stated that they no longer wished to die in the last interview before their
      death. During the following year 3 of the 14 surviving patients killed
      themselves. The findings emphasize the importance of thoroughly assessing all
      aspects of the suicidal patient's situation in determining risks. The patient's
      stated intentions should be but one factor considered.

      elastase and alpha-chymotrypsin by (dl)-3-benzyl-N-(methanesulfonyloxy)
      succinimide.
PG  - 741-8
AB  - (dl)-3-Benzyl-N-(methanesulfonyloxy) succinimide 5 has been found to inactivate
      human leukocyte elastase and alpha-chymotrypsin efficiently and irreversibly. The
      kobsd/[I] values were 1170 and 9000 M-1 s-1 respectively. Porcine pancreatic
      elastase was not inhibited by 5. Compound 5 may constitute the first example of a
      mechanism-based inhibitor of a serine proteinase that appears to exert its effect
      via an unprecedented enzyme-induced Lossen rearrangement.

TI  - Tetracycline can inhibit tRNA binding to the ribosomal P site as well as to the A
      site.
PG  - 723-6
AB  - A and P sites of Escherichia coli ribosomes were titrated with AcPhe-tRNAPhe, in 
      the absence or presence of tetracycline. The P-site location of the bound
      AcPhe-tRNA was assessed by means of a quantitative puromycin reaction. The
      results demonstrate that, in agreement with the generally held view, tetracycline
      exclusively inhibits the A-site binding, if the statistical number of bound
      acyl-tRNA molecules per ribosome does not exceed about 0.5. However, above this
      value the P site becomes sensitive to tetracycline as well. It follows that the
      tightly coupled 70S ribosomes used in functional studies appear to be
      functionally heterogeneous, i.e. those P sites which cannot be affected by
      tetracycline are preferentially occupied by AcPhe-tRNA, whereas higher
      concentrations of this tRNA species are required to fill tetracycline-sensitive P
      sites. Furthermore, the results imply that under tRNA saturation conditions the
      tetracycline inhibition cannot be used as an indicator for the site location of
      bound tRNA.

TI  - Characterization of the elongation factors from calf brain. 2. Functional
      properties of EF-1 alpha, the action of physiological ligands and kirromycin.
PG  - 647-53
AB  - The properties of EF-1 alpha from calf brain have been investigated and compared 
      with those of EF-Tu. EF-1 alpha binds GDP and GTP in a 1:1 stoichiometry, showing
      the same affinity for both nucleotides (K'd = 2-4 microM). EF-1 beta strongly
      enhances the dissociation rate of the EF-1 alpha X GDP complex and to a lesser
      extent of the EF-1 alpha X GTP complex. Aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) stabilized EF-1 
      alpha X GTP much less efficiently than the EF-Tu X GTP complex. Unlike EF-Tu,
      EF-1 alpha sustains the binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosome also in the presence
      of GDP or in the absence of any nucleotide, though to a lesser degree than with
      GTP. Kirromycin enhances the dissociation rate of both EF-1 alpha X GTP and EF-1 
      alpha X GDP but especially that of the latter. This effect results in an increase
      of the exchange rate of the EF-1 alpha-bound nucleotide with free nucleotides.
      Although in this regard the effect of kirromycin mimics that of EF-1 beta, the
      antibiotic is incapable of increasing the EF-1 alpha X GDP/GTP exchange rate when
      aa-tRNA and ribosomes are present. Therefore, unlike EF-1 beta, kirromycin cannot
      enhance the rate of poly(Phe) synthesis. On the other hand, the failure of
      kirromycin to induce a GTP-like conformation of EF-1 alpha X GDP, as in the case 
      of EF-Tu X GDP, explains its inability to inhibit peptide bond formation in the
      eukaryotic system.

TI  - Structural organization of apolipoprotein B-100 of human plasma low density
      lipoproteins. Comparison to B-48 of chylomicrons and very low density
      lipoproteins.
PG  - 16744-8
AB  - The present study characterizes the substructural organization of apolipoprotein 
      B-100 (B-100) of human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) and its relation to 
      B-74 and B-26 of LDL and B-48 of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. 
      LDL were digested with human kallikrein and thrombin to yield two major
      fragments: K1 (Mr 410,000) and K2 (Mr 145,000) and T1 (Mr 385,000) and T2 (Mr
      170,000), respectively. The antigenic sequences, Mr, and amino acid compositions 
      of K1 and K2 were identical to those of plasma B-74 and B-26; B-26 and K2 had
      identical NH2-terminal sequences and correspond to the NH2-terminal region of
      B-100. K1 was further degraded by kallikrein to give K3 (Mr 235,000) and K4 (Mr
      170,000); these peptides correspond immunochemically to two newly discovered
      plasma LDL peptides B-44 and B-30 and are assigned as complementary fragments of 
      B-74. The thrombin cleavage fragments, T1 and T2, did not correspond to B-74 and 
      B-26. Neither kallikrein nor thrombin generated a fragment from B-100
      corresponding to B-48 in chylomicrons. However, B-48 showed antigenic homology
      with B-26 and to the of B-74 adjoining B-26, indicating that its structure is
      represented in the NH2-terminal half of B-100. The structural studies further
      clarify the relatedness among the B-100, B-74, B-26, and B-48 polypeptides and
      should now make possible the delineation of the functional domains mediating the 
      interactions of apolipoprotein B in the circulation and arterial wall.

PG  - 700-2
AB  - Sensitivity and specificity of the behaviour of the R-amplitudes under exercise
      are investigated at an additional lead position on the anterior chest wall, which
      in previous multi-electrode-examinations showed a higher sensitivity than the
      conventional Wilson-leads V 4 and V 5. For the criterion "increase of
      R-amplitudes" could certainly be confirmed a higher sensitivity at the additional
      lead position, the bad specificity both at the conventional and at the additional
      lead position allows, however, only the inclusion of the decrease of the
      physiological R-amplitude into the exclusion diagnostics of the chronic ischaemic
      heart disease.

TI  - [Pressure measurements of pneumatically driven artificial ventricles].
PG  - 689-92
AB  - In the mock circulation are investigated methods for pressure measurement
      developed especially for the application on artificial ventricles. They require
      the in-vivo-confirmation in the long-term experiment. An exact analysis of the
      pressure curves gives information about the absolute measuring values and also
      about the function of the pump itself, such as about the points of reaching the
      final positions of the pump membrane. Via a control related to this in the "full 
      stroke" mode with ejection of the complete stroke volume, when the stand-still
      times of the membrane are minimized, in addition to this the atrial pressures and
      the cardiac output can be determined. Eventual non-linearities in the lower
      pressure region (less than or equal to 0.5 kPa) are not essential in the
      measurement of the ventricular pressure with amplitudes of 20-25 kPa on the left 
      side and are not investigated in detail.

TI  - [The telemetric emergency electrocardiography--practical use and methodologic
      effectiveness].
PG  - 685-9
AB  - The study of 797 emergency provisions shows that it is possible to improve the
      implementation of internal emergency measures in respect of operation and safety 
      by means of telemetric emergency-electrocardiography by eliminating electric
      cables and their resulting interference factors. Thereby the proper signal
      receiving by fixed thorax electrodes or a maintenance-free electrode-transmitter 
      unit serving as an "electronic emergency electrode" meets the requirements of the
      case of emergency for an ECG-recording under mechanical stress or without delay. 
      The application of this procedure is especially recommended for emergency and
      danger situation in which cabling is connected with risks as to operation and
      safety. After providing all the technical preconditions for the wireless
      communication telemetric signal transmitting is unreservedly to be applied for
      practical emergency provision.

TI  - [Cytology of bone marrow metastases of malignant tumors].
PG  - 682-5
AB  - It is reported on the bone marrow involvement of 389 malignant tumors
      investigated by sternal marrow aspiration. The frequency of skeletal metastases
      as revealed by routinely taken bone marrow aspiration was 20.3%. Bone marrow
      metastases were detected mostly in tumors of prostatic, pancreatic, renal and
      ovarian origin, in cancers of the breast and in melanoblastoma. Positive
      cytological findings increased to 29.0% in those metastatic tumors, where the
      frequency of metastases had been identified with clinical and different
      laboratory methods. In cases, where these methods detected the primary tumor
      only, the metastatic frequency was 13.4% in form of micrometastases, invisible by
      x-ray examination. The cell type of the metastatic tumor did not allow to
      localize the primary site of the disease. Non-specific reactions as eosinophilia 
      and microgranuloma, both increased, are not specific but suspicious of skeletal
      metastases.

TI  - [Therapeutic electrical procedures in recurring, drug refractory tachycardias. I.
      Antitachycardiac implantable pacemaker systems].
PG  - 676-82
AB  - In 9 Patients with medicamentously therapy-refractory tachycardias (twice
      paroxysmal AV-node-reentry tachycardia, four times paroxysmal orthrodromic
      reentry tachycardia in the WPW-syndrome, once paroxysmal atrial reentry
      tachycardia, twice recurrent ventricular tachycardia) after adequate
      electrophysiological testings antitachycardiac pacemakers able to activate the
      patients were implanted. In these cases the implantable tachyblocker TUR-RFP-01
      was used in 4 cases for the highly frequent volley atrial stimulation, in 2 cases
      for the more highly frequent volley ventricular stimulation. In 3 patients the
      interruption of the tachycardia was performed by ventricular underdrive
      stimulation by means of putting the magnet on a conventional R-wave-inhibited
      ventricular pacemaker. In all cases the recurrent tachycardias could reliably be 
      terminated by the patients themselves by activation of the antitachycardiac
      systems (duration of the follow-up period 3-14 months, on an average 10.7 +/- 3.4
      months); only in one case in the further course a change of the stimulation
      parameters was necessary which were carefully tested at the beginning. On account
      of the danger of the acceleration of the tachycardia and of the evocation of
      ventricular fibrillation, respectively, should, however, be performed highly
      frequent ventricular stimulations for the termination of ventricular tachycardias
      only in readiness for defibrillation.

TI  - [Thiobarbituric acid positive substances as indicators of lipid peroxidation].
PG  - 673-6
AB  - Polyenic acids of particularly membrane-bound lipids can be disintegrated
      non-enzymatically by oxygen radicals or enzymatically by peroxidation. Final
      products of the lipid peroxidation are malon dialdehyde, n-alcanes, n-alcanales, 
      hydroxyalcanales, 2-alcenales. Alca-2,4-dienales. Hydroxyalcenales and ketones.
      Products of lipid peroxidation can react with proteins and glycosaminoglycans.
      Thus receptor binding of the LDL, enzyme activities, DNA- and protein synthesis
      can be inhibited. Of the peroxidation products malon dialdehyde is relatively
      specifically recognizable by the reaction of the thiobarbituric acid. Size and
      clinical significance of processes of lipid peroxidation are up to now only
      little known in several diseases, but they might be of great importance for
      numerous pathological processes.

TI  - Three abnormal fibrinogen variants with the same amino acid substitution (gamma

PG  - 401-6
AB  - We report on three unrelated individuals with the same uncommon type of
      dysfibrinogenemia, originating from Bergamo, Essen and Perugia. None of them
      showed bleeding symptoms while the Bergamo patient and members of her family
      presented with a thrombotic tendency. The presence of a defective fibrinogen was 
      suggested by prolonged thrombin and reptilase times. Furthermore, fibrinogen
      concentrations of less than 0.28 g/L were determined by the functional assay
      whereas values of 1.5-2.4 g/L were measured by heat precipitation or
      electroimmunoassay. Fibrinogen was isolated by affinity chromatography on
      insoluble fibrin monomer. The rate of fibrinopeptide release by thrombin was
      normal while the fibrin polymerization reaction was strongly delayed. An abnormal
      peptide (gamma 265-310) was isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography
      after cyanogen bromide cleavage of the purified gamma-chain of fibrinogen Bergamo
      II and Essen. The same peptide was also isolated following cyanogen bromide
      treatment of the intact fibrinogen Perugia. Sequence analyses of these peptides
      demonstrated the same amino acid exchange in all three fibrinogens: gamma 275
      arginine----histidine. The described fibrinogen variants appear to possess a
      molecular defect which has thus far only been observed in fibrinogen Haifa.

TI  - Role of red blood cells in the early stages of platelet activation by collagen.
PG  - 376-81
AB  - Red blood cells (RBC) increase the proaggregatory capacity of a cell-free
      supernatant obtained by stimulating platelet-rich plasma (PRP) samples with
      collagen (1 microgram/ml) as measured by the BASIC wave; this effect increases
      with the number of RBC and is proportionally greater with a lower number of
      platelets or when lower collagen concentrations are used. Aspirin (ASA) modifies 
      the RBC behaviour in relation to their platelet-collagen interaction. This is
      demonstrated by the fact that when PRP and RBC obtained from the same subjects
      before and two hours after the ingestion of ASA (0.5 g) were mixed, it was found 
      that non-ASA-RBC stimulate ASA-PRP, probably through a platelet cyclooxygenase
      independent pathway; ASA-RBC, however, stimulate non-ASA-PRP, but not ASA-PRP,
      which suggests that they may need an active platelet cyclooxygenase system for
      their action. This effect of ASA on RBC is not transient and was also observable 
      48 h after ASA ingestion. In addition, it was found that ASA-RBC greatly increase
      the activation of a mixture containing a small proportion of non-ASA-PRP in
      ASA-PRP, a situation that is expected to be encountered "in vivo" after ASA
      treatment. This effect of ASA-RBC on platelet activation may help to explain the 
      sometimes contradictory clinical effect of aspirin as an antithrombotic drug.

TI  - The negative impact of biological variation in the effect and clearance of
      warfarin on methods for prediction of dose requirements.
PG  - 371-5
AB  - Within-individual variation over time in the clearance (Cl) and effect (PT%) of
      warfarin, was measured in 25 inpatients (group I) studied after standard single
      or individualized split loading doses and 1-3 times (n = 16) 8-16 weeks later
      during maintenance. Mean Cl (2.5 +/- 0.9 ml/min) was similar in both phases but
      significant changes occurred in 6/16 patients, exceeding those expected from
      within-individual variation alone (defined by its 95% tolerance limits -24% to
      +62%). Initial PT% (21 +/- 5) was unaffected by dosing schedule, total or free
      plasma warfarin, varying between patients by only 18-24%. Mean initial and
      maintenance dose-PT% ratios (8.2 mg/d: 21% and 4.1 mg/d: 40%) were similar but
      significant changes in sensitivity to warfarin occurred in 4/16 patients. In
      group I and 64 other outpatients on maintenance therapy, between-individual
      variability was 36-52% for Cl and 49-56% for effect. PT% correlated best (r =
      0.56) with free and total plasma warfarin but poorly with dose (r = 0.29), with
      only 30% of PT% variance explained at best, due to high between patient
      variability. Warfarin dose prediction whether based on extrapolation from initial
      effects to the maintenance phase, or on iterative methods not allowing for
      between- or within-patient variation in warfarin clearance or effect which may
      occur independently over time, have not improved on empirical therapy. This, due 
      to the elements of biological variability as well as the intricacy of the
      warfarin-prothrombin complex interaction not captured by any kinetic-dynamic
      model used for prediction to date.

PG  - 360-3
AB  - Piretanide, 4-phenoxy-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-5-sulfamoyl benzoic acid, a potent
      diuretic, enhances endogenous plasma fibrinolytic activity after a single dose of
      6 mg administered orally. Acceleration of fibrinolytic activity becomes manifest 
      within 1 h, reaches its peak in 3 h and is associated with little change in
      fibrinogen, however, it is accompanied with diminished urokinase excretion
      initially. Piretanide does not cause lysis of fibrin in vitro in any
      concentration. Primary platelet aggregation, induced by adenosine-diphosphate, is
      inhibited by piretanide, in vivo. In in vitro experiments piretanide leads to
      effective inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation with complete inhibition
      at 5 mM concentration. Piretanide, after ingestion of a single dose of 6 mg,
      causes highly significant decrease of platelet factor-4 release.

      binding.
PG  - 349-52
AB  - Four members of an Italian family (two with histories of venous thromboembolism) 
      had a qualitative defect of antithrombin III reflected by normal antigen
      concentrations and half-normal antithrombin activity with or without heparin.
      Anti-factor Xa activities were consistently borderline low (about 70% of normal).
      For the propositus' plasma and serum the patterns of antithrombin III in
      crossed-immunoelectrophoresis with or without heparin were indistinguishable from
      those of normal plasma or serum. A normal affinity of antithrombin III for
      heparin was documented by heparin-sepharose chromatography. Affinity adsorption
      of the propositus' plasma to human alpha-thrombin immobilized on sepharose beads 
      revealed defective binding of the antithrombin III to thrombin-sepharose. Hence
      the molecular defect of this variant appears to be at the active site responsible
      for binding and neutralizing thrombin, thus accounting for the low thrombin
      inhibitory activity.

TI  - Haemophilia B Leyden in Greece.
PG  - 340-2
AB  - In this paper, a five generation Greek family is described with haemophilia B.
      The disease is characterized by a normal ox-brain prothrombin time, normal levels
      of the vitamin-K dependent clotting factors VII and X and a proportional
      reduction of factor IX activity and antigen levels all of which is consistent
      with the cross-reacting material negative form of haemophilia B. However, in this
      family the factor IX levels in the three patients of generation V are around 1
      U/dl while the three older patients in generation III have factor IX levels
      ranging from 28 to 44 U/dl. In the oldest patient of generation V we observed a
      rise of the factor IX level from 1 U/dl up to the age of 13 to 10 U/dl at age 14.
      In addition, the older patients have very mild bleeding symptoms or none at all, 
      while the young ones have occasional spontaneous haemorrhages in muscles and
      joints, compatible with severe or moderately severe haemophilia. The disease
      appears to be similar to haemophilia B Leyden which has been described in a Dutch
      family.

AB  - The neutralization of a low molecular weight heparin (LHN-1) and conventional
      heparin (CH) by protamine sulfate has been studied in vitro and in vivo. In
      vitro, the APTT activity of CH was completely neutralized in parallel with the
      anti-Xa activity. The APTT activity of LHN-1 was almost completely neutralized in
      a way similar to the APTT activity of CH, whereas the anti-Xa activity of LHN-1
      was only partially neutralized. In vivo, CH 3 mg/kg and LHN-1 7.2 mg/kg was given
      intravenously in rats. The APTT and anti-Xa activities, after neutralization by
      protamine sulfate in vivo, were similar to the results in vitro. In CH treated
      rats no haemorrhagic effect in the rat tail bleeding test and no antithrombotic
      effect in the rat stasis model was found at a protamine sulfate to heparin ratio 
      of about 1, which neutralized APTT and anti-Xa activities. In LHN-1 treated rats 
      the haemorrhagic effect was neutralized when APTT was close to normal whereas
      higher doses of protamine sulfate were required for neutralization of the
      antithrombotic effect. This probably reflects the fact that in most experimental 
      models higher doses of heparin are needed to induce bleeding than to prevent
      thrombus formation. Our results demonstrate that even if complete neutralization 
      of APTT and anti-Xa activities were not seen in LHN-1 treated rats, the in vivo
      effects of LHN-1 could be neutralized as efficiently as those of conventional
      heparin. The large fall in blood pressure caused by high doses of protamine
      sulfate alone was prevented by the prior injection of LHN-1.

TI  - Heparin-induced osteoporosis in rats.
PG  - 293-4
AB  - In order to study the effect of heparin in inducing osteoporosis, 30 female rats 
      were divided in two groups and treated with daily injections of 2 IU heparin/g
      body weight for 33 and 65 days and compared with the same number of rats acting
      as controls. The mineral bone mass in the femora of the animals was measured
      quantitatively. A significant (p less than 0.001) reduction in bone mineral mass 
      was found in the heparin-treated animals. This effect was present to the same
      degree after 33 days as after 65 days of treatment. It is concluded that heparin 
      in this dose causes osteoporosis in rats after 33 days and that the described
      method can be used as an experimental model for further studies on this topic.

      and canine platelet density subpopulations.
PG  - 288-92
AB  - The size, total protein, fibrinogen and 5-HT content were evaluated in density
      subpopulations of human and canine platelets fractionated in linear
      arabinogalactan gradients. The methodology was assessed to ascertain that
      platelet separation was by density and to discard artifactual changes and
      platelet release during the procedure. EDTA or PGE1 increased the size of human
      PRP-platelets, but not of dog platelets. In humans, high density (HD) platelets
      were 1.26 times larger and contained 1.88 times more fibrinogen, 2.23 times more 
      5-HT and 1.37 times more protein than low density (LD) platelets; in dogs, these 
      density cohorts did not differ in protein content, but LD platelets were 1.29
      times larger and had 1.33 times more fibrinogen and 5-HT than HD platelets. These
      findings suggest that cell density is mostly dependent on the protein content per
      unit volume of platelets (and not on dense bodies). The differences in fibrinogen
      and 5-HT content between HD and LD cohorts in humans and dogs may be related to
      platelet age. The difference in volume between HD and LD platelets in dogs is of 
      uncertain interpretation.

TI  - Prolonged bleeding time, reduced platelet aggregation, altered PAF-acether
      sensitivity and increased platelet mass are a trait of asthma and hay fever.
PG  - 283-7
AB  - In a case control study 31 asymptomatic patients with asthma and/or hay fever and
      31 normal controls had their bleeding time measured using the Simplate II device 
      and venostasis. Mean bleeding time in the atopic group (527 s) was significantly 
      prolonged compared to the controls (393 s) (p less than 0.0005). Platelet
      aggregation to collagen and ADP (but not to PAF-acether) was significantly
      depressed in the atopics. Mean circulating platelet mass was significantly
      greater in atopics than in the controls (p = 0.006). Stepwise multiple regression
      analysis showed that within the control group bleeding time was best predicted by
      platelet mass (p = 0.007). No such relationship was found in the atopics. However
      stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that bleeding time in the atopics
      (but not in the controls) was best predicted by PAF-acether induced platelet
      aggregability (p less than 0.05). In neither group was bleeding time related to
      collagen induced platelet thromboxane B2 production. It is hypothesised that in
      respiratory atopy the depressed aggregatory function of platelets is not
      compensated for sufficiently by an increase in platelet mass, leading to
      prolongation of the bleeding time. This haemostatic imbalance, whose cause
      remains to be established, appears to constitute a trait of atopy.

TI  - Hepatitis-free interval after clotting factor therapy in first infused
      haemophiliacs.
PG  - 268-70
AB  - Post-infusion hepatitis is known to occur very frequently in haemophiliacs after 
      treatment with unheated commercial clotting factor concentrates, obtained from
      large plasma donation pool. On the contrary, single-donor cryoprecipitate is
      likely to carry a lower risk of transmitting hepatitis. To evaluate this
      hypothesis, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 25 first infused
      haemophiliacs (from 1981 to 1984) treated with unheated commercial clotting
      factor concentrates (n = 19) or cryoprecipitate (n = 6). The hepatitis-free
      interval after the beginning of therapy was expressed as exposure days. The end
      point of each patient, i.e. the hepatitis occurrence, was defined as an increase 
      of amino-transferases (ALT and AST) and/or the seroconversion of HBV-markers,
      which were checked every three months. The life-table method and log-rank test
      showed that cryoprecipitates had a significantly longer hepatitis-free interval
      (p = 0.0131, log-rank test) and a lower risk of transmitting hepatitis (p =
      0.01-0.05, life-table method) than the commercial concentrates. However, the
      safety of cryoprecipitate therapy was shown to cover only a few exposure days,
      and so the real advantage of this product depends on the bleeding frequency of
      the patient concerned. We believe that these methods and our findings may be
      useful to assess and compare the safety of the new "heat-treated" clotting factor
      concentrates.

TI  - Interaction of vasopressin with human blood platelets: dependency on Mg2+.
PG  - 260-2
AB  - Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) in the presence of Mg2+ but not in the absence of
      bivalent cations led to accumulation of [32P]-phosphatidic acid [( 32P]-PA) in
      human blood platelets. Mg2+ also enhanced the specific binding of [3H]-AVP to
      intact platelets. The concentrations of the cation which enabled AVP to cause
      half maximal rise of [32P]-PA and those inducing half maximal [3H]-AVP-binding
      were of the same order. It is concluded that the stimulation of phosphatidyl
      inositide breakdown by AVP in presence of Mg2+ is at least partially due to a
      Mg2+-induced enhancement of specific AVP-binding to the platelet membranes.

PG  - 693-9
AB  - The medicinal legalities of the Anhaltine territories developing under the
      influence of Enlightenment and Pietism and then characterized by philanthropism
      contain numerous progressive and for their age exemplary components. When
      comparing other relevant decrees their progressive character becomes clear by the
      accentuation of the necessities for provision of the population above all in
      rural regions. The in other places still strictly observed borders of the various
      groups of medical profession are varied according to the necessities. Earlier
      than in many other countries the representatives of surgery and pharmacy
      experience a reevaluation of the state leading to the insertion into
      medicinal-organizational authoritative bodies.

TI  - Comparison of tryptic fragments of von Willebrand factor involved in binding to
      thrombin-activated platelets with fragments involved in ristocetin-induced
      binding and binding to collagen.
PG  - 391-6
AB  - Previously we have studied the binding domains on von Willebrand factor (vWF)
      involved in ristocetin-induced binding to platelets (ristocetin binding domain,
      RBD) and in the binding of vWF to collagen (collagen binding domain, CBD) using
      tryptic fragments of 125I-labelled vWF (21, 23). We have also reported on the
      RBD, CBD and the domain on vWF involved in the binding to thrombin activated
      platelets (thrombin binding domain, TBD) using vWF-fragments prepared by
      digestion with staphylococcal protease V8 (25). In the present study, we have
      digested 125I-vWF with TPCK-trypsin and we have performed at various times of
      digestion immuno-precipitation with Mab 9, the antibody inhibiting binding of vWF
      to thrombin activated platelets. The data were compared with the
      immunoprecipitation patterns simultaneously obtained with CLB-RAg 35 which
      inhibits binding of vWF in the presence of ristocetin and with CLB-RAg 201, which
      inhibits binding of vWF to collagen. At 90 min, Mab 9 and CLB-RAg 201
      precipitated similar high molecular weight bands, whereas CLB-RAg 35 precipitated
      bands at 180 and 120 kDa. After 24 h, Mab 9 precipitated bands at 200, 155, 116
      and 85 kDa; CLB-RAg 201 precipitated a band at 48 kDa and CLB-RAg 35 a band at
      116 kDa. Two-dimensional electrophoresis demonstrated that the high molecular
      weight bands, precipitated by Mab 9 and CLB-RAg 201 at 90 min, were identical.
      The 116 kDa fragment recognized by CLB-RAg 35 had a different subunit composition
      than the 116 kDa fragment precipitated by Mab 9.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Different effects of aspirin, dipyridamole and UD-CG 115 on platelet activation
      in a model of vascular injury: studies with extracellular matrix covered with
      endothelial cells.
PG  - 333-9
AB  - Cultured endothelial cells produce an extracellular matrix (ECM) which activates 
      platelets, similarly to deendothelialized vascular segments. Platelet-rich plasma
      (PRP) was incubated with endothelial cells cultures seeded in various densities
      on ECM. The interaction of the platelets with this artificial intima was
      evaluated by phase microscopy and by thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin
      (PGI2) measurement. Large platelet aggregates were formed on exposed ECM.
      Platelets aggregation but not adhesion on the ECM was markedly inhibited by the
      presence of endothelial cells. Pretreatment of the endothelial cells with 0.1 mM 
      aspirin reduced their PGI2 synthesis and was associated with platelet aggregation
      on the ECM. 10 microM dipyridamole markedly inhibited platelet activation by ECM 
      when the drug was added to citrated whole blood before PRP preparation. UD-CG 115
      which elevates cyclic AMP in cardiac muscle, inhibited platelet aggregation and
      TXA2 production induced by ECM, in the presence as well as in the absence of
      endothelial cells, without any effect on endothelial PGI2 production.

TI  - Low molecular weight heparin (KABI 2165) as thromboprophylaxis in elective
      visceral surgery. A randomized, double-blind study versus unfractionated heparin.
PG  - 243-6
AB  - In two randomized double-blind studies perioperative bleeding complications and
      thromboembolic events were assessed in 189 patients (pts) undergoing elective
      visceral surgery after subcutaneous administration of a low molecular weight
      (LMW) heparin fragment (KABI fragment 2165) or unfractionated (UF) heparin. The
      first study comparing 1 X 7'500 anti-factor Xa IU LMW heparin daily with 2 X
      5'000 IU UF heparin was interrupted because of excessive bleeding complications
      (LMW heparin: 11/23 pts, UF heparin: 2/20 pts, p less than 0.01). In the second
      study (146 pts) the dose of LMW heparin was reduced to 1 X 2'500 anti-factor Xa
      IU. Bleeding complications (LMW heparin: 14.9%, UF heparin: 15.3%) and
      thromboembolic events (LMW heparin: 2.86%, UF heparin: 2.94%) were equal among
      the two groups. 2'500 anti-factor Xa IU/day of this LMW heparin fragment,
      corresponding to 15 mg/day, is the lowest dose of a LMW heparin used in a
      randomized clinical trial and was found to be a safe and efficient regimen in
      perioperative thrombosis prophylaxis. An advantage of LMW heparin over UF heparin
      is its once daily administration.

TI  - Gene transfer as a novel approach to the gene-controlled mechanism of the
      cellular expression of glycosphingolipids.
PG  - 91-103
AB  - Gene transfer is a useful technique to analyse the gene-controlled mechanism of
      cellular expression of glycosphingolipids. Using various oncogenes (DNA tumor
      virus oncogenes: adenovirus 12 E1 and its transcriptional subunits, myc and SV40 
      T antigens; RNA tumor retrovirus oncogens: fos, src and H-ras) for the transfer, 
      it was demonstrated that these genes invariably caused remarkable and
      characteristic changes of the cellular expression of gangliosides in the same
      recipient rat embryonic cell line, 3Y1. As a consequence of the transfer, various
      ganglioside species appeared or disappeared, the extent of the changes varying
      according to the type of oncogenes used. Analysis of the enzymatic background of 
      such changes was also carried out. Based on these results, the effects of
      oncogene transfer on glycosphingolipids were classified and discussed according
      to the mode of subcellular distribution of gene products.

TI  - Molecular interactions and thermotropic behavior of glycosphingolipids in model
      membrane systems.
PG  - 49-63
AB  - The oligosaccharide chain of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) has a marked influence on 
      their thermotropic behavior, intermolecular packing and surface electrical
      potential. The transition temperature and enthalpy of GSLs decrease
      proportionally to the complexity of the polar head group and show a linear
      dependence with the intermolecular spacings. Interactions occurring among GSLs
      and phospholipids induce changes of the molecular area and surface potential that
      depend on the type of GSLs. Increasing proportions of phospholipids perturb the
      thermodynamic properties of the GSLs up to a point where phase separated
      phospholipid domains separate out but no phase separation of pure GSLs occurs.
      Heterogeneous equilibria among different structures occur for some systems. Large
      changes of the molecular free energy, eccentricity, asymmetry ratio and phase
      state of the GSLs-containing structure can be triggered by small changes of the
      molecular parameters, lipid composition and lateral surface pressure. The
      thermotropic behavior of GSLs is considerably perturbed by myelin basic protein. 
      Phase separation occurs depending on the amount of protein and type of GSLs. The 
      protein induces a decrease of the lipid molecular area, the more so the more
      complex the oligosaccharide chain in the GSLs. These membrane systems can not be 
      described only on the basis of the individual properties of the molecules
      involved in a simple causal manner. Still scarcely explored long range
      thermodynamic, geometric and field effects that belong simultaneously to the
      intervening molecules, to the morphological properties of the structure involved 
      and to the aqueous environment, are important determinants of their behavior.

TI  - New chemical trends in ganglioside research.
PG  - 3-26
AB  - A report is given of recent progress in the methodology for isolation of
      gangliosides from natural sources, for the preparation of molecular species of
      gangliosides homogeneous in both the oligosaccharide and ceramide portions of the
      molecule, for chemical manipulation and derivatization of gangliosides, and for
      the preparation of gangliosides radiolabelled in different parts of the molecule.
      Particular emphasis has been given to: high performance liquid chromatographic
      procedures capable to separate gangliosides on the basis of their oligosaccharide
      or ceramide moieties and yielding completely homogeneous compounds, that is
      gangliosides with a single oligosaccharide, a single long chain base and a single
      fatty acid; two-dimensional thin-layer chromatographic procedures, provided with 
      a fully computerized quantification system, particularly suitable to identifying 
      gangliosides containing alkali-labile linkages, including ganglioside lactones;
      chemical procedures of high yield for reducing gangliosides at the double bond of
      long chain base, for selective removal of the fatty acyl moiety and replacement
      with a novel fatty acid, and for the synthesis of ganglioside lactones; chemical 
      procedures for inserting fluorescent, paramagnetic or photoreactive probes at the
      fatty acyl part of the ganglioside molecule; procedures for chemical isotopic
      radiolabelling of gangliosides at the level of sialic acid acetyl group and at
      the fatty acid moiety. Examples are provided evidencing the significance and
      potential use of a variety of ganglioside derivatives in the study of ganglioside
      metabolism and functional implications.

PG  - 27-48
AB  - The primary structure of the oligosaccharide moiety of a glycosphingolipid can be
      elucidated by employing high-field proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
      spectroscopy. Information with respect to the composition and configuration of
      its sugar residues, and the sequence and linkage sites of the oligosaccharide
      chain can be obtained by employing a variety of one- and two-dimensional
      techniques. The latter include both scalar and dipolar correlated two-dimensional
      NMR spectroscopy. These techniques are also useful in establishing the solution
      conformation (secondary structure) of the oligosaccharide moiety. Examples in
      utilizing these techniques in elucidating the primary and secondary structures of
      glycolipids are presented.

TI  - Sulfatide-binding proteins.
PG  - 173-83
AB  - Sulfatides (galactosyl ceramide-I3-sulfate) and other sulfated glycolipids are
      found in many tissues. The cell adhesion proteins laminin, thrombospondin, and
      von Willebrand factor bind specifically to sulfated glycolipids. Methods for
      characterizing the specificity of these interactions using surface-adsorbed
      glycolipids are reviewed. The three proteins do not bind to other anionic lipids,
      including gangliosides, phospholipids, or cholesterol 3-sulfate. Binding to
      sulfatides is saturable and of relatively high affinity. Relative binding avidity
      depends on the oligosaccharide structure of the glycolipids. Binding to
      sulfatides in erythrocyte membranes can account for the hemagglutinating
      activities of the three proteins and may play a role in the interactions of these
      proteins with other cell types.

TI  - Phylogenetic development of myelin glycosphingolipids.
PG  - 117-28
AB  - Myelin is a highly specialized membrane, which enwraps axons and facilitates
      saltatory nerve conduction in vertebrates. Galactocerebroside and its sulfate
      ester, sulfatide, are highly localized in myelin. To understand the role played
      by these galactosphingolipids we investigated the changes of these
      myelin-specific compounds during the course of the evolution of myelin. We found 
      that urodele nerve myelin lacks alpha-hydroxy fatty acid-containing
      galactosphingolipids. Our morphological and physiological studies of urodele
      nerves indicated that these hydroxy fatty acid-containing galactosphingolipids
      probably contribute to fast nerve conduction. Also it is suspected that they are 
      involved in the regulation of the thickness of myelin in relation to the size of 
      the axon. In another study, we discovered that glucocerebroside, which has
      glucose instead of galactose as its carbohydrate component, is abundantly present
      in the myelin-like sheath membrane of crustacean nerves. Subsequently, the
      phylogenetic study indicated that galactocerebrosides were limited to the nervous
      system of deuterostomes, while all protostome nerves contain glucocerebrosides.
      The role of glucocerebrosides in multilayered membranes and in the conduction
      velocity of the protostome nervous system is discussed.

TI  - Regulation of GM2 ganglioside metabolism in cultured cells.
PG  - 105-16
AB  - GM2-ganglioside (II3NeuAcGgOse3Cer) is a minor component of adult nervous tissue,
      but is probably an oncofetal antigen. Its biological role is unknown, but several
      lines of evidence indicate its potential role in cell adhesion both in the retina
      and in oligodendrocytes. The biosynthesis of GM2-ganglioside appears to be
      tightly regulated, since it is a key intermediate in complex ganglioside
      synthesis. The specific GM3: hexosaminyl-transferase is activated under
      conditions which activate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and cell
      transformation with retroviruses inactivates it. Catabolism of GM2 requires the
      concerted action of three gene products (alpha-chain, beta-chain and activator
      protein in a thermolabile alpha beta 2 AP complex referred to as HexA). Defects
      in either three components results in the neuronal storage of GM2 ganglioside and
      the manifestations of Tay-Sachs Disease in children or motor neuron disease in
      adults.

TI  - Selection by genetic complementation and characterization of the gene coding for 
      the yeast porphobilinogen deaminase.
PG  - 673-7
AB  - The porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been
      isolated by genetic complementation of a mutant GL7 (alpha hem 3) strain,
      previously shown to be defective in this haembiosynthetic enzyme [Gollub, Liu,
      Dayan, Adlersberg & Sprinson (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2846-2854]. The gene was 
      selected from a yeast wild-type genomic DNA library ligated into the shuttle
      vector YEp13. The complementing gene restored growth of the hem 3 (PBG-D) mutant 
      strain on media in the absence of exogeneous haem or fatty acid and sterol
      supplements. The recombinant plasmid was retained in the Hem+ transformant
      provided that selective pressure for plasmid-dependent growth was maintained.
      Transformation of the mutant strain (hem 3) restored the PBG-D activity to levels
      up to 10-fold those of the parental strain. The mutant strain GL7 does not show
      any measurable enzymic activity. Analysis of the plasmid designated YEpPBG-D
      (containing the PBG-D gene) by hybrid-selected translation revealed that it
      contained the coding information for a single protein of apparent Mr 43,000. The 
      coding region was localized on an 1.5 kb endonuclease-EcoRI fragment (E4), within
      the 5.5 kb genomic insert in YEpPBG-D.

TI  - Response of muscle protein turnover to insulin after acute exercise and training.
PG  - 651-7
AB  - To determine whether the enhanced insulin-sensitivity of glucose metabolism in
      muscle after acute exercise also extends to protein metabolism, untrained and
      exercise-trained rats were subjected to an acute bout of exercise, and the
      responses of protein synthesis and degradation to insulin were measured in
      epitrochlearis muscles in vitro. Acute exercise of both untrained and trained
      rats decreased protein synthesis in muscle in the absence or presence of insulin,
      but protein degradation was not altered. Exercise training alone had no effect on
      protein synthesis or degradation in muscle in the absence or presence of insulin.
      Acute exercise or training alone enhanced the sensitivities of both protein
      synthesis and degradation to insulin, but the enhanced insulin-sensitivities from
      training alone were not additive to those after acute exercise. These results
      indicate that: a decrease in protein synthesis is the primary change in muscle
      protein turnover after acute exercise and is not altered by prior exercise
      training, and the enhanced insulin-sensitivities of metabolism of both glucose
      and protein after either acute exercise or training suggest post-binding receptor
      events.

TI  - Effect of ethanol on the thermal stability of tRNA molecules.
PG  - 181-90
AB  - The thermal denaturation of E. coli unfractionated tRNA in ethanol/water mixtures
      has been studied as a function of alcohol concentration in the water-rich region 
      (mole fraction of co-solvent chi 2 less than 0.2). The results show that with
      increasing alcohol concentration the melting temperature of tRNA first reaches a 
      minimum at an intermediate composition chi *2 approximately equal to 0.055 and
      then increases with increasing chi 2. The value of chi *2 is close to that at
      which structural changes in the mixture occur as inferred from compressibility
      and optical absorption measurements. The present experimental data support the
      assumptions that the dominant mechanism by which ethanol affects the thermal
      stability of tRNA molecules is through its effect on the structure of water.

PG  - 151-60
AB  - The specificity of indicators that depend on elevated incubation temperature as a
      selective factor for their enumeration was questioned because of the possibility 
      of interference from autochthonous microorganisms adapted to high ambient
      temperatures. Lactose-fermenting cultures isolated from fecal coliform tests of
      tropical marine surface waters were identified as consisting of about 70%
      Escherichia coli, and most of the remaining cultures being Klebsiella,
      Enterobacter or Citrobacter species. This confirmed the taxonomic specificity of 
      fecal coliform tests for these waters. Fecal and total coliforms, fecal
      streptococcus, heterotrophic bacteria and yeast counts had correlations of above 
      99% confidence levels with most other microbial and chemical parameters studied. 
      Waters with fecal coliform counts above 1000 per 100 ml had increased incidence
      of presumptive pathogenic yeasts, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella. Our data
      support the use of coliforms or fecal streptococci as indicators of recent fecal 
      pollution in tropical marine waters and yeast or heterotrophic bacteria counts as
      complementary indicator methods for these waters.

      patients].
PG  - 2235-41
AB  - The immunoenzyme method was used to measure serum ferritin levels in 55 patients 
      with haemolymphopathies and advanced solid tumours. Patients were divided into
      five groups according to tumour type. 50 healthy subjects and 12 patients with
      cirrhosis of the liver were also studied. In 76% of the cancer patients ferritin 
      levels were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy subjects (p
      less than 0.01). Only 8 of the patients studied had primary or secondary liver
      tumours. None of the cancer patients showed clinical or blood chemical signs of
      current acute or chronic liver disease. Furthermore 13 of the cancer patients had
      severe anaemia and were given multiple transfusions during hospitalisation. All
      the groups studied showed a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in mean
      ferritinaemia levels compared to the healthy control groups. There was also a
      significant difference between the mean value encountered in the liver cancer and
      cirrhosis groups. Both groups also showed significantly higher levels than the
      control group. In contrast no significant differences were noted between the mean
      values encountered in the individual cancer groups by means of variance analysis.

TI  - Assay of human pancreatic lipase in biological fluids using a non-competitive
      enzyme immunoassay.
PG  - 209-19
AB  - A sandwich enzyme immunoassay has been developed for human pancreatic lipase
      using polystyrene balls coated with specific IgG as the first antibody and
      peroxidase-labelled IgG as the second antibody. The detection limit was 0.5
      microgram/l. Good parallelism was observed with the curves obtained from standard
      lipase and lipase present in serum, pancreatic juice and duodenal contents,
      demonstrating that the assay may be used to measure the level of the protein in
      different biological fluids. Mean values of lipase in human sera were 12.3 +/-
      6.8 micrograms/l in adults and 4.5 +/- 2.7 in newborns. In all cases a good
      correlation was found in serum between the catalytic activity and the enzyme
      immunoassay. Lipase is detectable in amniotic fluids at the 18th week of
      pregnancy but at a very low level (0.95 +/- 0.32 microgram/l). In pancreatic
      juices, lipase concentration was 14.6% of the total protein content. A study on
      cystic fibrosis patients showed a poor correlation between blood pancreatic
      lipase concentration and fat malabsorption underlying the difficulty in assessing
      pancreatic function by the measurement of serum pancreatic enzymes. The use of
      the lipase assay in duodenal contents would permit better assessment of
      pancreatic function in patients presenting a severe or borderline defect in fat
      digestion and absorption.

TI  - Non-specific binding of insulin in an equilibrium binding assay of insulin
      antibodies.
PG  - 147-55
AB  - In liquid phase assays for insulin binding antibodies (IBA), total binding of
      insulin is composed of specific and non-specific binding (NSB). Sometimes NSB is 
      determined in serum of healthy individuals and then subtracted from total binding
      of IBA positive serum to obtain specific binding. This method does not take into 
      account that NSB might vary from plasma to plasma. This possibility was
      investigated by means of a computerised non-linear curve fitting routine for the 
      evaluation of measurement results of an (equilibrium) binding assay for IBA,
      which yields estimates of NSB for each plasma individually. From each of 19
      insulin treated diabetic patients, 4 blood samples, taken at different points in 
      time, were available for IBA and NSB measurement. It was found that inter-patient
      variance of NSB exceeded within-patient variance (p less than 0.01) and, in a
      number of instances, within-patient variance was greater than experimental
      variance. Our results indicate that it is advisable to use methods of IBA
      evaluation that take these NSB variations into account.

TI  - In vitro formation of amyloid fibrils from two synthetic peptides of different
      lengths homologous to Alzheimer's disease beta-protein.
PG  - 782-9
AB  - Two synthetic peptides corresponding to the reported 28-residue sequence of
      Alzheimer's Disease beta-protein (SP28) and to residues 12-28 (SP17) were used to
      form fibrils in vitro. Synthetic fibrils bound Congo Red and closely resembled
      amyloid fibrils isolated from leptomeninges and senile plaques of Alzheimer's
      brain by electron microscopy. A polyclonal antiserum to SP28 specifically
      decorated both synthetic and native amyloid by colloidal gold immunoelectron
      microscopy. Amyloid fibrils isolated from tissue were insoluble on
      SDS-Polyacrylamide gels, and tended to aggregate while synthetic amyloid fibrils 
      were completely solubilized, releasing only monomers of SP28 and SP17. Anti-SP28 
      immunostained cerebrovascular and plaque core amyloid, but not neurofibrillary
      tangles, in tissue section. Western blot analysis showed that anti-SP28 reacted
      with a 4 kDa band released from amyloid core-enriched preparations and
      leptomeninges. By contrast, a 16 kDa band corresponding to the tetramer of
      beta-protein was not recognized. These data suggest that as little as a 17
      residue sequence of beta-protein may be required to form fibrils and that the
      complete sequence of the 4 kDa beta-protein may be important in determining
      insolubility and the formation of intermediate size polymers.

TI  - The two binding sites for DCMU in Photosystem II.
PG  - 682-8
AB  - Measurements on the fluorescence induction of Triton X-100 extracted Photosystem 
      II (PSII) particles confirmed the existence of the two sites of inhibition in
      PSII for the herbicide DCMU. The two sites were located on the reducing and
      oxidizing sides of PSII, respectively. The inhibition on the oxidizing side,
      unlike that on the reducing side which was of the "none or all" type, was found
      only to slow down the electron donation at low concentrations of DCMU. The
      results also suggested that the inhibitions of DCMU at these two sites were
      mutually exclusive, i.e., the binding on one site prevented the binding on the
      other site.

TI  - Interaction between actin and HMM.
PG  - 541-6
AB  - It is shown that the interaction between actin and HMM results in a rapid
      precipitation of acto-HMM gel upon addition of MgATP. This is a simple
      demonstration of the idea that the formation of myosin filaments is not essential
      for mechanochemical reaction (muscle contraction) to occur and that the soluble
      myosin heads are competent to interact with actin to produce mechanical effect.
      Our findings also strongly support earlier suggestion that each head of one HMM
      molecule is able to bind to a different actin filament.

AB  - Tissues from human fetuses of 12-18 weeks gestational age were examined for
      expression of c-oncogenes. Dot blot hybridization showed that N-ras and C-H-ras
      were expressed to varying degrees in all tissues. Some of the tissues were
      further examined by Northern blot hybridization, and transcripts of approximately
      2.2 Kb and 5.2 Kb were detected using N-ras cDNA probe. A further transcript of
      approximately 1.4 Kb was observed when the same blot was hybridized to C-H-ras
      cDNA probe. No hybridization was detected between the fetal tissues and c-K-ras,

TI  - Receptor-mediated photo-cytotoxicity: synthesis of a photoactivatable psoralen
      derivative conjugated to insulin.
PG  - 502-9
AB  - 4'-Aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen has been chemically conjugated to insulin
      using a carbodiimide derivative. The psoralen moiety retains its photochemical
      reactivity as evidenced by its ability to crosslink DNA after exposure to long
      wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm). This chimeric molecule has been
      used to selectively kill a population of lymphocytes whose expression of insulin 
      receptors has been stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Insulin carries the
      psoralen into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis, where it is
      subsequently activated by exposure to UVA light. The UVA induced activity of
      AMT-insulin can be blocked by the presence of native insulin. The viability of
      unstimulated lymphocytes was not affected by AMT-insulin and UVA light. The
      hybrid insulin-psoralen molecule may be a prototype for a family of phototoxic
      drugs which can be selectively delivered to subsets of lymphocytes.

TI  - Induction of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde reductase by phenobarbital in primary culture 
      of rat hepatocytes.
PG  - 488-93
AB  - When rats were treated with phenobarbital (PB), the activity of CBA reductase,
      which catalyzes the conversion of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde (CBA) to
      2-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMB), in the liver was markedly enhanced. Likewise, 
      addition of PB to the primary culture of rat hepatocytes increased the activity
      of CBA reductase. The enzyme recovered from cell lysate of cultured cells showed 
      the same characteristics in molecular and catalytic properties as the enzyme
      purified from the livers of the rats treated with PB. Experiments with
      cycloheximide suggest that de novo synthesis of the enzyme protein is enhanced by
      PB in primary culture.

TI  - Cachectin/TNF as well as interleukin-1 induces prostacyclin synthesis in cultured
      vascular endothelial cells.
PG  - 482-7
AB  - Cachectin/tumor necrosis factor (cachectin/TNF) has been shown to be capable of
      stimulating prostacyclin (PGI2) production by vascular endothelial cells in
      vitro. The stimulation of PGI2 by cachectin/TNF is comparable to that observed
      with interleukin-1, the monokine previously suggested to be the principal
      mediator of this effect. The ability of cachectin/TNF to stimulate PGI2
      production suggests that it may play a role in producing depressed blood pressure
      or shock. If so, it might be possible to prevent such adverse effects with the
      aid of anti-inflammatory agents.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers in the management of hypertension in the elderly.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - Calcium channel blockers seem to be particularly suitable for elderly
      hypertensive patients since these agents do not cause salt and fluid retention,
      postural hypotension, sedation, depression, or biochemical abnormalities.
      Moreover, their use is compatible with several common diseases of old age, such
      as diabetes, obstructive lung disease, and peripheral vascular disease. We
      recently conducted a study in 21 patients (average age, 79 +/- 2 years) who
      completed an eight-week trial with 20-mg nifedipine tablets taken twice daily.
      Mean blood pressure decreased from 191 +/- 2/96 +/- 2 mm Hg to 151 +/- 4/80 +/- 3
      mm Hg. In 15 patients (71 percent), blood pressure decreased to less than or
      equal to 160/90 mm Hg; in four additional patients (19 percent), diastolic blood 
      pressure decreased by 15 to 25 percent. Thus, there was a sustained lowering of
      blood pressure in 90 percent of the participants receiving nifedipine
      monotherapy. A review of recent studies in elderly hypertensive patients revealed
      similarly favorable results with calcium channel blockers given alone or in
      combination with other agents. The accumulating data suggest that these compounds
      may offer a useful new approach to the treatment of hypertension in old age.
      However, in these studies, the number of patients and the duration of follow-up
      need to be extended to confirm the favorable impression obtained thus far.

TI  - Monotherapy of mild hypertension with nifedipine.
PG  - 20-4
AB  - The effectiveness of nifedipine as first-line monotherapy for mild diastolic
      hypertension (range: 95 to 105 mm Hg) was tested in this placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, randomized trial. Fifty-six patients were enrolled and, after
      titration of the placebo or active drug, they were followed for 12 weeks.
      Significant declines in the sitting systolic and diastolic pressures of -19 +/- 4
      mm Hg (standard error) and -13 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, were observed during
      this follow-up period. Overall, 75 percent of patients receiving active drug had 
      diastolic pressures less than or equal to 90 mm Hg at the last treatment visit.
      Heart rate was not significantly changed in the sitting position during the
      treatment period, and the majority of patients (75 percent) showed a response to 
      nifedipine doses of 10 or 20 mg orally three times daily in the capsule form. The
      levels of the systolic and diastolic pressures at entry were not predictive of
      the dose of nifedipine required for effective blood pressure control.

PG  - 99-109
AB  - The evidence for a role for thiomolybdates in the important ruminant disease
      syndromes of molybdenosis and Mo-induced hypocuprosis is outlined and present
      knowledge of their chemistry and metabolism in vivo is reviewed in an attempt to 
      provide a less empirical basis for their toxicology. The compounds are novel
      enzyme inhibitors in vitro and have also been used therapeutically, apparently
      successfully, in the treatment of Wilson's disease. While the changes which occur
      in vivo are complex they can be best understood in terms of an alteration in the 
      affinities for copper of some of the competing ligands, including albumin, which 
      leads to a change in the distribution of copper between the different systemic
      pools and an overall depletion.

TI  - Usefulness of Ficoll in electric field-mediated cell fusion.
PG  - 2279-88
AB  - Electrofusion is a technique that enables the production of new cell types with
      desired properties to be done. Ehrlich ascites tumor cells are fused by means of 
      an electric field. Under too harsh external field strength or pulse length
      conditions, however, membrane breakdown leads to a loss of cellular cytoplasm.
      Addition of the high polymer Ficoll to the fusion medium increases its density
      and osmotic pressure, thus preventing cytoplasm from running out and, therefore, 
      maintaining cell viability. Fusion between cells of different sizes is made
      possible or facilitated by means of Ficoll, as big cells do not lose their
      cytoplasm under conditions required for enhancing membrane permeability of the
      small cells. In presence of the proteolytic enzyme pronase, addition of Ficoll to
      the fusion medium further raises the fusion percentage compared to the exclusive 
      addition of pronase. The fusion of cells of different densities is also greatly
      facilitated and its percentage increased by addition of Ficoll, thus obviating
      the necessity to perform electrofusion under conditions of microgravity.

TI  - Free radicals: a potential pathogenic mechanism in inherited muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 2271-8
AB  - Despite years of intensive work, the biochemical defect responsible for the
      pathogenesis of inherited muscular dystrophy has not been identified either in
      humans or animal models. This review examines evidence in support of the
      hypothesis that free radicals may be responsible for muscle degeneration in this 
      disorder. A variety of cellular abnormalities noted in dystrophic muscles can be 
      accounted for by free radical mediated damage. In addition, chemical by-products 
      associated with free radical damage are found in dystrophic muscle tissue from
      humans and animals with this disease. Various enzymatic antioxidant systems can
      be enhanced as a normal cellular response to oxidative stress, and such changes
      are seen both in dystrophic muscle cells and certain other tissues of dystrophic 
      animals. An increased level of free radical damage would follow from either:
      enhanced production of free radical species, or a deficient component of the
      cellular antioxidant system, such as vitamin E. The free radical hypothesis of
      muscular dystrophy can account for data supporting several alternative theories
      of the pathogenesis of this disease, as well as other observations which have not
      previously been explained.

TI  - Distribution of noradrenaline in the brain of the teleost Gasterosteus aculeatus 
      L.: an immunohistochemical analysis.
PG  - 297-313
AB  - The distribution of noradrenergic neurons in the brain of the three-spined
      stickleback was demonstrated with the indirect peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP)
      immunohistochemical method with antibodies against a noradrenaline-bovine serum
      albumin conjugate. Noradrenergic neuronal somata were exclusively located in the 
      isthmal area of the brain stem and in the lower medulla. Noradrenergic varicose
      axons innervate the reticular formation, motor nuclei, and interpeduncular
      nucleus of the brain stem, the hypothalamus and habenular nuclei, various parts
      of the area dorsalis telencephali (forebrain pallium), and the olfactory bulbs.
      Scattered noradrenergic axons were observed in the optic tectum and in various
      parts of the cerebellum. It is concluded that the isthmal cell group of the
      stickleback is, on topological and cytoarchitectonic grounds, equivalent to the
      ventral portion of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area of amniotes, but that
      its efferent connections display features characteristic both of those
      originating in the locus coeruleus, and in the lateral tegmental cell groups of
      mammals.

TI  - Pregnancy diagnosis in swine: a comparison of the accuracies of mechanical and
      endocrine tests with return to estrus.
PG  - 1567-71
AB  - The relative accuracies of various commercially available detection procedures in
      the evaluation of pregnancy status were evaluated in 51 sows of mixed parity.
      Sows were mated 1 to 3 times during estrus to one or more boars. A blood sample
      was obtained from each sow between 19 and 23 days after estrus (first day of
      estrus = day 1) and again between 26 and 30 days and was analyzed by
      radioimmunoassay for content of progesterone and estrone sulfate, respectively.
      Sows were considered pregnant if progesterone concentrations were greater than 5 
      ng/ml and if estrone sulfate concentrations were greater than 0.5 ng/ml. At daily
      intervals, sows were exposed to mature, sexually aggressive boars and observed
      for signs of estrus. Between 31 and 35 days of gestation, sows were evaluated for
      pregnancy by use of the following mechanical devices: a Doppler ultrasound
      pregnancy detector fitted with an abdominal probe, the Doppler detector with a
      rectal probe, an amplitude-depth ultrasound pregnancy detector (diode ruler), and
      another amplitude-depth ultrasound detector from a different manufacturer
      (oscilloscope). Relative to the proportion of sows that farrowed, the overall
      accuracies of the techniques were returns to estrus, 98%; estrone sulfate, 92%;
      progesterone, 92%; Doppler with rectal probe, 86%; Doppler with abdominal probe, 
      86%; diode ruler amplitude-depth ultrasound, 73%; and oscilloscope
      amplitude-depth ultrasound, 86%. Estrus detection resulted in the lowest
      prevalence of sows that were predicted to farrow, but did not subsequently farrow
      (false-positive diagnoses) and the lowest prevalence of sows that were not
      predicted to farrow, but subsequently did farrow (false-negative
      diagnoses).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to ras, sis, erb-B, src, myb and myc oncoproteins
      were evaluated for their potential to target anti-cancer drugs to malignant
      cells. Each antibody was tested for reactivity against both fixed and viable
      cultured human tumour cells by immunofluorescence, and all reacted against a
      variety of fixed tumour cell preparations. Reactions were also observed against
      fixed non-malignant cells. None, however, reacted significantly with viable
      cells. Two antibodies (against ras and myc proteins) were tested for their
      ability to localize to tumour xenografts in nude mice, and conjugates were
      constructed by linking these antibodies to methotrexate using human serum albumin
      as an intermediate carrier. Neither antibody localized to tumour in vivo, and the
      methotrexate conjugates were not significantly cytotoxic for tumour cells in
      vitro, in contrast to similar conjugates simultaneously prepared with a proven
      anti-tumour MAb (791T/36). It was concluded that currently available MAbs to
      oncogene proteins are not suitable vectors for targeting cytotoxic agents to
      tumour cells.

TI  - The polar head group of a novel insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid mimics
      insulin action on phospholipid methyltransferase.
PG  - 238-42
AB  - A phospholipid has been purified from rat liver membranes which copurified with
      an insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid isolated from H35 hepatoma cells. The
      polar head group of this phospholipid was generated by treatment with a
      phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus and
      purified through a C18 extraction column. Like insulin, the addition of this
      polar head group to isolated rat adipocytes inhibited the stimulatory effect of
      isoproterenol on phospholipid methyltransferase. The polar head group was also
      active on a subcellular fraction. The addition of the polar head group to
      microsomes isolated from isoproterenol-treated adipocytes produced a
      time-dependent inactivation of phospholipid methyltransferase, approaching basal 
      activity. It is proposed that the effects of insulin on phospholipid
      methyltransferase may be mediated by this polar head group.

PG  - 235-7
AB  - A series of tetrapeptides, Cbz(Bz)-Gly-X-Leu-Gly, were synthesized and the
      kinetic parameters, kcat and kcat/Km, determined for their hydrolyses by prolyl
      endopeptidase from Flavobacterium. The peptides with X = N-Me-Ala, Sar and Ala as
      well as the standard substrate (X = Pro) were found to be good substrates, while 
      those with X = alpha-aminobutyryl, Hyp, Ser and Gly were poor substrates, and
      those with X = pipecolyl, alpha-aminoisobutyryl, N-Me-Val, N-Me-Leu, Hyp(O-Bzl)
      and Ser(O-Bzl) were not cleaved at all. These results suggest that the
      specificity-determining site or S1 subsite of the enzyme is designed to fit
      exactly the proline residue of the substrate with allowance for the residues
      carrying substituents at the N and/or C alpha which must not exceed the size of
      the pyrrolidine ring of proline.

TI  - Partial purification of the maturation-promoting factor MPF from unfertilized
      eggs of Xenopus laevis.
PG  - 771-7
AB  - A 200-fold purification of the maturation-promoting factor or MPF from
      unfertilized eggs of Xenopus laevis is reported for the first time. Purification 
      was achieved by three successive column chromatographies on hydroxyapatite,
      trisacryl blue and L-arginine-agarose. The presence of MPF was assessed by the
      usual maturation criteria after injections of test material into immature stage
      VI unstimulated X. laevis oocytes: the precocious appearance of the maturation
      spot (within 45-120 min), the germinal vesicle breakdown, the presence of the
      first polar body and the second metaphase spindle. Purification was monitored by 
      the decrease of the minimal amount of protein injected in a constant volume (50
      nl) required to induce 50% frequency of germinal vesicle breakdown. This amount
      decreased from 500 ng in the crude extract to 2.5 ng in the 200-fold purified
      material. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the crude extract showed about 40
      Coomassie-blue-stained polypeptides with molecular masses ranging from 300 kDa to
      20 kDa, whereas in the 200-fold purified MPF only 5 stained polypeptides were
      revealed, with molecular masses of 62, 53, 49, 39 and 37 kDa. In vitro
      phosphorylations for the detection of kinase activities for endogenous and
      exogenous substrates were monitored by analysis of autoradiograms of SDS-PAGE,
      after treatment of fractions with [gamma-32P]ATP. Only inactive fractions eluted 
      from columns ahead of MPF, and fractions containing MPF activity were tested.
      Phosphorylation of numerous stained polypeptides was demonstrated in the crude
      MPF extract and exogenous substrates such as phosvitin, casein and histone type
      II-AS were also strongly phosphorylated. In the MPF fraction, purified on
      hydroxyapatite, a polypeptide of 53 kDa was more highly and specifically
      phosphorylated and the presence of kinase activities was observed for the above
      three exogenous substrates. In the 100-fold and 200-fold purified MPF,
      phosphorylation of endogenous substrates could not be shown and kinase activities
      for the above three substrates were drastically decreased as compared with the
      crude and purified MPF obtained after hydroxyapatite column chromatography.
      However, neither endogenous phosphorylations nor kinase activities with the above
      exogenous substrates could be shown in inactive fractions eluted ahead of MPF at 
      the different purification steps. Some characteristics of the purified material
      are also described in this paper.

PG  - 739-47
AB  - Calcium/calmodulin-dependent multifunctional protein kinases, extensively
      purified from rat brain (with apparent molecular mass 640 kDa), rabbit liver (300
      kDa) and rabbit skeletal muscle (700 kDa), were analysed for their structural,
      immunological, and enzymatic properties. The immunological cross-reactivity with 
      affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to the 50-kDa catalytic subunit of the
      brain calmodulin-dependent protein kinase confirmed the presence of common
      antigenic determinants in all subunits of the protein kinases. One-dimensional
      phosphopeptide patterns, obtained by digestion of the autophosphorylated protein 
      kinases with S. aureus V8 protease, and two-dimensional fingerprints of the
      125I-labelled proteins digested with a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin,
      revealed a close similarity between the two subunits (51 kDa and 53 kDa) of the
      liver enzyme. Similar identity was observed between the 56-kDa and/or 58-kDa
      polypeptides of the skeletal muscle calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The data
      suggest that the subunits of the liver and muscle protein kinases may be derived 
      by partial proteolysis or by autophosphorylation. The peptide patterns for the
      50-kDa and 60-kDa subunits of the brain enzyme confirmed that the two catalytic
      subunits represented distinct protein products. The comparison of the
      phosphopeptide maps and the two-dimensional peptide fingerprints, indicated
      considerable structural homology among the 50-kDa and 60-kDa subunits of the
      brain calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and the liver and muscle polypeptides. 
      However, a significant number of unique peptides in the liver 51-kDa subunit,
      skeletal muscle 56-kDa, and the brain 50-kDa and 60-kDa polypeptides were
      observed and suggest the existence of isoenzyme forms. All calmodulin-dependent
      protein kinases rapidly phosphorylated synapsin I with a stoichiometry of 3-5 mol
      phosphate/mol protein. The two-dimensional separation of phosphopeptides obtained
      by tryptic/chymotryptic digestion of 32P-labelled synapsin I indicated that the
      same peptides were phosphorylated by all the calmodulin-dependent protein
      kinases. Such data represent the first structural and immunological comparison of
      the liver calmodulin-dependent protein kinase with the enzymes isolated from
      brain and skeletal muscle. The findings indicate the presence of a family of
      highly conserved calmodulin-dependent multifunctional protein kinases, with
      similar structural, immunological and enzymatic properties. The individual
      catalytic subunits appear to represent the expression of distinct protein
      products or isoenzymes which are selectively expressed in mammalian tissues.

TI  - Amino-acid sequence data of beta-tubulin from Physarum polycephalum myxamoebae.
PG  - 669-79
AB  - Starting with 7.7 mg of a beta-tubulin isolated from myxamoebae of the slime
      mould Physarum polycephalum, 90% of the sequence has been determined by the Edman
      degradation of peptides generated by cyanogen bromide, trypsin and Staphylococcus
      aureus protease. Differences to other beta-tubulins are mainly conservative and
      spread evenly throughout the chain except for a high concentration at the
      C-terminus. The Physarum beta-tubulin shows most homology to Chlamydomonas
      beta-tubulin (90.5%) and least homology to yeast beta-tubulin (S. cerevisiae,
      73.4%). Two tryptic peptides were isolated in approximately equal quantities
      which were identical except in one position (S/ALTVPELTQRMFDA) showing that at
      least two beta-tubulins are present in myxamoebae. However, since this was the
      only heterogeneity found, these beta-tubulins are probably very similar.

TI  - Characterization of the elongation factors from calf brain. 1. Purification,
      molecular and immunological properties.
PG  - 635-45
AB  - This work describes a method for the purification of the elongation factors (EF) 
      from calf brain. The elongation factor responsible for the binding of
      aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome is found in this organ as a light form (EF-1
      alpha) and as a component of heavy, polydispersed aggregates (EF-1H). EF-1 beta, 
      the factor enhancing the EF-1 alpha GDP/GTP exchange, is part of EF-1H and of
      smaller aggregates. The fraction of EF-1 alpha and EF-1 beta not associated with 
      EF-1H, and EF-2 have been purified to homogeneity after several chromatographic
      steps. EF-1H consists of many proteins; among them, EF-1 alpha, EF-1 beta and an 
      EF-1 gamma-like protein represent three of the major components. This
      conclusively shows that EF-1H from calf brain is not a polydispersed aggregate of
      only EF-1 alpha. EF-1 beta has also been purified to homogeneity from EF-1H. The 
      property of EF-1 beta to aggregate with other proteins suggests that this factor 
      plays an important role in the organization of EF-1H. The relative molecular mass
      of the purified factors have been determined as: EF-1 alpha, 50,000; EF-1 beta,
      30,000; the EF-1 gamma-like component, 49,000; EF-2, 85,000. Some
      cross-reactivity with the antibodies against the prokaryotic counterparts has
      been shown for EF-1 alpha, EF-1 beta and EF-2 by functional and
      immuno-precipitation methods, suggesting the existence of structural homologies.

TI  - Ferredoxin reductase levels in the ovaries of pigs and superovulated rats during 
      follicular cell growth and luteinization.
PG  - 629-33
AB  - The concentration of ferredoxin reductase, a component of the mitochondrial
      steroidogenic electron transport chain, was measured in the ovaries of pigs and
      superovulated rats by a protein blotting procedure using polyclonal antibodies to
      the purified protein. The concentration of ferredoxin reductase in porcine
      granulosa cells doubled during growth of follicles from small (1-2 mm diameter)
      to large (6-12 mm diameter). The concentration doubled again during the period of
      luteinization. This is in contrast to the rate of cholesterol side-chain
      cleavage, which showed little change during follicular growth but increased by
      more than tenfold during luteinization. A similar large increase in cholesterol
      side-chain cleavage occurs during the period of luteinization in the ovaries of
      superovulated rats, but as for the pig, only a small increase in ferredoxin
      reductase was observed. A threefold increase in the yield of mitochondrial
      protein from tissue homogenates was found between the granulosa cells of
      small-medium follicles and the cells of the corpora luteum. The increase in
      ferredoxin reductase during follicular development and luteinization, therefore, 
      correlates well with the increase in mitochondria in the cells, but does not
      correlate with the dramatic increase in cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity 
      which occurs during luteinization. Based on these results, it is unlikely that
      the level of ferredoxin reductase limits the expression of the full steroidogenic
      activity of the granulosa cells of the ovary.

TI  - Hexokinase PII from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by changes in the
      cytosolic Mg2+-free ATP concentration.
PG  - 565-9
AB  - Hexokinase PII is not inhibited by high Mg-ATP concentrations if the Mg2+-free
      ATP is kept at low levels (0.01 mM) in the assay mixture. Hexokinase PI activity 
      is not affected either by Mg2+-free ATP nor by free Mg2+ in the assay mixture.
      Thus, hexokinase PI and PII activities appear not to be regulated by substrate
      inhibition as proposed previously [Kopetzki, E. & Entian, K. D. (1985) Eur. J.
      Biochem. 146, 657-662]. However, the level of Mg2+-free ATP in the hexokinase PII
      assay mixture strongly affects the enzyme activity by decreasing the Vmax and
      increasing the Km value for Mg-ATP from 0.15 mM to 5.0 mM. The physiological role
      of this inhibition, which has not been described previously, was investigated by 
      determining the cytosolic ATP and Mg2+ concentrations in yeast cells grown under 
      derepressing and repressing conditions. Derepression is accompanied by an
      important loss of Mg2+ from the cells, maintaining the ATP concentration
      constant. This produces an increase of Mg2+-free ATP in the cytosol from 0.01 mM 
      to 0.1 mM. This free ATP concentration would lead to a maximal inhibition of
      hexokinase PII.

TI  - Transcription of the phosphoglycerate kinase gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      increases when fermentative cultures are stressed by heat-shock.
PG  - 525-31
AB  - The single gene for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) in the haploid genome of
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae is expressed to a very high level in cultures fermenting
      glucose. Despite this it responds to heat-shock. When S. cerevisiae growing
      exponentially on glucose media was shifted from 25 degrees C to 38 degrees C
      transient increases of 6-7-fold in cellular PGK mRNA were observed. This
      elevation in PGK mRNA still occurred in the presence of the protein-synthesis
      inhibitor cycloheximide, but was not observed in cells bearing the rna1.1
      mutation. From the kinetics of continuous labelling of PGK mRNA, relative to the 
      labelling of other RNAs in the same cultures whose levels do not alter with
      heat-shock, it was shown that the elevation in PGK mRNA in response to
      temperature upshift reflects primarily an increased synthesis of this mRNA and
      not an alteration of its half-life. PGK mRNA synthesis is therefore one target of
      a response mechanism to thermal stress. Synthesis of PGK enzyme in glucose-grown 
      cultures is efficient after mild (25 degrees C to 38 degrees C) or severe (25
      degrees C to 42 degrees C) heat-shocks. Following the severe shock, the synthesis
      of most proteins is abruptly terminated, but synthesis of PGK and a few other
      glycolytic enzymes continues at levels comparable to the levels of synthesis of
      most of those proteins dramatically induced by heat (heat-shock proteins). Cells 
      that overproduce PGK due to the presence of multiple copies of the PGK gene on a 
      high-copy-number plasmid continue their overproduction of this enzyme during
      severe thermal stress. Therefore PGK mRNA is both elevated in level in response
      to heat-shock and translated efficiently at supra-optimal temperatures.

TI  - Immunocytochemical localization of cytochrome P-450 in hepatic and extra-hepatic 
      tissues of the rat with a monoclonal antibody against cytochrome P-450 c.
PG  - 4543-54
AB  - The cellular distribution of cytochrome P-450 has been studied in the liver and a
      number of extrahepatic tissues in the rat by immunocytochemistry, using an
      antibody raised against cytochrome P-450 form c. Immunoreactive cytochrome P-450,
      most probably form c, was found in the proximal tubules of the kidney, in the
      Clara cells of the lung, and in the olfactory epithelium and Bowman's glands of
      the olfactory tissue, in addition to its location in the liver. Immunoreactive
      cytochrome P-450 was not found in the small intestine, the testes or the adrenal 
      gland, although these organs are known to contain isoenzymes of cytochrome P-450.
      The use of antibody titration enabled the effects of phenobarbitone,
      beta-naphthoflavone and clofibrate on the content and distribution of
      immunoreactive cytochrome P-450 to be studied in both the liver and in the other 
      organs discussed. Phenobarbitone induces epitope-specific cytochrome P-450 in the
      centrilobular cells of the liver but has no effect in any of the other tissues
      studied. Clofibrate is without effect on the levels of immunoreactive cytochrome 
      P-450 in any of the tissues studied. In contrast, beta-naphthoflavone induces
      immunoreactive cytochrome P-450 in the periportal region of the liver, and also
      in the Clara cells of the lung, in the enterocytes of the small intestine and in 
      the proximal tubules of the kidney. Of all of the tissues studied, in which
      immunoreactive cytochrome P-450 could be detected, only the olfactory epithelium 
      failed to undergo enzyme induction following treatment with beta-naphthoflavone.

TI  - Calcium antagonists stimulate prostaglandin synthesis by cultured rat cardiac
      myocytes and prevent the effects of hypoxia.
PG  - 4401-7
AB  - The effect of three calcium antagonists on the synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2,
      assayed as 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha) and PGE2 by cultured rat cardiac myocytes and
      fibroblasts was investigated. In myocytes only, bepridil, diltiazem and verapamil
      (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) stimulated PGs synthesis by two- to three-fold,
      dose-dependently. At a concentration of 10(-6) or 10(-5) M the intensity of the
      stimulation of PGI2 and PGE2 decreased. Cobalt chloride (2 X 10(-3) M) did not
      change PGs synthesis (pg/mg of protein/30 min; means +/- SE, N = 10; PGE2: 365
      +/- 59 and 463 +/- 89 treated vs controls; PGI2: 824 +/- 214 and 799 +/- 143
      treated vs controls). After 30 min exposure of myocytes to hypoxic conditions
      (glucose-free medium and low PO2), the glycogen content was half that of the
      controls (P less than 0.001), ATP content did not change and PGI2 and PGE2
      synthesis increased (X1.5, P less than 0.05). When applied to myocytes 30 min
      before inducing hypoxia, the three calcium antagonists stimulated PGs synthesis
      by three- to seven-fold at maximal effect, and bepridil (10(-8) M) or diltiazem
      (10(-7) M) prevented the hypoxia-induced decrease in glycogen content. With
      10(-5) M drug concentration, the effect on PGs was not significant, except for
      the effect of bepridil on PGI2 (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that
      therapeutic concentrations of calcium antagonists simultaneously prevent the
      decrease in myocyte glycogen induced by hypoxia and stimulate PGs synthesis by
      myocytes.

TI  - Pigment dispersion syndrome in pseudophakic corneal transplants.
PG  - 762-5
AB  - We observed the pigment dispersion syndrome in two patients after keratoplasty
      with posterior chamber intraocular lenses. In addition to a heavily pigmented
      trabecular mesh-work and iris transilluminating defects, an inferior linear
      pigmented endothelial line was seen in both patients. One patient developed
      glaucoma, which was well controlled with medication. Pigment dispersion syndrome 
      in patients with penetrating keratoplasty should not be confused with an
      allograft reaction but should alert the transplant surgeon that a different
      process is occurring.

AB  - We performed extracapsular lens extraction with implantation of a J-loop
      posterior chamber lens in 14 rabbit eyes. Postoperatively, the animals were
      examined by slit lamp. They were killed after varying survival times of up to 12 
      weeks, and the implants were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Three days
      after the operation a thin amorphous coating that did not consist of collagen was
      found covering all implants. Three cell types were present on the coating:
      macrophages, leukocytes, and flattened giant cells. This coating resembled
      morphologically the fibronectin coating on intraocular lenses in vitro.

      with intraocular lens implantation.
PG  - 723-6
AB  - We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial on the use of 2%
      hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 1% sodium hyaluronate in the anterior chamber
      during anterior capsulotomy and nuclear expression in extracapsular cataract
      extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation in 70 patients. Both
      viscoelastic substances helped maintain the anterior chamber and facilitated the 
      operation, although sodium hyaluronate was preferred. There was no excessive
      intraocular inflammation or toxicity noted with either agent. Patients given
      sodium hyaluronate had a larger increase in intraocular pressure during the early
      postoperative period (2.04 mm Hg) than did those given hydroxypropyl
      methylcellulose (1.1 mm Hg), but the difference was not significant. Nine weeks
      after surgery, the mean (+/- SD) central endothelial cell loss was 4.84% (+/-
      7.26%) in the 17 eyes with sodium hyaluronate and 4.37% (+/- 9.84%) in the 53
      eyes with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. The intraocular pressure and corneal
      thickness were not significantly different before operation and nine weeks after 
      it.

TI  - Ganglioside expression in macrophages from endotoxin responder and nonresponder
      mice.
PG  - 3921-7
AB  - Peritoneal macrophage ganglioside patterns and ganglioside sialic acid content
      were compared for two congenic strains of mice having differing responses to
      bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Resident macrophage ganglioside patterns from
      C3H/HeJ mice (endotoxin hyporesponsive) and C3H/HeN mice (endotoxin responsive)
      were similar. Macrophages elicited with phenol-extracted or butanol-extracted
      endotoxin showed distinctly more complex ganglioside patterns in C3H/HeN mice.
      C3H/HeJ macrophages showed distinct, but less complex changes when elicited with 
      butanol-extracted endotoxin. As expected, there were minimal alterations induced 
      by phenol-extracted endotoxin in the C3H/HeJ patterns. When injected with whole
      killed E. coli, both strains of mice exhibited complex ganglioside patterns;
      however, there were relative differences in the quantities of multiple
      gangliosides. Differences in ganglioside patterns were mirrored in the relative
      ratios of N-acetyl- to N-glycolylneuraminic acid. When macrophages were activated
      by administration of either endotoxin preparation, macrophage gangliosides from
      C3H/HeN mice always contained a higher proportion of N-acetylneuraminic acid
      compared with C3H/HeJ macrophage gangliosides. Oxidative metabolism of the
      macrophage populations was assessed by PMA-induced H2O2 release. This indicated
      that endotoxin activation produced an increase in PMA-induced H2O2 release as
      well as a shift of sialic acid class from the N-glycolyl type to the N-acetyl
      type. However, no direct correlation could be made between ganglioside
      composition, sialic acid content, and macrophage function. These data indicate
      that both ganglioside composition and sialic acid composition of macrophages are 
      profoundly altered with endotoxin activation. The data further indicate that
      under conditions which C3H/HeJ mice respond to Gram-negative bacteria, their
      macrophage ganglioside patterns still differ from normal mice.

TI  - Major histocompatibility complex-encoded class I molecules are absent in
      immunologically competent Xenopus before metamorphosis.
PG  - 3891-9
AB  - The expression of class I and class II major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC)-encoded antigens has been examined at various stages of the development of 
      the clawed frog, Xenopus. By immunoprecipitation with alloantisera or
      xenoantisera from radio-labeled spleen and thymus lysates, and by mixed
      lymphocyte reaction analysis, it was determined that the same class II molecules 
      are expressed throughout ontogeny. In contrast, by fluorescence on frozen
      sections of tadpoles and by immunoprecipitation, the class I molecule is not
      detected in tadpoles, but appears on all tissues at the climax of metamorphosis. 
      Animals maintained as tadpoles for long periods of time by chemical treatment do 
      express class I antigens; thus, their expression can be independent of other
      biochemical and morphological changes that occur at metamorphosis.
      Immunofluorescence detects an otherwise uncharacterized MHC-linked alloantigen on
      tadpole thymic epithelium from the earliest stages of thymus differentiation.

      (PM-Scl) associated with polymyositis/scleroderma overlap syndromes.
PG  - 3802-8
AB  - Precipitating anti-PM-Scl antibodies are present in sera from patients with
      polymyositis, scleroderma, and polymyositis/scleroderma overlap syndromes. By
      indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-PM-Scl antibodies stained the
      nucleolus in cells of different tissues and species, suggesting that the antigen 
      is highly conserved. By electron microscopy, anti-PM-Scl antibodies reacted
      primarily with the granular component of the nucleolus. Drugs that inhibit rRNA
      synthesis had a marked effect on the expression of PM-Scl antigen. In actinomycin
      D-treated cells, immunofluorescence staining by anti-PM-Scl was significantly
      reduced with residual staining restricted to the granular regions of nucleoli.
      Treatment with 5,6-dichloro-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) also
      selectively reduced nucleolar staining. On a molecular level, anti-PM-Scl
      antibodies precipitated 11 polypeptides with molecular weights (Mr) ranging from 
      110,000 to 20,000. The Mr 80,000 and 20,000 polypeptides were phosphorylated.
      Evidence suggests that the PM-Scl antigen complex may be related to a
      preribosomal particle.

      response after antigen presentation, the purpose of this study was to determine
      the presence of ICA and antibodies against the 64,000 islet antigen after
      separation of IgM from IgG to prevent interference between the two antibody
      classes. Plasma samples from 10 newly diagnosed IDDM children and 10 healthy
      controls were precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the crude Ig was
      subjected to Sephacryl S-300 chromatography to separate IgM and IgG. ICA
      determined by indirect immunofluorescence on frozen sections of human pancreas
      showed reduced background immunofluorescence intensity in the purified fractions 
      compared with crude plasma. The number of ICA-positive samples among the IDDM
      patients increased from 7/10 in plasma to 9/10 in the IgG fraction. There was an 
      increase in the ICA titer in 6/9 of the positive samples. All purified IgM
      samples were ICA negative. Immunoprecipitation experiments by using Nonidet P-40 
      detergent lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled neonatal rat islets demonstrated
      that the 64,000 autoantibodies were in the IgG fraction. We found 7/10 IDDM
      samples to be positive, whereas all controls were negative. The background in the
      autoradiographic analysis was markedly reduced in the IgG fractions compared with
      immunoprecipitates with crude or PEG-purified plasma and the IgM fraction. ICA
      titers did not correlate to the ability of the IgG fraction to precipitate the
      64,000 autoantigen. It is concluded that both the ICA and 64,000 autoantibodies
      are primarily of the IgG class at the time of clinical onset of IDDM, and that
      purification of IgG from human IDDM plasma facilitates the detection of the rat
      islet cell 64,000 antigen.

TI  - A human autoreactive T cell line specific for minor histocompatibility antigen(s)
      isolated from a bone marrow-grafted patient.
PG  - 3772-6
AB  - A human autoreactive T cell line named Bur-1 has been obtained from a woman 4 mo 
      after an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from one of her
      HLA-identical brothers. The phenotype of the cell line is 100% T11+ and over 90% 
      T4+, and the karyotype confirms its donor (male) origin. These donor T cells
      proliferate specifically in the presence of donor's peripheral blood monocytes
      (PBM) but not recipient's cells, and they kill specifically donor's but not
      recipient's Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). PBM
      from another HLA-identical brother and from several unrelated donors also
      stimulate Bur-1 cells, and EBV-induced LCL from the same donors are killed in
      cytotoxicity assays. All of these donors share HLA-DR5 or HLA-DRw11 (the major
      split of HLA-DR5) with Bur-1 cells. However, some but not all of the PBM sharing 
      HLA-DR5 with Bur-1 cells are recognized. Therefore, in contrast with the
      previously described autoreactive T cells, Bur-1 cells are not directed against
      self-MHC antigens but rather recognize autologous minor histocompatibility (mH)
      antigens in the context of autologous HLA class II molecules. Because both male
      and female cells can be recognized, the reacting minor antigen could not be the
      male-specific HY antigen. It is suggested that autoreactivity against mH antigens
      can be observed in bone marrow-grafted patients due to the education of bone
      marrow donor precursors in the recipient thymus not allowing tolerance to
      autologous (donor) mH antigens not shared by the recipient.

TI  - The glucose transporter in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is phosphorylated in response to
      phorbol ester but not in response to insulin.
PG  - 16597-603
AB  - At maximally active concentrations with 20-min exposure, insulin and phorbol
      myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated hexose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by 11-
      and 2-fold, respectively. The potential role of phosphorylation of the glucose
      transporter (GT) in these stimulations was investigated by the isolation of GT
      through immunoprecipitation from ortho[32P]phosphate-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
      It was found that there was no significant 32P incorporation into GT from basal
      adipocytes after 2- or 18 h-labeling in the presence of 0.5 mCi of 32Pi/ml.
      Furthermore, under these labeling conditions, insulin treatment for 1, 4, or 30
      min failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of GT. Also, there was no detectable 
      phosphate incorporation into GT upon reversal of insulin-stimulated hexose
      transport by the removal of insulin (half-time for reversal approximately 8 min).
      In contrast to these results, exposure of adipocytes to PMA (1 microM) for 20 min
      elicited a phosphorylation of GT to the extent of about 0.1 phosphate/GT
      molecule. Exposure of cells to both insulin and PMA resulted in a 3-fold increase
      in the level of phosphate in GT compared to that seen with PMA alone. Possibly
      this increase is due to the translocation of GT to the plasma membrane where it
      is a better substrate for activated protein kinase C. Stimulation of hexose
      transport was the same with the combined treatment of insulin and PMA compared to
      that seen with insulin alone. These results indicate that neither a change in the
      phosphorylation state of the GT nor activation of protein kinase C is involved in
      the mechanism by which the insulin receptor stimulates glucose transport.

TI  - A serine protease triggers the initial step of transmembrane signalling in
      cytotoxic T cells.
PG  - 16514-7
AB  - We report here by using stopped-flow fluorometry with three different fluorescent
      probes that a serine protease triggers the initial step of transmembrane
      signalling in cytotoxic T cells. When cytotoxic T cells (mouse LC7, H-2b anti
      H-2d) bound to the specific target cells (mouse mastocytoma P815, H-2d),
      cytotoxic T cells first increased their membrane fluidity, and calcium then was
      released from intracellular stores. After that, there was a calcium influx from
      the external medium into the T cells. All of these steps, however, were blocked
      by serine protease inhibitors (soybean trypsin inhibitor, N
      alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl
      ketone). Bovine pancreatic trypsin and chymotrypsin in the external medium
      mimicked the signalling events which were triggered by the serine protease on the
      T cell surfaces. From the reaction time (within 1 s) and its specificity, this
      serine protease in cytotoxic T cells was considered to be different from a
      protease which works at the killing stage.

TI  - Interaction between L-threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthetase and
      mechanism of aminoacetone production.
PG  - 16428-37
AB  - A mixture of threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthetase will catalyze
      the conversion of L-threonine to glycine. The overall reaction likely involves
      the conversion of L-threonine, NAD+, and CoA to glycine, NADH, and acetyl-CoA.
      Physical separation of L-threonine dehydrogenase from aminoacetone synthetase
      results in the formation of aminoacetone and CO2 from their substrates. A
      physical interaction between threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthetase 
      has been demonstrated by gel permeation chromatography and fluorescence
      polarization. Polarization of fluorescence measurements of threonine
      dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthetase labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate
      indicated the formation of a soluble active complex, with an apparent
      dissociation constant (Kd) of 5-10 nM and an apparent stoichiometry of 2
      aminoacetone synthetase dimers/1 threonine dehydrogenase tetramer. Chemical
      experiments have identified aminoacetone as the enzymatic product of L-threonine 
      dehydrogenase acting on L-threonine. These experiments involved trapping pyrrole 
      derivatives, [3H]NaBH4 reduction, and coupling with plasma amine oxidase. Kinetic
      experiments also showed NADH, CO2, and aminoacetone to inhibit threonine
      dehydrogenase in a manner consistent with an ordered Bi-Ter kinetic mechanism.
      NAD+ is the lead substrate followed by threonine, and the products are released
      in the order: CO2, aminoacetone, and NADH.

TI  - In vitro synthesis of alpha-carboxyl-linked folylpolyglutamates by an enzyme
      preparation from Escherichia coli.
PG  - 16363-71
AB  - Extracts of Escherichia coli contained an enzymatic activity which catalyzed the 
      addition of L-glutamate to the alpha-carboxyl of various polyglutamate
      substrates, including folylpolyglutamates. Much of the enzyme activity was
      separated by DE52 chromatography and gel filtration from the enzyme which adds
      the first three glutamates in the biosynthesis of folylpolyglutamates,
      dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The two enzyme activities
      differed in many properties. Whereas dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate 
      synthetase preferred pteroate or pteroylmonoglutamate substrates, the
      folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase preparations effectively utilized
      tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates, pteroylpolyglutamates,
      p-aminobenzoylpolyglutamates (pAB(Glu)n), and even a polyglutamate tripeptide.
      Several di- and triglutamyl peptides were inhibitory to folylpoly-alpha-glutamate
      synthetase activity, but not to dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate
      synthetase. Conversely, dihydropteroate noncompetitively inhibits the
      folylpolyglutamate synthetase reaction of the dihydrofolate
      synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase protein, but did not inhibit the
      folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase reaction. Potassium chloride was inhibitory 
      to folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase activity (as were other salts and several
      polyanions), in contrast to the absolute requirement of dihydrofolate
      synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity for a monovalent cation such as
      K+. Incubation of a folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase preparation with
      (6S)-tetrahydropteroyltri(gamma)glutamate generated products which after chemical
      cleavage to pAB(Glu)n were identical to those from growing E. coli, in high
      performance liquid chromatography retention times and in pattern of digestion by 
      alpha-COOH bond-specific carboxypeptidase Y. High performance liquid
      chromatography and mass spectral analysis of the products of the in vitro
      reactions of folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase with several substrates also
      demonstrated the addition of glutamate residues via alpha-COOH linkages. Thus,
      there appear to be two folylpolyglutamate synthetase activities in E. coli,
      dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase which adds the first three
      glutamate residues by gamma-COOH linkages and the folylpoly-alpha-glutamate
      synthetase activity which extends the folylpolyglutamate chain via gamma-COOH
      peptide bonds.

PG  - 16356-62
AB  - Folate cofactors in most cells contain polyglutamate side chains, which since the
      late 1940s have been assumed to be linked via their gamma-COOH groups. We report 
      here an investigation of the structure of the polyglutamate chain attached to the
      folates of Escherichia coli. Folates were extracted from E. coli grown with
      [7-14C] p-aminobenzoate and cleaved to p-aminobenzoyl polyglutamates of varying
      chain lengths (pAB(Glu)n) by the method of Foo et al. (Foo, S. K., Cichowicz, D. 
      J., and Shane, B. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 107, 109-115). The pAB(Glu)n derived from
      E. coli did not co-chromatograph with chemically synthesized pAB(gamma-Glu)n-Glu 
      on several high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, except for the 
      triglutamate which did elute with pAB(gamma-Glu)2-Glu. E. coli-derived
      pAB(Glu)3-8 were purified by HPLC on C18 columns eluted with
      acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, and the structures were determined through
      mass spectrometry, chiral amino acid analysis, and peptidase digestion
      experiments. Molecular weight determinations on the methyl ester derivatives of
      E. coli-derived pAB(Glu)n by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry and sequence 
      analysis using collision-activated dissociation on a tandem mass spectrometer
      confirmed the structures as pAB(Glu)3-8. Chiral HPLC of hydrolyzed and dansylated
      E. coli-derived materials, on a beta-cyclodextrin column, identified the
      glutamate as the L-enantiomer. pAB(Glu)n were digested with carboxypeptidase Y,
      which specifically cleaved glutamates linked at their alpha-carboxyls; E.
      coli-derived pAB(Glu)4-8 (but not synthetic pAB(gamma-Glu1-6-Glu) were
      sequentially digested to pAB(gamma-Glu)2-Glu. Thus, in E. coli
      folylpolyglutamates, glutamate residues 4-8 were each linked to the polyglutamate
      chain at the alpha-carboxyl of the preceding glutamate.

      involving the left ilium and bone marrow. He received radiation therapy to the
      left hip for stabilization, then eight cycles of intense (COP-BLAM) chemotherapy.
      Restaging at the completion of therapy demonstrated a normal physical
      examination, laboratory values, bone scan, bone survey, and abdominal
      computerized tomographic scan. One month after restaging he developed rapidly
      enlarging lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of an axillary node showed complete fatty
      replacement without lymphoma, and the patient remains in remission 16 months
      later. Recent reports of residual masses after lymphoma therapy have demonstrated
      fibrous replacement, necrotic tissue, thymic hyperplasia, and vascular anomalies 
      mimicking lymphadenopathy. Lymph node enlargement may be due to nonmalignant
      causes, including fatty replacement, and not due to recurrent lymphoma.

TI  - Prognostic significance of tumor grade in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy for
      breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastasis.
PG  - 2662-70
AB  - The prognostic significance of histologic tumor grade has been evaluated in 1537 
      women entered into the Ludwig Trials I-IV of adjuvant therapy for node-positive
      breast cancer. Tumor grade was determined on histologic review of primary tumor
      sections by two central review pathologists using a modification of the Bloom and
      Richardson grading system. The 5-year overall survival rates (+/- SE) were: Grade
      1, 86% +/- 2; Grade 2, 70% +/- 2; and Grade 3, 57% +/- 2 (P less than 0.0001).
      This survival difference was seen in both premenopausal (P less than 0.0001) and 
      postmenopausal (P less than 0.0001) women. Significant differences in
      disease-free survival (DFS) by tumor grade were also observed (P less than
      0.0001). The tumor grade determined by the 75 contributing local clinic
      pathologists was also highly significant for predicting DFS and overall survival.
      Tumor grade remained a statistically significant prognostic factor for DFS (P
      less than 0.0001) and overall survival (P less than 0.0001) in multivariate
      analyses controlling for nodal status, tumor size, estrogen receptor status,
      menopausal status, age, peritumoral vessel invasion, and treatment assigned. In
      postmenopausal patients for whom adjuvant treatment was compared with no adjuvant
      therapy, the prognostic significance of tumor grade was modified by the effect of
      treatment. The presence of vessel invasion by primary tumor cells was a stronger 
      predictor of early recurrence than was increasing tumor grade in postmenopausal
      patients who received no adjuvant therapy. The higher failure rates for patients 
      with high-grade tumors was due to a larger number of failures in regional and
      visceral sites. Tumor grade can be determined by any pathologist and allows for
      selection of a subpopulation of breast cancer patients at high risk for early
      mortality.

TI  - Light stimulates the rapid formation of inositol trisphosphate in squid retinas.
PG  - 929-32
AB  - To test the hypothesis that inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) mediates adaptation
      and excitation in invertebrate photoreceptors, we measured its formation on a
      rapid time scale in squid retinas. For squid, excitation and adaption occurs
      within 0.1 and 1-2 s respectively. We could detect an elevation in InsP3 within
      200 ms of a bright flash. This increase is about 240% over dark basal levels and 
      is maintained for at least 2 min after a flash. The increase probably occurs in
      the photoreceptors, which are the only neurons in squid retinas. Analysis by
      h.p.l.c. indicates that the light-regulated isomer is Ins(1,4,5)P3, which is
      formed by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP2).

TI  - Effects of weakly basic amines on proteolytic processing and terminal
      glycosylation of secretory proteins in cultured rat hepatocytes.
PG  - 739-45
AB  - We examined the effects of weakly basic amines on the secretion and
      post-translational modifications of secretory proteins in cultured rat
      hepatocytes. Weakly basic amines such as methylamine, chloroquine and NH4Cl
      strongly inhibited not only protein secretion, but also the proteolytic
      conversion of a proform of complement C3, allowing the precursor to be released
      into the medium. The amines, however, had no effect on the proteolytic conversion
      of prohaptoglobin into its subunits. Since available evidence indicates that the 
      conversion of pro-C3 occurs at the Golgi complex while that of prohaptoglobin
      takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, it is most likely that the weak bases
      specifically affect the proteolytic event occurring at the Golgi complex.
      Electron microscopic observations confirmed that the amines caused morphological 
      changes of the Golgi complex, consisting of dilated cisternae and swollen
      vacuoles. When the glycosylation of alpha 1-protease inhibitor and haptoglobin
      was examined, it was found that the amines caused a marked accumulation in the
      cells of both glycoproteins corresponding to the mature secreted forms.
      Neuraminidase digestion demonstrated that the glycoproteins accumulating in
      response to the amines had acquired terminal sialic acid. The results indicate
      that the amines do not significantly affect terminal glycosylation, in contrast
      with their definite effect on proteolytic processing, despite the fact that both 
      modifications take place in the Golgi complex.

TI  - [Malignant melanoma: increase in incidence and mortality in West Germany].
PG  - 1751-64
AB  - Based on official statistics of causes of deaths and data from regional cancer
      registers as well as clinical epidemiological data from our clinic, incidence and
      mortality of malignant melanoma of the skin (MM) in Germany has been analysed.
      Between 1970 and 1980, the mortality rate of MM according to age rose by 20% for 
      both men and women; the regional incidence in the Saarland, for example,
      increased by more than 50% (men: 3.4 to 4.6; women: 3.2 to 6.0 per 100,000
      inhabitants a year). The earlier development of the MM mortality can be estimated
      by analysing the mortality of skin cancers in general. In the age groups between 
      30 and 69 years, the skin cancer mortality was nearly exclusively caused by MM;
      the mortality rates according to age increased between 1955 and 1980 by more than
      100% for men and by more than 75% for women. According to all available data, the
      MM incidence in West Germany in 1980 was estimated to be 5 per 100,000
      inhabitants for men and 8 per 100,000 inhabitants for women. Assuming a
      continuous increase of incidences, we expect 5,500 new MM cases in 1985.

TI  - Ciamexone, a highly selective immunomodulator--a tool for autoimmune diseases?
PG  - 1261-6
AB  - Both organ-specific diseases such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well 
      as non organ-specific disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis are thought to be
      autoimmune in origin. Both T-cell and B-cell mediated immune responses are
      involved in these diseases. More or less specific immunosuppressants are
      therefore widely used drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases which,
      however, suppress the immune reactions not only against autoantigens but also
      against foreign antigens. Cyclosporine (Cyclosporin A) has been a tremendous step
      forward in a more specific direction but it creates problems in the long term
      treatment of autoimmune diseases due to the impairment of immune reactions
      against foreign antigens as well as to compound specific side effects. Ciamexone,
      a new highly selective immunomodulator, might be an interesting new approach in
      the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The compound has had effect in different
      experimental autoimmune situations such as the diabetic BB-rat and
      experimentally-induced arthritis in mice or rats. The compound does not show
      antiproliferative activity on T-lymphocytes or B-lymphocytes. The immune response
      against foreign antigens, e.g. foreign major histocompatibility complex, viral or
      fungal antigens is not impaired. On the other hand, however, Ciamexone suppresses
      the antibody production in different animal systems. It is likely that Ciamexone 
      exhibits its immunosuppressive property via the induction of regulating
      mechanisms. Due to its remarkably good tolerance, Ciamexone has been used in
      first pilot trials in different human autoimmune situations such as rheumatoid
      arthritis and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Time-resolved X-ray diffraction studies of frog skeletal muscle isometrically
      twitched by two successive stimuli using synchrotron radiation.
PG  - 161-8
AB  - In order to clarify the delay between muscular structural changes and mechanical 
      responses, the intensity changes of the equatorial and myosin layer-line
      reflections were studied by a time-resolved X-ray diffraction technique using
      synchrotron radiation. The muscle was stimulated at 12-13 degrees C by two
      successive stimuli at an interval (80-100 ms) during which the second twitch
      started while tension was still being exerted by the muscle. At the first twitch,
      the intensity changes of the 1.0 and 1.1 equatorial reflections reached 65 and
      200% of the resting values, and further changes to 55 and 220% were seen at the
      second twitch, respectively. Although the second twitch decreased not only the
      time to peak tension but also that to the maximum intensity changes of the
      equatorial reflections (in both cases, about 15 ms), the delay (about 20 ms)
      between the intensity changes and the development of tension at the first twitch 
      were still observed at the second twitch. On the other hand, the intensities of
      the 42.9 nm off-meridional and the 21.5 nm meridional myosin reflections
      decreased at the first twitch to the levels found when a muscle was isometrically
      tetanized, and no further decrease in their intensities was observed at the
      second twitch. These results indicate that a certain period of time is necessary 
      for myosin heads to contribute to tension development after their arrival in the 
      vicinity of the thin filaments during contraction.

TI  - Serum type III procollagen peptide as a non-invasive marker of liver damage
      during infancy and childhood in extrahepatic biliary atresia, idiopathic
      hepatitis of infancy and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency.
PG  - 137-46
AB  - To evaluate the role of serum procollagen III peptide as a non-invasive marker of
      liver damage and prognosis in hepatobiliary disorders of infancy, we have
      measured its concentration at presentation and serially in 30 infants with
      extrahepatic biliary atresia, 22 with idiopathic hepatitis of infancy, 10 with
      alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and 105 age-matched controls. Raised procollagen
      III peptide concentrations occurred in 51% of patients at presentation and 59% at
      follow up but were not related to the type of liver disease or the severity of
      liver damage, as assessed either by standard biochemical tests of liver function,
      serum glycocholic acid, semiquantitative assessment of 11 histopathological
      features or hepatic prolyl hydroxylase activity. Serum procollagen III peptide
      concentrations also gave no guide to prognosis. Although the factors determining 
      serum procollagen III peptide concentrations in hepatobiliary disorders of
      infancy are unknown at the present time, we suggest that changes in growth rate
      may be of major importance in determining the significance of serum procollagen
      III peptide concentrations in infants and children.

TI  - Stabilization and partial characterization of endothelium-derived relaxing factor
      from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells.
PG  - 689-96
AB  - The extreme lability of the chemically undefined vasoregulatory mediator,
      endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), has been overcome. The activity of
      EDRF, from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells stimulated with A23187, was
      stabilized by acidification. An additional action of EDRF, platelet
      disaggregation was used as a sensitive and convenient bioassay to monitor
      purification. EDRF appears to be a hydrophilic molecule, rapidly inactivated
      under alkaline conditions. However, activity is restored upon reacidification
      suggesting that this instability results from a readily reversible chemical
      process. The stabilization and partial purification of EDRF sets the stage for
      its further biochemical and chemical characterization.

      moiety in the penultimate position of the oligonucleotide substrate.
PG  - 555-61
AB  - 3'-Deoxyadenosine (3'dA, cordycepin)-substituted analogs of 2-5A core
      5'-monophosphate (p5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A) were examined for their sensitivity toward
      degradation by the 2'-phosphodiesterase activity in cytoplasmic extracts of mouse
      L cells. The analogs, p5'(3'dA)-2'p5'A2'p5'A, p5'(3'dA)2'p5'A2'p5'(3'dA) and
      p5'A2'p5'A2'p5'(3'dA) were degraded at a rate comparable to p5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A
      itself. On the other hand, under the assay conditions examined
      p5'A2'p5'(3'dA)2'p5'A, like p5'(3'dA)2'p5'(3'dA)2'p5'(3'dA), was completely
      resistant to degradation. The data imply that sensitivity to the
      2',5'-phosphodiesterase activity of mouse L cells requires the presence of
      3'-hydroxyl moiety in the penultimate nucleotide.

TI  - A paradoxical effect of antibody concentration on vWF-dependent platelet
      agglutination distinguishes between botrocetin and ristocetin-induced
      agglutination.
PG  - 749-60
AB  - Several heterologous antisera directed against either human or porcine von
      Willebrand factor (vWF), inhibited botrocetin-induced vWF-dependent agglutination
      at high concentrations but were found to enhance this reaction at low
      concentrations. Purified IgG from these immune sera also potentiated
      botrocetin-induced agglutination as did its F(ab)'2 fragments. However,
      monovalent Fab fragments of the purified IgG did not. The requirement for a
      divalent antigen combining region suggests that one possible mechanism of
      enhanced agglutination may involve intra or inter-molecular cross-linking of vWF 
      multimers by the antibody. Another possible mechanism could be a conformational
      change in the vWF molecule induced by antibody binding. Such a conformational
      change may provide additional active sites on the vWF molecule that, in the
      presence of botrocetin, lead to enhancement of the agglutination reaction.
      Antisera to human vWF that showed this paradoxical inhibitory/enhancing effect on
      botrocetin-induced agglutination also inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet
      agglutination at high concentrations, but failed to enhance agglutination at any 
      concentration. The different effects of these antisera on botrocetin and
      ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination suggest that no single mechanism can
      explain the action of both of these mediators.

TI  - Distribution of vestibular afferents that innervate the sacculus and posterior
      canal in the gerbil.
PG  - 410-24
AB  - The central distribution of afferents that innervate the macula of the saccule
      and the crista of the posterior canal was assessed in the gerbil following the
      direct injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) separately into the sensory
      neuroepithelia of each peripheral receptor organ. Ganglion cells innervating the 
      posterior canal were located in the caudal part of the inferior ganglion, while
      those cells innervating the saccule were located in the rostral part of the
      inferior ganglion, scattered in the superior ganglion, and concentrated at the
      junction (isthmus) between the two. The paths of the central axons of these two
      groups of ganglion cells through the vestibular root and their division into
      ascending or descending pathways were similar. However, the distributions of
      their terminals were different. The posterior canal projected to medial parts of 
      the vestibular nuclear complex. Terminals were found in the medial and superior
      vestibular nuclei. The posterior canal also projected to the uvula of the
      cerebellum. The saccule projected to more lateral-lying brainstem areas. Terminal
      fields were located in the lateral and descending vestibular nuclei and cell
      group y. Saccule projections outside the vestibular complex were observed to the 
      lateral cuneate nucleus, the N. gigantocellularis, and the cerebellar cortex. Of 
      the eight areas receiving primary afferent projections from these two organs,
      only within the medial and descending vestibular nuclei and the cerebellar cortex
      were overlapping projections observed.

TI  - Establishment of a murine leukemia L1210-specific T-cell clone displaying novel
      in vivo anti-tumor activity.
PG  - 907-14
AB  - The murine leukemia L1210-specific cytotoxic T-cell clone K7 was established by
      repeated antigenic stimulation of spleen cells of L1210-immune CD2F1 mice in
      long-term culture. K7 possessed L1210-specific cytolytic activity detectable by
      the 51Cr-release test, but lost its cytolytic activity about 100 days after
      initiation of culture (designated as clone K7L). Clone K7L retained its
      L1210-specific tumor-growth-inhibitory activity independently of culture
      supplementation with IL-2. K7L possessed the cell-surface antigenic phenotype of 
      cytotoxic T cells, Thy-1+, Lyt-1-, Lyt-2+. This clone K7L displayed surprisingly 
      strong activity in specifically inhibiting in vivo tumor growth of L1210 by day 5
      in the peritoneal cavity of CD2F1 mice when injected together with 10(5) tumor
      cells (more than 90% inhibition at E/T = 5), and prolonged survival times of most
      of the mice for more than 60 days, whereas control mice inoculated with L1210
      alone died on day 9-17. This unique in vivo anti-tumor activity was not
      correlated to the in vitro cytolytic activity. Nevertheless, bystander inhibitory
      effect on the growth of third-party tumor cells (P388) was not seen in mice
      injected with a mixture of L1210 and P388 together with K7L, suggesting that K7L 
      inhibited L1210 growth by direct cell-to-cell interaction. Host cells such as
      X-irradiation (800R)-sensitive lymphocytes and Carrageenan-sensitive macrophages 
      were not involved in the early growth inhibition of L1210 by K7L.

AB  - We studied six cases of chronic, indolent intraocular inflammation that occurred

      cases had the clinical appearance of a granulomatous iridocyclitis. Cultures of
      intraocular specimens obtained from six eyes yielded Propionibacterium; five
      yielded P. acnes. Pleomorphic gram-positive bacilli consistent with
      Propionibacterium were identified in cytologic or histopathologic studies in four
      of the six culture-positive cases. After surgical and medical therapy, the
      inflammation resolved. Postoperative Propionibacterium endophthalmitis may
      masquerade as a chronic iridocyclitis.

TI  - Differential lack of class I H-2d antigen expression by sublines of the BALB/c
      S49 T cell lymphoma.
PG  - 4016-20
AB  - Five different sublines of the BALB/c murine S49.1 T cell lymphoma were found to 
      exhibit distinct patterns of absence of detectable H-2d class I major
      histocompatibility antigen expression. The results were demonstrated and verified
      by a) the generation of H-2Kd-, H-2Dd,Ld-, and H-2Ld-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes that were assayed on S49.1 target cell lines, b) antibody-mediated
      cytotoxicity with the use of anti-H-2d monoclonal reagents, and c) flow
      microfluorometry. The five lines investigated were S49.1, T-25, T-25ADH, Thy-1-, 
      and 100/0. None of these lines expressed detectable levels of Ld. S49.1 expressed
      both Kd and Dd, T-25 and T-25ADH expressed Dd but not Kd or Ld, Thy-1- expressed 
      Kd but not Dd or Ld, and 100.0 did not express any detectable amounts of Kd, Dd, 
      or Ld. These results indicate that K and D (and L) antigens can be expressed
      independently of each other and suggest that expression of class I antigens is
      controlled in a locus-specific manner.

TI  - Activation of T cell antigen receptor alpha- and beta-chain genes in the thymus: 
      implications for the lineages of developing cortical thymocytes.
PG  - 4010-5
AB  - Mammalian T lymphocytes mature in the thymus through a series of differentiation 
      events that involve both rapid proliferation and extensive cell death. The
      mechanisms that govern these processes are currently unknown; however, both
      mitogenesis and death affect particular subpopulations of cells, suggesting the
      selective amplification and destruction of specific T cell clones. In mature
      peripheral T cells, proliferation is most commonly triggered by the recognition
      of antigen through the T cell antigen receptor complex. If antigen recognition
      also controls proliferation in the thymus, the differential expression of antigen
      receptor genes during maturation could play some role in determining the fate of 
      developing T cells. In this study, we examined the expression of the alpha- and
      beta-chain genes of the T cell antigen receptor in different subpopulations of
      adult thymocytes. We compared two postmitotic populations--one that appears
      committed to die and one that appears mature--and several blast cell populations 
      that are enriched for precursors of one or another presumptive lineage. We have
      found that Lyt-2-, L3T4- precursor thymocytes express much lower levels of both
      alpha- and beta-chain mRNA than the cells likely to be their immediate
      descendents. Furthermore, our results show that the cells of the major cortical
      lineage, which have at least a 95% probability of death, nevertheless express
      high levels of mature mRNA encoding both the alpha- and the beta-chains of the T 
      cell antigen receptor. These results have important implications for the
      mechanisms involved in the overproduction and elimination of this major class of 
      T lymphocyte.

TI  - The immune response to Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced tumors: induction of
      cytolytic T lymphocytes specific for both viral and tumor-associated antigens.
PG  - 3968-72
AB  - The specificity of CTL generated against tumors induced by murine leukemia
      viruses (MuLV) has been reported to parallel the expression of two serologically 
      defined tumor cell surface antigens--the cross-reactive FMR antigen expressed on 
      the surface of tumors induced by Friend, Moloney, and Rauscher MuLV, and the
      Gross cell surface antigen (GCSA) expressed on tumors induced by AKV/Gross MuLV. 
      We examined the specificity of CTL generated against MuLV-induced tumors and
      identified two distinct patterns of reactivity. The first follows the traditional
      pattern of FMR vs GCSA reactivity as assessed on a panel of established
      MuLV-induced lymphomas. However, CTL exhibiting this pattern of reactivity are
      incapable of lysing MuLV-infected fibroblasts. CTL exhibiting the second pattern 
      of reactivity are capable of lysing MuLV-induced lymphomas as well as
      MuLV-infected fibroblasts. In addition, these CTL exhibit extensive
      cross-reactivity between lymphomas and fibroblasts infected by both groups of
      MuLV. Our results suggest that CTL exhibiting the traditional FMR vs GCSA pattern
      of reactivity are directed against a tumor-associated antigen and not against
      virus-encoded antigens, and that CTL directed against MuLV-encoded antigens
      demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity, including the ability to lyse
      AKV-infected cells.

TI  - Induction of proliferation in vitro of resting human natural killer cells: IL 2
      induces into cell cycle most peripheral blood NK cells, but only a minor subset
      of low density T cells.
PG  - 3845-54
AB  - We report that resting human peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells
      proliferate in response to recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2), and addition of
      irradiated lymphoblastoid B cells significantly increase their proliferative
      response. Interaction of IL 2 with the Tac IL 2 receptor expressed on activated
      NK cells is necessary to maintain continued growth of these cells. Experiments in
      which NK cell mitosis is prevented by colchicine show that the majority of
      peripheral blood NK cells are induced into the first cell cycle over a 6-day
      culture period in the presence of rIL 2. The addition of the irradiated
      lymphoblastoid B cell line, Daudi, to colchicine blocked cultures does not
      increase the proportion of cells entering cell cycle in response to rIL 2 alone. 
      In limiting dilution analysis, only 1/1700 B73.1+ cells grow clonally in response
      to rIL 2. The frequency of clonal growth of NK cells in response to irradiated
      Daudi cells alone is minimal, whereas the addition of irradiated Daudi cells to
      rIL 2 stimulated cultures resulted in a 10-fold increase in clonal frequency
      compared with the cultures in rIL 2 alone. Therefore, Daudi cells may act by
      maintaining continuous proliferation of the NK cells originally responsive to IL 
      2. Unlike NK cells, only a minimal proportion of peripheral blood T cells
      proliferate in response to IL 2. These IL 2 responsive T cells are characterized 
      by a lower bouyant density than the majority of peripheral blood T cells. These
      results indicate physiologic differences between peripheral blood resting NK and 
      T cells in their ability to be induced to cycle. IL 2 is a growth factor for both
      cell types, but although the presence of the growth factor is sufficient for
      quiescent NK cells to be induced into cycle, T cells require antigenic or other
      mitogenic stimuli to respond to IL 2. The small proportion of light density IL 2 
      responsive T cells might represent in vivo activated T cells.

TI  - DM-20, a proteolipid apoprotein, is an encephalitogen of acute and relapsing
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice.
PG  - 3832-5
AB  - Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) was successfully induced in BALB/c 
      mice with DM-20, a protein component of proteolipid apoprotein. DM-20 was
      separated by ion exchange column chromatography with CM-Trisacryl from
      proteolipid apoprotein obtained from bovine spinal cords. Its purity was
      ascertained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a dot immunobinding
      procedure, and amino acid analysis. Nine of 15 animals with a single injection of
      100 micrograms of DM-20 and five of seven animals with a booster injection
      developed hind leg paralysis or axial rotatory movement 16 to 27 days after
      sensitization (mean 21.3 days). Five of the 14 animals relapsed 2 to 6 wk after
      the first attack. Histological examination revealed inflammatory lesion, with
      significant demyelination in the central nervous system. Antibody levels to DM-20
      were not related to the clinical signs. Five of 11 BALB/c nude mice reconstituted
      with T cells developed similar clinical and pathologic signs. This DM-20-induced 
      EAE in mice may provide a valuable model because it is similar to multiple
      sclerosis and because it can be induced in inbred mice in which immune mechanisms
      can be easily studied.

TI  - Therapy of rat autoimmune disease by a monoclonal antibody specific for T
      lymphoblasts.
PG  - 3814-20
AB  - The central role of T lymphocytes in the initiation, regulation and propagation
      of autoimmune diseases defines them as most suitable targets for selective
      immunotherapy. The recent advance in culturing human and animal T cell lines
      allows us to select monoclonal antibodies specific for differentiation antigens
      expressed by activated T lymphocytes. We selected a monoclonal antibody cytotoxic
      for a subpopulation of activated rat T cells. In vivo, this antibody effectively 
      blocks immune responses to foreign antigens or autoantigen and prevents
      development of autoimmune diseases like experimental allergic encephalomyelitis
      and adjuvant arthritis. Even already established disease can be blocked by a
      single injection of antibody. Furthermore, this monoclonal antibody can be used
      to monitor the course of autoimmune disease progression from peripheral blood
      samples.

TI  - Regulation of B cell activation by prostaglandins: cell cycle-specific effects on
      activation by anti-immunoglobulin and 8-mercaptoguanosine.
PG  - 3753-7
AB  - The current studies were undertaken to explore the regulatory effects of
      macrophages and their soluble products on B cell activation in defined medium by 
      surface membrane-directed mitogens (anti-Ig, LPS) and by intracellular mitogens
      (8-mercaptoguanosine, [8MGuo]). Supplementation of macrophage-depleted B cell
      cultures with adherent cells enhanced the response to anti-Ig but depressed the
      response to 8MGuo. These changes could be eliminated by adding indomethacin to B 
      cell cultures containing supplemental macrophages. Moreover, they could be
      reproduced by adding exogenous prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2) but not other
      macrophage products to cultured B cells. Prostaglandins regulate B cell function 
      (i.e., immunoglobulin secretion) in the same manner as they do mitogenesis. Thus,
      the polyclonal response to LPS is enhanced, whereas that to 8MGuo is inhibited.
      We showed previously that anti-Ig acts on a B cell subpopulation distinct from
      that stimulated by 8MGuo. Moreover, when addition of prostaglandin is delayed for
      more than 24 hr, the effect on the anti-Ig response changes from enhancement to
      inhibition and the effect on 8MGuo is lost, suggesting that in the course of
      activation the cell progresses through a series of cell cycle-specific regulatory
      states. Additionally, the mitogenic effects of 8MGuo appear to involve larger,
      cycling cells more than smaller cells. In concert, these data suggest a model for
      regulation of the B cell cycle in which prostaglandins, whose secretion is
      elicited by many surface-directed B cell stimuli, enhance the entry of cells into
      the cell cycle and subsequently regulate their passage through the cycle.

TI  - Cultured Lyt-2- L3T4- T lymphocytes from normal thymus or lpr mice express a
      broad spectrum of cytolytic activity.
PG  - 3734-41
AB  - T lymphocytes expressing the surface phenotype Lyt-2- L3T4- represent a minor
      population of immature thymocytes that appear to be the precursors of mature T
      cells. Cells with the same apparent surface phenotype also accumulate in vast
      numbers in the lymphoid tissues of the autoimmune lpr mouse. Lyt-2- L3T4- T
      lymphocytes from lpr lymph node (LN) or normal thymus express low to undetectable
      levels, respectively, of surface antigen receptor. In addition, they produce
      reduced amounts of lymphokines compared with normal T cells and lack precursors
      of alloantigen-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes. We previously showed that after 
      culture with phorbol esters and interleukin 2, lpr Lyt-2- L3T4- T lymphocytes
      proliferate and differentiate, acquiring increased levels of surface antigen
      receptor by most cells, as well as Lyt-2 by a portion. We now show that cultured 
      Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells from lpr LN or normal thymus are very efficiently cytolytic 
      toward not only allogeneic tumor targets, but also natural killer
      (NK)-susceptible targets and syngeneic targets. Such killing was not inhibited by
      antibodies to H-2 or Lyt-2. In contrast, cultured mature Lyt-2+ L3T4- T cells
      from normal LN, thymus, or lpr LN were cytolytic only toward allogeneic targets
      and were dependent on Lyt-2 expression and H-2 recognition. The similarities of
      cultured Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells to NK and lymphokine-activated killer cells are
      discussed.

TI  - Stoichiometry of contraction and Ca2+ mobilization by inositol
      1,4,5-trisphosphate in isolated gastric smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 16591-6
AB  - Smooth muscle cells were isolated from the circular muscle layer of guinea pig
      stomach and permeabilized by brief exposure to saponin. Both permeabilized and
      intact muscle cells contracted in response to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)
      and acetylcholine, but only permeabilized muscle cells contracted in response to 
      inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). The contractile response to InsP3 was
      prompt (peak less than 5 s), concentration-dependent (EC50-0.3 microM), and
      insensitive to antimycin or oligomycin. Contraction induced by either InsP3 or
      CCK-8 was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in free Ca2+ that was
      directly correlated with the magnitude of contraction. Both InsP3 and CCK-8
      caused rapid net efflux of Ca2+ from cells preloaded with 45Ca2+. Contraction,
      increase in free Ca2+ concentration, and net 45Ca2+ efflux elicited by a
      combination of maximal concentrations of InsP3 and CCK-8 were not significantly
      different from those elicited by maximal concentrations of either agent alone.
      Repeated stimulation of single muscle cells with either InsP3 or CCK-8 in
      Ca2+-free medium caused eventual loss of the contractile response to all agents. 
      The response to all agents was restored upon re-exposure of the cell to a
      cytosol-like concentration of Ca2+, implying equal access of InsP3 and
      receptor-linked agonists to the same intracellular Ca2+ store. The results
      demonstrate that InsP3 mimics the effects of receptor-linked agonists on
      contraction and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in permeabilized smooth muscle
      cells that retain the functional properties of intact smooth muscle cells and
      support a role for InsP3 as membrane-derived messenger responsible for
      mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in smooth muscle cells.

TI  - Calcium modulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release from
      neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid (NG108-15) microsomes.
PG  - 16414-20
AB  - Subcellular fractions of neuroblastoma x glioma (NG108-15) hybrid cells were used
      to study the mechanism of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release. A
      microsomal fraction, enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes and
      almost devoid of mitochondria, was the most active in inositol trisphosphate- or 
      GTP-dependent release of calcium. Neither GTP nor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
      affected the calcium efflux mediated by the other reagent, suggesting that
      inositol trisphosphate and GTP act on different calcium-sequestrating vesicles.
      The stimulation of calcium release by GTP was relatively slow (t1/2 = 90 s),
      dependent on polyethyleneglycol, and greater at 2 X 10(-5) M calcium (5 nmol X
      min-1 X mg-1) than at 10(-6) M calcium (0.8 nmol X min-1 X mg-1). The inositol
      trisphosphate-induced calcium efflux was not mimicked by inositol monophosphate; 
      it was fast (t1/2 less than 10 s) and unaffected by 3% polyethyleneglycol. The
      amount of calcium released by inositol trisphosphate was greatest at 10(-6) M
      external calcium (1 nmol X min-1 X mg-1) and it was undetectable at 2 X 10(-5) M 
      calcium. A feedback inhibition of the inositol trisphosphate-induced calcium
      release by cytoplasmic calcium provides a safety mechanism preventing deleterious
      effects of abnormally high calcium levels.

TI  - Clinical effects and toxicity of interleukin-2 in patients with cancer.
PG  - 2764-72
AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a 15,000 dalton glycoprotein produced naturally by human 
      T-cells during an immune response. IL-2 has been demonstrated to have substantial
      activity alone or in combination with the adoptive transfer of
      lymphokine-activated killer cells in murine tumor models. IL-2 derived from both 
      natural (Jurkat human T-cell tumor) and recombinant (Escherichia coli) sources
      has been studied in Phase I protocols designed to evaluate toxicity in patients
      with a variety of solid tumors and to ascertain improvement in clinical
      parameters and immunologic status. A total of 16 patients (7 with acquired immune
      deficiency syndrome [AIDS] and 9 with non-AIDS malignancies) were treated with
      Jurkat derived IL-2. The total maximum dose (1.3 X 10(5) U/kg) was limited only
      by supply of this reagent. A total of 25 patients have been treated with
      recombinant IL-2 (RIL-2) alone. Dose-limiting toxicity manifested by marked
      malaise and weight gain was achieved with doses of RIL-2 of 10(6) U/kg as a
      single bolus or 3000 U/kg/hr. IL-2 could be administered intraperitoneally with
      similar toxicity. Minimal renal or hepatic toxicity was demonstrated. Hematologic
      toxicity was limited to mild anemia (25/25), thrombocytopenia (10/25), and marked
      reversible eosinophilia (15/25). Pronounced weight gain greater than 2 kg (16/25)
      occurred in most patients, primarily those who received cumulative doses of
      greater than 1-3 X 10(5) U/kg of IL-2. The weight gain amounted to as much as 10%
      to 20% of the pretreatment weight over 3 weeks of treatment and limited our
      ability to give higher doses. Two partial responses (greater than 50% decrease in
      cross sectional diameters) were seen in two patients with melanoma metastatic to 
      the lung.

TI  - Survival after intestinal mucormycosis in acute myelogenous leukemia.
PG  - 2717-9
AB  - A young woman with acute myelocytic leukemia developed acute lower
      gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after a first remission induction of her
      leukemia. After the site of bleeding was located in the descending colon, a
      necrotic bleeding ulcer was resected. Histologic examination of the ulcer
      established the diagnosis of gastrointestinal mucormycosis. Treatment with
      amphotericin B was administered because of the high risk of dissemination. The
      patient has been followed for 9 months with no evidence of relapse of infection. 
      Survival after gastrointestinal mucormycosis in acute leukemia has not previously
      been reported in the English language literature. Success in managing
      mucormycosis depends on the adherence to the recommended principles of early
      aggressive diagnostic measures, excisional surgery, amphotericin B therapy, and
      control of the underlying predisposing condition.

TI  - Active-site directed inactivation of rat ovarian 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid
      dehydrogenase.
PG  - 717-23
AB  - Rat ovarian 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase plays a pivotal role in
      leuteolysis and parturition by catalysing the reduction of progesterone to give
      the progestationally inactive steroid 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Putative
      mechanism based inhibitors of this enzyme were synthesized as potential
      progestational maintaining agents, including the epimeric allylic alcohol pair 3 
      beta-hydroxy-alpha-vinyl-5 alpha-androstane-17 beta-methanol and the related
      vinyl ketone 1-(3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-yl)-2-propen-1-one. The 
      vinyl ketone inactivates rat ovarian 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,
      semi-purified by poly(L-lysine)-agarose column chromatography, in a rapid
      time-dependent manner. Analysis of the pseudo-first-order inactivation plots gave
      a Ki of 2.0 microM for the inhibitor and a t1/2 for the enzyme of 20 s at
      saturation. These data indicate that the vinyl ketone is a potent and efficient
      inactivator of the ovarian dehydrogenase. Neither dialysis in the presence or
      absence of a competing nucleophile nor gel filtration reserves the inactivation, 
      suggesting that a stable covalent bond is formed between the enzyme and steroid
      ligand. Both substrates (20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and NADP+) protect the
      enzyme from inactivation; moreover, initial velocity measurements in the presence
      of saturating concentrations of both substrates indicate that the vinyl ketone
      can behave as a competitive inhibitor, yielding a Ki value identical with that
      obtained in the inactivation experiments. Our results imply that the vinyl ketone
      is an active-site directed alkylating agent. By contrast the allylic alcohol pair
      3 beta-hydroxy-alpha-vinyl-5 alpha-androstane-17 beta-methanol are neither
      substrates nor inhibitors of the ovarian enzyme and appear to be excluded from
      the catalytic site. The rapid inactivation observed with the vinyl ketone
      suggests that this compound may be useful as a progestational maintaining agent.

TI  - Mitogenic effect of bradykinin and of des-Arg9-bradykinin on cultured
      fibroblasts.
PG  - 2351-8
AB  - Bradykinin (BK) and its fragment des-Arg9-BK failed to stimulate thymidine
      incorporation in all but one observed fibroblast cultures derived from human
      amniotic fluid or rabbit dermis. The rabbit dermis fibroblast line designated R51
      acquired the capacity to increase its DNA synthesis in response to kinins after
      several weeks in culture. It was more sensitive to des-Arg9-BK than to BK and the
      effect of both peptides was antagonized by the analog Leu8, des-Arg9-BK; these
      features are shared with certain smooth muscle preparations responsive to kinins 
      such as the rabbit aorta. Recently isolated rabbit dermis or human amniotic
      fibroblasts could not be made responsive to kinins by pre-incubating them with
      bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The line R51 released more PGE2 than baseline when 
      stimulated with BK or des-Arg9-BK at low concentrations; it was also doubling
      faster than recently isolated cells of similar origin.

TI  - Lack of natural luteolysis associated with uterine horn aplasia in a heifer.
PG  - 1585-6
AB  - A heifer with congenital left uterine horn aplasia had completely normal
      reproductive cycles when ovulation occurred from the right ovary. Subsequent to
      ovulation from the left ovary, however, the corpus luteum persisted for months
      unless prostaglandin F2 alpha was administered. The reproductive tract was
      examined after slaughter. The left oviduct ended blindly, resulting in
      fluid-filled cysts. Except for aplasia of the left uterine horn, the reproductive
      tract appeared to be morphologically normal. This natural model confirms that the
      luteolytic signal in cattle is sent from the uterine horn to the ipsilateral
      ovary, but not to the contralateral ovary. Diagnosis of this abnormality required
      careful palpation per rectum. The normal luteolysis that occurred with exogenous 
      prostaglandin F2 alpha treatment provided misleading information that the heifer 
      was normal.

TI  - Unusual cytogenetic findings in two patients with t(4;11) acute leukemia.
PG  - 847-52
AB  - Unusual cytogenetic findings are described in two patients with acute leukemia
      and rearrangements involving chromosomes 4 and 11. Both patients had clinical and
      phenotypic features often found in leukemia with t(4;11)(q21;q23). At initial
      diagnosis, one patient showed a standard t(4;11) with duplication of the
      4q-translocation derivative. The latter finding has been described previously in 
      a few patients with t(4;11) in association with disease progression. By analogy
      with the Ph1 chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia, duplication of the
      4q-suggests that this derivative is the critical recombinant in the t(4;11). The 
      second patient has a novel complex translocation, t(4;11;15)(q21;q23;q21).
      Analysis of this variant translocation implies that the 11q+ is the consistent
      chromosome rearrangement in this type of leukemia. The apparent contradiction of 
      the findings in these and other relevant reported cases reviewed here suggests
      that genes on both the 11q+ and 4q- recombinant chromosomes are important, in
      either the etiology or the progression of this disease.

TI  - Tissue expression of the tumor marker CA 50 in benign and malignant pancreatic
      lesions. A comparison with CA 19-9.
PG  - 841-6
AB  - The expression of the tumor marker antigen CA 50, defined by the monoclonal
      antibody (MAb) C 50, was studied by the immunoperoxidase technique in
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from normal pancreata, from
      pancreata with pancreatitis and from benign and malignant pancreatic neoplasms.
      The results were compared with those obtained with Mab 1116 NS 19-9. The C 50
      antibody reacts, like the 1116 NS 19-9 antibody, with
      sialosylfucosyllactotetraose (corresponding to sialylated blood group antigen
      Lewisa), but also with another sugar moiety, sialosyllactotetraose. Thirty-two of
      37 well- to moderately-differentiated adenocarcinomas and all cystadenocarcinomas
      were positive for CA 50. The staining was most intense in the apical border of
      the cells, and in the intraluminal mucus. The number of positive cells was
      smaller in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and only occasional cells were
      stained in anaplastic carcinomas. In acute and chronic pancreatitis small
      terminal ducts, centro-acinar cells and some large ducts stained for CA 50. In
      normal pancreas only a few small terminal ducts were CA-19-9-positive, whereas
      both ducts and centro-acinar cells were C-50-positive. Normal pancreatic tissue
      adjacent to carcinoma usually stained more strongly for CA 50 than the carcinoma,
      whereas the opposite was true for CA 19-9. Eight out of 11 CA-19-9-negative
      carcinomas were CA-50-positive. Serous cystadenomas and malignant islet-cell
      tumors were focally positive for CA 50, but negative for CA 19-9. It seems
      apparent that the C 50 antibody reacts with another determinant than sialylated
      Lewisa in CA-19-9-negative specimens, serous cystadenomas and malignant
      islet-cell tumors. Serum CA 50 and CA 19-9 levels were determined in 29 patients 
      with pancreatic cancer. The sensitivity was similar for both markers (76%), and
      there was a positive correlation between the serum levels. However, there was no 
      correlation between the serum levels and the histological expression of the CA 50
      and CA 19-9 antigens.

TI  - A t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation in a T-cell leukemia (L1-ALL) with c-myc and
      TcR-alpha chain locus rearrangements.
PG  - 835-40
AB  - Cell lines established from T-cell leukemias have recently been reported to
      exhibit a chromosome translocation t(8;14) involving proto-oncogene c-myc and the
      gene of the T-cell receptor alpha-chain(TcR-alpha). In this work, we have studied
      a case of T-cell leukemia presenting a t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation that was
      found in fresh leukemic cells taken during relapse, but was absent in cells
      collected at diagnosis. Hybridization analysis showed that the breakpoint on
      chromosome 8 was located 3' to the c-myc exon 3. A TcR-alpha-specific original
      probe (D14S7, Mathieu-Mahul et al., 1985) revealed two differently rearranged
      patterns in DNA from leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis and during relapse. In 
      contrast, the rearranged TcR-beta-gene DNA pattern did not change during the
      course of the disease, indicating that leukemic cells were clonally related.
      These data indicate that the chromosome breakpoint in 14q11 is situated in the
      TcR-alpha locus. These results suggest that translocations t(8;14) involving
      TcR-alpha and c-myc genes in T-cell malignancies are analogous to variant t(2;8) 
      and t(8;22) translocations observed in Burkitt lymphoma. They also establish that
      the same types of molecular rearrangements due to a t(8;14)(q24;q11)
      translocation, at first described in T-cell lines established in culture, also
      exist in vivo and may play a role in the evolution of the leukemic process.

      a 110-kDa phosphoprotein as the major phosphorylation product in mouse embryos
      and Krebs II mouse ascites tumor cells.
PG  - 733-8
AB  - Mouse embryos at various stages of development were used to study the
      relationship of protein kinase activities with normal embryogenesis. Casein
      kinase II (CKII) activity in developing mouse embryos shows a 3-4-fold activity
      increase at day 12 of gestation. Together with the CKII activity, increased
      phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein is observed. Treatment of the embryo
      extracts with heparin, a highly specific inhibitor of CKII activity, results in a
      drastic reduction of the 110-kDa protein phosphorylation indicating that the
      protein might be a CKII-specific substrate. Rapidly proliferating mouse tumour
      cells also show an enhanced CKII activity. Here too, a 110-kDa phosphoprotein was
      the major phosphoryl acceptor. Partial proteolytic digestion shows that both
      proteins are identical. Other protein kinases tested (cAMP- and cGMP-dependent
      protein kinases) only show a basal level of enzyme activity with minor
      alterations throughout the different stages of embryogenesis investigated.

TI  - Biochemistry and expression of myelomonocytic antigens.
PG  - 3909-14
AB  - Six monoclonal antibodies (MAb) which react with myelomonocytic cells
      representing various stages of differentiation, and which precipitate six
      different cell surface molecules, were identified. A 50 to 55 kilodalton (Kd)
      glycoprotein, restricted in expression to mature cells of the monocyte lineage,
      was detected by immunoprecipitation with antibody MoS39. By using COS-7 cells
      transfected with a cDNA clone encoding the MoS39 antigen, various well-described 
      anti-monocyte MAb, including Mo2, My4, Leu-M3 (MoP9), MoP15, MoS1, and 63D3, also
      bound to MoS39-expressing COS-7 cells, suggesting that this group of antibodies
      reacted with the same glycoprotein. Immature cells of the myelomonocytic lineage 
      were shown to express two distinct molecules: one with an m.w. of 26 to 28 Kd
      identified by antibody SG133, and the second, a 130 to 140 Kd glycoprotein
      identified by MoU26. Mature granulocytes were found to express a 60 Kd molecule
      identified by antibody SG185 which was absent from other cells of this lineage.
      Two other molecules were shown to be present on both mature and immature cells of
      the granulocytic and monocytic lineages: a 130 to 140 Kd glycoprotein identified 
      by antibody SG134, and a 160 to 170 Kd glycoprotein recognized by antibody MoU48.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta. A very potent inhibitor of myoblast
      differentiation, identical to the differentiation inhibitor secreted by Buffalo
      rat liver cells.
PG  - 16509-13
AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is now known to have a number of
      actions in addition to the induction of phenotypic transformation in fibroblastic
      cells. In this paper, we characterize its inhibition of differentiation in rat
      myoblasts of Yaffe's L6 strain and demonstrate its identity or very close
      similarity to the differentiation inhibitor (DI) secreted by Buffalo rat liver
      cells cultured in serum-free medium. At concentrations as low as 60 pg/ml,
      TGF-beta gave detectable inhibition of differentiation measured as myoblast
      fusion and creatine kinase elevation; maximal inhibition was observed at and
      above 0.5 ng/ml (20 pM). The inhibition persisted as long as fresh TGF-beta was
      added at 48-h intervals, but it was reversed upon removal of the factor. By
      itself or in the presence of mitogens, TGF-beta had no mitogenic activity in the 
      L6 cells. Concentration dependencies of human TGF-beta and the rat DI were
      closely parallel in three assays: inhibition of myoblast differentiation,
      stimulation of normal rat kidney cell growth in soft agar, and competition for
      displacement of labeled TGF-beta from binding sites on A549 human lung carcinoma 
      cells. We conclude that most if not all of the DI activity found in medium
      conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells can be attributed to the presence of
      TGF-beta or a very similar molecule. These observations also offer a potentially 
      useful approach to study the control of myogenesis; the process(es) can be
      blocked in cloned L6 myoblasts by incubation with very small quantities of a pure
      protein in fully defined serum-free medium.

TI  - Factors influencing chelator-stable, detergent-extractable, phorbol
      diester-induced membrane association of protein kinase C. Differences between
      Ca2+-induced and phorbol ester-stabilized membrane bindings of protein kinase C.
PG  - 16438-45
AB  - One of the early events associated with the treatment of cells by tumor promotor 
      phorbol esters is the tight association of protein kinase C to the plasma
      membrane. To better understand the factors that regulate this process, phorbol
      ester-induced membrane binding of protein kinase C was studied using homogenates,
      as well as isolated membranes and purified enzyme. Addition of
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to the homogenates of parietal yolk
      sac cells and NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of Ca2+ resulted in plasma membrane
      binding of protein kinase C which subsequently remained bound to the membrane
      independent of Ca2+. Although protein kinase C was activated by TPA in the
      absence of Ca2+ and by diolein in the presence of Ca2+, both these agents when
      added to homogenates under these respective conditions had no effect on membrane 
      association of protein kinase C. However, under these conditions relatively weak 
      binding of protein kinase C was found if purified protein kinase C was used with 
      isolated membranes. Binding studies using purified protein kinase C and washed
      membranes showed that the binding of the TPA-kinase complex to membranes required
      phospholipids and reached saturation at 0.1 unit (24 ng of protein kinase C)/mg
      of parietal yolk sac cell membrane protein. Phorbol ester treatment of cells in
      media with and without Ca2+ showed that the TPA-induced increase in
      membrane-associated protein kinase C was regulated by Ca2+ levels even in intact 
      cells. TPA-stabilized membrane binding of protein kinase C differs in several
      aspects from the previously reported Ca2+-induced reversible binding.
      TPA-stabilized binding of protein kinase C to isolated membranes is temperature
      dependent, relatively high in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction, saturable at
      physiological levels of protein kinase C, requires the presence of both membrane 
      protein(s) and phospholipids, and further requires the addition of phospholipid
      micelles. In contrast, Ca2+-induced reversible binding is more rapid, not
      appreciably influenced by temperature, not selective for a particular subcellular
      fraction, not saturable with physiological amounts of protein kinase C, exhibits 
      trypsin-insensitive membrane binding sites, and requires membrane phospholipids
      but not added phospholipid micelles.

TI  - Granulocytic sarcoma in nonleukemic patients.
PG  - 2697-709
AB  - Sixteen patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma without evidence of acute
      leukemia were seen and diagnosed at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson
      Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston from 1962 to 1985. Seven of them (44%)
      did not develop acute leukemia. Of these seven, four are alive with no evidence
      of disease 3.5 to 16 years after initial presentation; the remaining three
      patients died of their disease within 2 to 8 months of presentation. Two of 16
      patients were diagnosed within the last 15 months and do not have adequate
      follow-up. The seven remaining patients developed acute leukemia within 1 week to
      13 months of the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma. Six of them died 5 weeks to
      16 months after diagnosis; one patient has been in complete remission for 8
      years. Twelve of these 16 cases (75%) were initially misdiagnosed, most
      frequently as large cell lymphoma. The remaining four cases were correctly
      diagnosed as granulocytic sarcoma. The naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase stain 
      was required to make the correct diagnosis in all cases. Contrary to findings in 
      other series, granulocytic sarcoma arising in nonleukemic patients does not
      necessarily progress to acute leukemia. At least four of 16 (25%) patients in
      this series did not develop acute leukemia during the 3.5 to 16 years they have
      been followed. No prognostic factors were identified in this series to predict
      which patients would develop acute leukemia and which ones would not.

      lymphoblastic leukemia with vacuolated blasts.
PG  - 2632-9
AB  - Among 65 consecutive patients with untreated adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL), six had peculiar clinical and cytologic features. Bone marrow and
      circulating blasts were large and showed prominent vacuolization, with variable
      degree of granular periodic acid-Schiff positivity in the cytoplasm. All patients
      had marked spleen and liver enlargement with cholestasis and without either lymph
      node or central nervous system disease. They achieved complete response to
      chemotherapy, and their median survival was longer than 12 months. Blast cells
      were studied for immunologic markers, propidium iodide flow cytofluorometric DNA 
      content, and in vitro tritiated thymidine labeling index (3H-TdR LI). These
      showed a "null" phenotype in two cases, contained intracytoplasmic
      immunoglobulins (Cy mu) in two and were positive for CALL and Ia antigens in two 
      others (one of which also contained Cy mu). Surface immunoglobulins (SIg) were
      found on less than 12% of cells, and T-cell markers were absent. In five cases,
      one or two stem lines with highly abnormal modal DNA content were found to
      coexist with diploid blasts. The 3H-TdR LI was high (8.5%-15.5%). Abnormal cell
      lines, after being cleared by chemotherapy, were found again at relapse.
      Additional cell lines appeared during the course of the disease in one patient,
      having different sensitivity to cytostatics. These cases of ALL apparently derive
      from B-cells not yet expressing SIg and have an exceptionally high incidence of
      aneuploid cell lines.

TI  - Cloning and expression of human apolipoprotein D cDNA.
PG  - 16535-9
AB  - The amino acid sequence of human apolipoprotein D, a component of high density
      lipoprotein, has been obtained from the cloned cDNA sequence. The 169-amino acid 
      protein has no marked similarity to other apolipoprotein sequences, but has a
      high degree of homology to plasma retinol-binding protein and other members of
      the alpha 2u-globulin protein superfamily. Apolipoprotein D mRNA has been
      detected in human liver, intestine, pancreas, kidney, placenta, adrenal, spleen, 
      and fetal brain tissue. Tissue culture cells transfected with the cloned cDNA
      secrete material that reacts with anti-apoD antibodies.

TI  - Measurement of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) with an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on three murine monoclonal antibodies.
PG  - 411-4
AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of
      urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) was developed. Three murine
      monoclonal antibodies to single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator
      (scu-PA) were isolated and shown to react with non-overlapping epitopes in
      scu-PA. Two of the three antibodies were coated onto microtiter plates and bound 
      u-PA was quantitated with the third antibody conjugated to horseradish
      peroxidase. The assay was equally sensitive to Mr 54,000 u-PA in the single chain
      or two-chain form but did not respond to Mr 33,000 urokinase. The lower limit of 
      sensitivity of the assay was 0.1 ng/ml in buffer and 1 ng/ml in plasma.
      Coefficients of variation of the assay at physiological levels of u-PA were 6.5
      percent within assays and 13 percent between assays. The level of u-PA in normal 
      resting plasma was 1.9 +/- 0.66 ng/ml (mean +/- SD, n = 54). The assay can be
      performed within one working day and provides an efficient, reproducible, and
      stable means for the measurement of u-PA in biological fluids. As such it may
      facilitate physiological and pharmacological studies of urokinase-type
      plasminogen activators in man.

TI  - Differential detection of single-chain and two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen
      activator by a new immunoadsorbent-amidolytic assay (IAA).
PG  - 407-10
AB  - A new immunoadsorbent-amidolytic assay (IAA) for the specific differential
      detection of two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (tcu-PA) and its
      single-chain precursor (scu-PA) in cell culture supernatants has been developed. 
      The assay combines the selectivity of immunoassays with the specificity of enzyme
      activity assays exploiting both the antigenic and enzymatic properties of the two
      proteins. tcu-PA and scu-PA are selectively immunoadsorbed on the wells of a
      microtiterplate coated with the monoclonal antibody 5B4 and tested for enzymatic 
      activity before and after activation by plasmin treatment. Both proteins are
      determined with similar efficiency since overlapping dose-response curves were
      obtained in the range between 12.5-200 ng/ml. The assay has been used to
      determine tcu-PA and scu-PA in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cell supernatants.
      The analytical recoveries for tcu-PA and scu-PA added to A431 cell supernatants
      were 95.2% and 96.9% respectively. The intra- and inter-assay variations (CV)
      were 5.5% and 9.0% for tcu-PA and 9.7% and 9.8% for scu-PA respectively.

      one-stage assay, two-stage assay and a chromogenic substrate assay.
PG  - 353-9
AB  - Factor VIII:C recovery and half-life was measured in 16 hemophilia A patients
      under comprehensively standardized conditions. Each patient received the same lot
      of a steam-treated high purity FVIII concentrate at a dose of 19-33 U/kg body
      weight. A comparison was made between the one-stage assay, the two-stage assay
      and a chromogenic substrate test for FVIII:C determination using a FXa-sensitive 
      chromogenic substrate. Factor VIII:C potency of the administered FVIII
      concentrate was measured using calibration curves derived from a concentrate
      standard and FVIII:C plasma levels were read from calibration curves derived from
      a plasma standard. The chromogenic assay showed a good reproducibility at FVIII:C
      levels between 0.015 and 0.50 U/ml. The FVIII:C recoveries calculated from the
      results of the one-stage assay, the two-stage assay and the chromogenic substrate
      test were 109 +/- 20, 92 +/- 14 and 81 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD), respectively. The
      elimination half-lives of FVIII:C were calculated by non-linear least square
      analysis using a modified computerized Gauss-Newton algorithm. The half-lives
      calculated from the FVIII:C plasma levels measured by the one-stage assay, the
      two-stage assay and the chromogenic test were 23.8 +/- 6.4, 22.2 +/- 5.7 and 17.1
      +/- 4.8 h (mean +/- SD), respectively. No previous study has reported such long
      half-life values. Our findings indicate that measurements of recoveries and
      half-lives by the chromogenic FVIII:C assay and by computerized non-linear least 
      square analysis allow the possibility of individualized FVIII replacement
      therapy.

TI  - Further characterization of wheat germ agglutinin interaction with human
      platelets: exposure of fibrinogen receptors.
PG  - 323-7
AB  - It was previously shown that Wheat germ agglutinin, (WGA)-induced platelet
      activation occurred when only 17% of the lectin binding sites were occupied on
      the platelet surface and WGA caused the release of a platelet constituent which
      in turn participates in the observed effect. We now further define the platelet
      activation induced by WGA: the lectin induces a binding of fibrinogen to specific
      surface receptors. 125I-fibrinogen binding increases with the WGA concentration
      from 5 to 15 micrograms/ml. Binding occurs without addition of exogenous calcium;
      its analysis demonstrated 54,000 sites with a Ka = 0.8 X 10(6) M-1. Addition of 1
      mM Ca2+ enhances the 125I-fibrinogen binding and reveals a second class of sites 
      with higher affinity (9200 sites, Ka = 0.17 X 10(8) M-1). This 125I-fibrinogen
      binding is totally abolished by EDTA, ATP and arginine, and inhibited by 75% by
      CP/CPK; cyclooxygenase inhibitors and PGE1 also reduce the fibrinogen binding.
      Thus the WGA-induced fibrinogen binding is release-dependent and responsible for 
      the aggregation process but not for the agglutinating effect of the lectin.

      administration of arachidonic acid--effect of cyclooxygenase and thromboxane
      synthetase inhibitors.
PG  - 311-7
AB  - Intravenous administration of arachidonic acid to guinea-pigs caused a
      dose-related, rapid accumulation of 51Cr-labelled platelets in the thorax.
      Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase inhibited the platelet accumulation, induced by
      arachidonic acid (30 mg/kg), at doses which did not alter the thoracic blood
      volume (as measured by 131I-labelled human albumin). Thromboxane synthetase
      inhibitors had different effects on platelet accumulation depending on the dose. 
      CGS 12970 (3 mg/kg) and N(1-carboxyheptyl) imidazole (100 mg/kg) reduced platelet
      accumulation. High doses of CGS 12970 and CGS 13080 caused an apparent
      enhancement of platelet accumulation which was associated with pooling of blood
      in the thorax, as measured by either 131I-labelled human albumin or 51Cr-labelled
      erythrocytes. This increase in thoracic blood volume was abolished if the
      guinea-pigs were also pretreated with diclofenac (1 mg/kg) in addition to the
      thromboxane synthetase inhibitor. Increases in thoracic blood volume were also
      obtained following infusions of PGI2 but not PGD2 or PGE2.

PG  - 299-301
AB  - The bioavailability of human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in 
      rats was measured after subcutaneous (s.c.) and intramuscular (i.m.) injection.
      Rt-PA was absorbed after both i.m. and s.c. injection, giving peak plasma
      concentrations within 30 min and 1 h, respectively, with detectable
      concentrations up to 6 h. These peak values of bioavailable t-PA were obtained in
      a functional fibrin plate assay of euglobulin precipitates and expressed as +88% 
      and +243% (for s.c. and i.m. routes respectively) above basal rat fibrinolytic

TI  - The interaction of the factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex with hematin.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - Intravenous infusion of hematin, used in the treatment of acute porphyria,
      induces a decline in the plasma factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex
      (VIII/vWF) and thrombocytopenia. We investigated this problem by studying the
      interaction between hematin, purified VIII/vWF, and platelets in vitro. Hematin
      was labeled with either 59Fe or 3H and characterized by gel chromatography.
      Hematin self-aggregated, forming a complex with an average molecular weight of
      approximately 10,000 daltons. When incubated with VIII/vWF for 30 min at 37
      degrees C and applied to Sepharose CL-4B, the hematin eluted with the VIII/vWF in
      the void volume. Hematin inhibited the dissociation of factor VIII antigen
      (VIII:Ag) from the von Willebrand antigen (vWF:Ag) in 0.25 M CaCl2, and reversed 
      the aggregation of VIII:Ag induced by 0.1 M 6-aminocaproic acid. Both hematin and
      the hematin-VIII/vWF complex bound to washed normal platelets and to platelets
      from a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Thrombasthenic platelets were not
      aggregatable by hematin, and bound significantly less hematin-VIII/vWF than
      normal platelets suggesting that hematin-induced platelet activation was required
      for binding. Likewise, binding was inhibited by PGE1 which also prevented
      aggregation. We conclude that hematin forms complexes with VIII/vWF, alters the
      functional activity and dissociation of this compound, and participates in the
      binding of VIII/vWF to platelets.

AB  - The effects of intravenously administered collagen on the circulatory platelet
      count, TxB2, 6-keto PGF1 alpha and 51Cr-labelled platelet accumulation in the
      thorax have been evaluated in the guinea-pig. Administration of collagen induced 
      a dose-related peripheral thrombocytopenia and a concomitant increase in
      51Cr-labelled platelets in the thorax. There was also a transient dose-related
      increase in plasma TxB2 but no change in plasma 6-keto PGF1 alpha levels. The
      thromboxane synthetase inhibitors tested, reduced the platelet accumulation, but 
      only CGS 13080 significantly inhibited TxB2 production. In contrast all the
      cyclooxygenase inhibitors tested impaired the elevation of plasma TxB2 after
      collagen, but only diclofenac inhibited the 51Cr-labelled platelet accumulation. 
      The greater effect of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors compared to
      cyclooxygenase inhibitors on platelet accumulation in this system cannot be
      completely explained by the changes measured in the circulating prostanoids.

TI  - Genetic control of glycolipid expression.
PG  - 75-90
AB  - A polymorphic variation of sialic acid species of sialosyllactosylceramide was
      found in dog erythrocytes. The analysis of the glycolipids in the erythrocytes of
      the individual dogs in a family of a Japanese breed of dog, Shiba-Inu, showed
      that the expression of sialosyllactosylceramide containing N-glycolylneuraminic
      acid was an autosomal dominant trait over the expression of that containing
      N-acetylneuraminic acid. Polymorphic variations of major liver gangliosides were 
      also found in various strains of inbred mice. The strains were classified into
      three groups; the first group possessed only II3 NeuGc-LacCer, the second group
      possessed II3NeuGc-GgOse3Cer in addition to II3NeuGc-LacCer and the third group
      possessed II3NeuGc-GgOse4Cer and II3NeuGc,IV3NeuGc-GgOse4Cer as well as the above
      two gangliosides. By subjecting mice of these three groups to genetic analysis,
      the strain of the first group (WHT/Ht mice) was demonstrated to be a recessive
      homozygote which had a single autosomal defective gene making it unable to
      express N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity to produce II3NeuGc-GgOse3Cer.
      The strains of the second group (BALB/c and C57BL/10 mice) were also demonstrated
      to be recessive homozygotes which had a single autosomal defective gene making
      them unable to express high enough level of galactosyltransferase activity to
      produce II3NeuGc-GgOse4Cer. By the analysis of gangliosides and the enzyme
      activity of H-2 congenic mice and mice produced by a mating, this defective gene 
      controlling the expression of II3NeuGc-GgOse4-Cer through the regulation of the
      transferase activity was demonstrated to be linked to H-2 complex on chromosome
      17.

TI  - Influence of temperature on the enzymic semisynthesis of human insulin by
      coupling and transpeptidation methods.
PG  - 803-10
AB  - The influence of temperature of enzymic semisynthesis of human insulin ester was 
      determined by using coupling and transpeptidation methods with trypsin and
      Achromobacter lyticus proteinase I as catalysts. The optimal reaction conditions 
      were studied at the selected temperatures of 25, 12 and 4 degrees C. The results 
      showed that the synthesis rates by both methods with trypsin increased as the
      temperature increased, but the final product yield correspondingly decreased.
      Therefore the reaction with trypsin should be done below 12 degrees C, preferably
      at 4 degrees C. This agrees well with the stability of trypsin at these
      temperatures. When the catalyst was Achromobacter lyticus proteinase I, no such
      complex temperature effects were observed, and the findings indicated that the
      reactions should be conducted below 37 degrees C for enzyme stability.

      progress in the quasi-continuity model.
PG  - 105-16
AB  - The recent progress in the quasi-continuity model and its applications in
      studying the low-frequency internal motions of biological macromolecules have
      been surveyed. Emphasis is placed on revealing the origin of this kind of
      internal collective motion, which involves many atoms and has significant
      biological functions. In light of such a line, the low-frequency motions in
      alpha-helix structure, beta-structure (including beta-sheet and beta-barrel), and
      DNA double-helix structure, the three most fundamental component elements in
      biological macromolecules, are discussed, and the corresponding physical pictures
      described. It turns out that the low-frequency motion in biological
      macromolecules originates from their two common intrinsic characteristics, i.e., 
      they possess a series of weak bonds, such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and
      a substantial mass distributed over the region containing those weak bonds.

TI  - [Evaluation of the parameters used in monitoring hypothyroid patients treated
      with L-thyroxine].
PG  - 2227-33
AB  - Hormonal and clinical data on 38 tests performed in 7 hypothyroid patients given 
      substitutive treatment with L-thyroxin were analysed. The aim of the survey was
      to assess the dependability of the various parameters used to estimate dose
      adequacy in substitutive treatment. Examination of individual cases revealed that
      overdoses of thyroxin increased T4 to above normal limits without increases in
      T3, FT3, FT4 or hypophyseal suppression. Chronological discrepancies between
      clinical data and normal parameters were also noted. However on the data as a
      whole significant correlations were noted between T4 and TSH (p less than 0.001),
      between T4 and delta-TSH (p less than 0.001), between T3 and TSH p less than
      0.01), between FT3 and delta-TSH (p less than 0.01), between FT4 and delta-TSH (p
      less than 0.01). FT4 and delta-TSH were also significantly correlated (p less
      than 0.02) with the Billewicz clinical index of hypothyroidism. It is concluded
      that the clinical and hormonal data in treated hypothyroid cases have the same
      significance as in normal or untreated hypothyroid cases. However, it must be
      borne in mind that unusual relations between the various thyroid hormone
      fractions including TSH and the standardised clinical examination may arise while
      doses are being established. In this case the data cannot be automatically
      interpreted but merely carefully assessed in the light of experience.

TI  - Effect of fenoprofen on thyroid function tests.
PG  - 233-8
AB  - We observed that a few patients taking the anti-inflammatory drug fenoprofen
      showed increases in total and free T3 serum levels without convincing evidence of
      an associated thyrotoxicosis. To confirm these findings, two volunteers were
      given fenoprofen for two weeks. Within this time total T3 levels almost doubled
      and free T3 levels increased threefold. Administration of fenoprofen did not have
      any measurable effect on T4 or TSH estimations. Cross-reactivities of fenoprofen 
      and 4'-hydroxyfenoprofen were studied with antisera from various total and free
      T3 assays. Results show that the metabolite cross-reacts with the antisera from
      Amerlex total and free T3 assay kits. A lesser degree of interference was
      observed with the Corning total and free T3 assays. 4'-hydroxyfenoprofen had no
      effect on an 'in house' total T3 assay. Laboratories should therefore be aware of
      the possibility that their assay may be subject to interference by fenoprofen or 
      its metabolites while clinicians should be aware of this interference in order
      that they may avoid unnecessary and harmful treatment.

TI  - Apolipoprotein profile in healthy males and its relation to maximum aerobic
      capacity (MAC).
PG  - 165-71
AB  - In order to document possible variations of apolipoproteins in relation to the
      maximum aerobic capacity, 36 healthy young males of different aerobic performance
      were examined and the serum concentrations of apolipoprotein A-I, A-II, B, C-II, 
      C-III, E investigated. In contrast to all other lipoproteins, significant
      differences between the endurance-trained and control subjects could be found in 
      the apo A-I concentrations only (1025 +/- 92 vs 1456 +/- 179 mg/l, p less than
      0.001). In addition, the apolipoprotein A-II, B, C-II, C-III, E concentrations
      correlated neither with the maximum aerobic capacity values nor with the relative
      body weight of the subjects.

TI  - In vitro translation of mushroom tyrosinase.
PG  - 697-703
AB  - Mushroom tyrosinase was purified and antibodies prepared against the holo enzyme 
      and a protein of 26,000 daltons. Both antibodies recognized the large subunit of 
      the enzyme but only one recognized the 26,000 dalton protein. Poly A+ mRNA was
      isolated from mushrooms, translated in vitro, and a 41,000 dalton protein
      immunoprecipitated from the translation mix with either antibody. This 41,000
      dalton protein presumably corresponds to the large subunit of the holoenzyme.
      Antibodies against the holoenzyme also immunoprecipitated another translation
      product with a molecular weight of 15,000 daltons corresponding to the small
      subunit of the holoenzyme. These results suggest that each subunit may be coded
      for by different genes and undergo posttranslational processing.

TI  - Carbamylcholine, TRH, PGF2 alpha and fluoride enhance free intracellular Ca++ and
      Ca++ translocation in dog thyroid cells.
PG  - 569-77
AB  - Effects on Ca++ translocation and [Ca++]i were studied in dog thyroid cell
      monolayers using both 45Ca++ efflux and the indicator quin-2. Carbamylcholine, a 
      non hydrolysable analog of acetylcholine, through muscarinic receptors, and to a 
      lesser extent TRH and PGF2 alpha increased both these parameters. [Ca++]i
      increased by 171, 100 and 75% respectively over a basal level of 66 +/- 17 nM
      (mean +/- SD). The response to carbamylcholine was biphasic. A transient increase
      in [Ca++]i was followed by a more sustained phase where the [Ca++]i was slightly 
      higher than the basal level. Only the first phase was insensitive to
      extracellular Ca++ depletion. This phase is probably due to a release of Ca++
      from an intracellular store. NaF also induced a sustained rise in [Ca++]i
      dependent on extracellular Ca++ and affected 45Ca++ efflux. Our data provide
      direct evidence of an implication of intracellular Ca++ in the response of dog
      thyroid cells to all these agents.

TI  - Modulation of rat polymorphonuclear leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity by 5-HPETE 
      and NADH-dependent flavin inhibition.
PG  - 534-40
AB  - The effect of nicotinamide and flavin coenzymes on the 5-lipoxygenase activity
      has been determined in cell-free extracts from rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes. 
      5-lipoxygenase was assayed in the presence of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid 
      (5-HPETE), which caused a 3 to 4-fold stimulation in the maximal conversion of
      radiolabeled arachidonic acid to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and
      5,12-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5,12-di-HETE). Addition of FMN or FAD to the
      assay mixture had little effect on the 5-lipoxygenase activity and caused
      inhibition only at high concentrations (IC50 greater than 100 microM). NADH
      markedly potentiated the inhibition of lipoxygenase by flavins with a 100-fold
      decrease in the FMN concentration required to inhibit the enzyme (IC50
      approximately equal to 2 microM). Similar effects were observed for FAD although 
      this flavin derivative was slightly less potent than FMN (IC50 congruent to 10
      microM). NADH could be substituted by NADPH but not by NAD or NADP, indicating
      that the inhibition was not due to the production of the oxidized forms of these 
      co-factors. These results show that the 5-lipoxygenase activity is stimulated by 
      5-HPETE and inhibited by flavin-dependent redox transformations.

PG  - 528-33
AB  - Two isoforms of heme oxygenase, designated as HO-1 and HO-2, were identified in
      rat spleen. The most abundant form was HO-1, wherein a relative ratio of about
      5:1 of HO-1 to HO-2 was detected. The splenic HO-1 and HO-2 were immunochemically
      similar to the purified isoforms obtained from the liver and the testis.
      Moreover, the elution properties of splenic HO-1 as well as those of the
      constitutive liver HO-1 and the hematin-induced liver HO-1 on a DEAE-sephacel
      column were similar. However, the splenic HO-1 activity could not be induced by
      hematin. It is suggested that in the spleen heme oxygenase activity is maintained
      in the induced state as the result of constant exposure to hemoglobin released in
      the course of disruption of senescent erythrocytes.

AB  - Upon exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, interleukin 2 receptor+ T 
      cells transiently accumulate neopterin and biopterin as was determined by HPLC
      after iodine oxidation of acidic cell extracts. Pteridines peak at maximally 20
      fold levels after 10-20 min and return to initial levels during the following
      30-40 min. Resting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells do not react within
      this short period. TPA elicits similar neopterin and biopterin accumulation
      kinetics in cell lines such as HL-60, Reh, Jurkat JMN, HeLa and 293, whereby
      HL-60 and Reh release substantial amounts of these transiently formed pteridines 
      into the medium.

PG  - 474-81
AB  - A Drosophila cDNA clone was obtained using the human insulin receptor cDNA
      sequence as a probe. The 3586 bp nucleotide sequence predicted a single
      polypeptide of 1095 amino acid residues which showed considerable homology
      (35.2%) with the human insulin receptor precursor. Although the cDNA was
      incomplete at its 5'-terminal region, it encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein as 
      a single precursor of a two subunit molecule having a structural architecture
      similar to that of the human insulin receptor precursor. The presumptive beta
      subunit carries a well conserved Tyr kinase domain which showed 63.5% homology
      with that of human insulin receptor; however the protein of the alpha subunit is 
      only weakly conserved (25%).

TI  - HSP 26 and 27 are phosphorylated in response to heat shock and ecdysterone in
      Drosophila melanogaster cells.
PG  - 426-33
AB  - Protein phosphorylation has been studied in Drosophila melanogaster 8.9 K cells
      following heat shock. By in vivo double labelling with [35S]-methionine and
      [32P]-orthophosphate, we observed that two proteins are newly phosphorylated
      among the 26,000-27,000 dalton heat-shock proteins group. These two proteins are 
      also phosphorylated after ecdysterone treatment, albeit at a lower level. That
      this phosphorylation event is induced by two different treatments, i.e.
      ecdysterone, a key steroid hormone of development, and heat-shock, a cellular
      stress suggests a possible common pathway for those two events and an important
      function for the phosphorylated heat-shock proteins.

TI  - Induction of cytochrome P-450 in Streptomyces griseus by soybean flour.
PG  - 405-10
AB  - Soybean flour and the isoflavonoid genistein, were found to induce cytochrome
      P-450 in Streptomyces griseus. The chromophore was found in the 105,000xg
      supernatant and gave a reduced CO-difference spectrum with an absorption maximum 
      of 448 nm. Almost 70% of the P-450 could be precipitated at 35-45% ammonium
      sulfate saturation. SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a 45,000
      dalton polypeptide in extracts induced by either soybean or genistein. S. griseus
      generated the free isoflavonoids genistein and daidzein when grown on soybean
      flour medium.

TI  - The 3-methylcholanthrene-mimetic effect of 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl-treatment on
      phenacetin-induced hepatic glutathione depletion and liver microsomal phenacetin 
      O-deethylation in rats.
PG  - 259-74
AB  - Both 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl (4,4'-DCB) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) caused a
      substantial increase of phenacetin-induced hepatic glutathione (GSH) depletion,
      whereas phenobarbital (PB) had no effect, suggesting that 4,4'-DCB possesses
      cytochrome P-448 inducing activity. The O-deethylation of phenacetin by liver
      microsomes from control and PB- and 4,4'-DCB-treated rats showed biphasic
      Michaelis-Menten kinetics, in contrast to the monophasic course after
      pretreatment with 3-MC. Hepatic phenacetin levels indicated that in vivo
      interaction with only a high affinity site is involved in the O-deethylation of
      phenacetin. 4,4'-DCB and 3-MC caused marked increases in intrinsic clearance and 
      extraction ratio of phenacetin, whereas control values were obtained after
      PB-treatment. Because of an absence of a spectral change at low phenacetin
      concentrations, it could not be demonstrated whether the observed differences in 
      metabolism should be ascribed to a change in binding of phenacetin to cytochrome 
      P-450. The results of this study indicate that after pretreatment with various
      enzyme inducers the phenacetin-induced hepatic GSH depletion strongly correlates 
      with microsomal phenacetin O-deethylation. Further, these findings suggest a
      discrepancy between 4,4'-DCB and PB in cytochrome P-450 inducing activity, as
      4,4'-DCB mimics 3-MC in the induction of phenacetin O-deethylase. The difference 
      between 4,4'-DCB and PB is discussed in relation to the multiplicity and
      induction of cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes.

TI  - Effect of cobra venom phospholipase A2 on platelet aggregation in comparison with
      those produced by arachidonic acid and lysophophatidylcholine.
PG  - 875-86
AB  - Cobra venom phospholipase A2 induced a biphasic effect on washed rabbit
      platelets. The first phase was a reversible aggregation which was dependent on
      stirring and extracellular calcium. The aggregation and thromboxane B2 formation 
      were inhibited by indomethacin, mepacrine, tetracaine and imipramine, while PGE1 
      and sodium nitroprusside inhibited only the aggregation, but not the thromboxane 
      B2 formation. The second phase was an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation
      induced by arachidonic acid, PAF, ADP or collagen but not that by thrombin or
      ionophore A23187. The longer the incubation time of cobra venom phospholipase A2 
      with platelets, the more the inhibitory effect. The aggregating and
      anti-aggregating effects could be overcome by bovine serum albumin.
      Lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) and arachidonic acid showed synergistic
      inhibition in platelet aggregation. Lyso-PC decreased thromboxane B2 formation in
      platelets formed by collagen. The inhibitory effect of Lyso-PC on platelet
      aggregation was more marked at lower calcium concentrations. It is concluded that
      the aggregating effect of exogenous addition of venom phospholipase A2 is due to 
      thromboxane formation and the antiplatelet effect is similar to those produced by
      arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine.

PG  - 859-66
AB  - The platelet membrane contains sulfhydryl groups which are essential for normal
      platelet function. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and other thiols such as cysteine
      and 6-mercaptopurine were found to inhibit human platelet aggregation induced by 
      adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen and arachidonic acid. The inhibition of
      ADP-induced aggregation by GSH (IC50 = 0.61 +/- 0.05 mM) was greater than that by
      cysteine (IC50 = 13 +/- 1 mM) or 6-mercaptopurine (IC50 = 5.4 +/- 0.2 mM). Two
      other thiols, dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol were found to cause
      platelet aggregation instead of inhibition. The interaction of GSH with the ADP
      receptor was noncompetitive in nature.

      activity.
PG  - 849-57
AB  - Poly-L-lysine and certain mixed polymers of L-lysine and other amino acids modify
      the activity of one- and two-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)
      towards its substrates. In particular the rate of plasminogen activation in the
      presence of optimal poly-L-lysine concentrations, is increased by approximately
      100-fold. In contrast, activity towards a small synthetic substrate is inhibited 
      by 85%. These effects are observed with both the one- and two-chain forms of
      t-PA. The use of poly-L-lysines in a coupled assay system optimised for t-PA and 
      plasmin activities allows the reproducible assay of t-PA at the 10(-12) to
      10(-13) molar level.

TI  - Release of both urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator from veins in vitro.
PG  - 729-37
AB  - Specimens of human veins were incubated in culture media, in which the
      concentrations of urokinase (UK) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were
      determined by radioimmunoassay and immunoradiometric assay. Both UK and t-PA were
      released to the media, in which the concentration of plasminogen activators was
      correlated to the weight of the specimens. The release of t-PA was maximal on the
      first day, after which it rapidly decreased, and t-PA was not demonstrable after 
      the third day of incubation. By contrast, UK was continuously liberated to the
      media during the study period of 5 days. The present results indicate that both
      UK and t-PA are present in the vein wall and probably released by different
      cells.

TI  - Hypercoagulable states and venous thrombosis.
PG  - 88C-88T, 88Y-88Z, 88DD
AB  - Many factors predispose patients to thromboembolic disease. A young person
      presenting with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis may never have its etiology
      elucidated, despite exhaustive testing. On the other hand, hypercoagulability is 
      no mystery in an obese, bedridden, postoperative patient with a malignancy.
      Invasive or noninvasive testing should be performed in all suspicious cases.
      Patients with positive results should be treated promptly; those with negative
      findings should not be subjected to anticoagulation. The length of
      anticoagulation depends on the length of time the patient remains at risk of
      thrombosis and may vary from months to a lifetime. Patients over 40 should
      receive prophylactic minidose heparin for abdominal and thoracic surgery.
      Patients undergoing hip surgery require some form of anticoagulation--be it
      heparin, warfarin, aspirin, or dihydroergotamine-heparin. Because of lower
      morbidity and superior long-term efficacy, transvenous devices are favored over
      surgical techniques for inferior vena caval interruption.

TI  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a dog from Oklahoma.
PG  - 1583-4
AB  - A dog with signs of weakness, labored breathing, and generalized edema was
      examined. It was heavily infested with fleas and had wounds resulting from a
      recent fight. Hematologic findings were not remarkable, except for parasites in
      the blood. The dog was treated for fleas and given antibiotics, but was
      euthanatized when it failed to respond. Blood and tissue specimens were found to 
      contain Trypanosoma cruzi, and the serum contained antibodies to the organism. We
      believe this is the first confirmed case of T cruzi infection in dogs from
      Oklahoma. The public health implications of this finding are underscored by a
      report on the detection of T cruzi in raccoons in the same season and geographic 
      area.

TI  - A unique nucleoprotein structure associated with the Drosophila melanogaster
      18-28 S rDNA nontranscribed spacer.
PG  - 340-6
AB  - We have detected unique nucleoprotein particles specific for the 18-28 S rDNA
      nontranscribed spacer of Drosophila melanogaster. The particles migrate between
      di- and trinucleosomes on nucleoprotein gels, and are between mono- and
      dinucleosomal in DNA length. These migration properties suggest that the
      nontranscribed spacer particles could have a protein component larger than a
      histone core. The variant nucleoprotein structures map primarily within the
      nontranscribed spacer 235 base pair internal subrepeat, which is AT-rich and
      possesses a 50 base pair sequence homologous to the RNA polymerase I binding
      site.

      alveolar macrophages under non-stimulated conditions.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - Data are presented on the formation of a linoleic acid oxygenation product under 
      basal conditions by guinea pig alveolar macrophages (AM). Under non-stimulated
      conditions 20 X 10(6) AM released about 1 nmol 9-hydroxylinoleic acid (9-HODE)
      during a 15 min incubation. Furthermore, AM released more than 2 nmol
      12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT), a byproduct of the formation of
      thromboxane A2. 9-HODE and HHT were the most prominent products formed under the 
      incubation conditions used. These products were formed via a
      cyclooxygenase-catalyzed reaction, since their formation was inhibited by 1
      microM indomethacin. Thus, under basal conditions AM possess substantial
      cyclooxygenase activity. The biological significance of 9-HODE and related
      substances is discussed.

TI  - Lipid peroxidation in regenerating rat liver.
PG  - 191-6
AB  - Rats entrained to a strictly regulated lighting and feeding schedule have been
      subjected to partial hepatectomy or a sham operation. In the partially
      hepatectomised animals the period of liver regeneration is characterised by
      regular bursts of thymidine kinase activity. Liver microsomes from rats, at times
      corresponding to maximum thymidine kinase activity, have much reduced rates of
      lipid peroxidation compared to control preparations: this is due in part to
      increased levels of lipid-soluble antioxidant at times of maximal DNA synthesis. 
      This temporal relationship between thymidine kinase and lipid peroxidation is
      consistent with the view that lipid peroxidation is decreased prior to cell
      division.

AB  - The amino acid sequence of the protein HMb, a protein of 93 residues (Mr 10757)
      which represents the major acid-soluble component of the Methanosarcina barkeri
      nucleoprotein complex, has been established from automated sequence analysis of
      the protein and from structural data provided by peptides derived from cleavage
      of the protein at aspartic acid, arginine and methionine residues. The protein
      HMb is mainly characterized by a high amount of charged residues (15% of acidic
      residues and 26.8% of basic residues) which are distributed all along the
      polypeptide chain. The amino acid sequence of the protein HMb is not homologous
      to any eubacterial, archaebacterial or eukaryotic chromosomal proteins known up
      to now.

TI  - Synthetic seleno-organic compound with glutathione peroxidase-like activity in
      the chick.
PG  - 4505-9
AB  - The glutathione peroxidase activity catalyzed by the seleno-organic
      anti-inflammatory drug Ebselen (registered under the trademark of the Natterman
      Corp. Cologne, FRG) [PZ51, 2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)on], as measured by
      NADPH oxidation, was inhibited in vitro by the selenium-dependent glutathione
      peroxidase (SeGSHpx) inhibitors aurothioglucose and D-(-)penicillamine HCl.
      Vitamin E- and selenium-deficient chicks were given 0, 80 or 320 ppm PZ51 in
      diets devoid of vitamin E and supplemented with low levels of sodium selenite
      (0.04 ppm selenium added to the basal diet containing ca. 0.015 ppm selenium)
      when a small number of chicks (ca. 13%) had exudative diathesis (ED). By 24 hr,
      the high PZ51 dose (320 ppm) delayed the onset of ED compared to untreated
      controls. Similarly, vitamin E-deficient chicks fed diets containing 0, 80, 160, 
      320, 640 or 1280 ppm PZ51 and supplemented with 0.04 ppm selenium showed ED in
      inverse proportion to log PZ51 dose. Plasma and liver post-mitochondrial
      supernatant samples from these chicks also exhibited log-linear relationships
      between dietary PZ51 level and selenium content or SeGSHpx-like activity. The
      amount of SeGSHpx-like activity for chicks given PZ51 above that determined for
      untreated chicks was extractable into ethanol, indicating that those
      PZ51-associated increases were not due to protein-bound selenium or SeGSHpx. This
      suggests that selenium from PZ51 was not available to support synthesis of
      SeGSHpx. Dietary PZ51 (1280 ppm) or selenium (0.1 ppm) alone or in combination
      decreased the acute lethalities of nitrofurantoin or paraquat in vitamin
      E-adequate chicks. The results indicate that SeGSHpx-like activity in
      selenium-deficient chicks is increased by oral administration of PZ51, which
      appears to mimic the true enzyme by affording protection against clinical signs
      of selenium deficiency (i.e. ED) and pro-oxidant drug lethality.

TI  - Stimulatory effect of calmodulin antagonists on phospholipid base-exchange
      reactions in rabbit platelet membranes.
PG  - 4473-7
AB  - The properties of Ca2+-dependent incorporation of [3H]serine, [3H]ethanolamine
      and [3H]choline into the corresponding phospholipids mediated by base-exchange
      enzymes in rabbit platelet membranes were studied in the presence or absence of
      the calmodulin antagonists chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine and
      N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), all of which markedly
      activate three base-exchange reactions. The base-exchange activities were
      dependent on Ca2+ both in the presence and absence of the drugs. Other metal ions
      tested did not stimulate the base-exchange reactions, even in the presence of the
      drugs. Apparent Km values for serine, ethanolamine and choline were not affected 
      significantly by the concentration of Ca2+, with or without the drugs. [3H]Serine
      incorporation into phospholipid was competitively inhibited by ethanolamine and
      choline, [3H]choline incorporation was competitively inhibited by serine and
      ethanolamine, whereas [3H]ethanolamine incorporation was competitively inhibited 
      by serine and noncompetitively by choline. These competitive and noncompetitive
      relations between each base were also not affected by the drugs. The amount of
      45Ca2+ binding to platelet membranes was decreased by the drugs dose dependently.
      A weaker calmodulin antagonist, N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-5), 
      only slightly stimulated the base-exchange reactions, but did clearly inhibit
      45Ca2+ binding to the membranes, in the same manner as that of the other
      calmodulin antagonists used. The concentration of chlorpromazine,
      trifluoperazine, W-7 and W-5, required to produce half-maximal inhibition of Ca2+
      binding, was approximately 30 microM. These results suggest that the calmodulin
      antagonists used activate the base-exchange reactions only in the presence of
      Ca2+ without changing the affinity of each free base to base-exchange enzymes.
      The activation of the base-exchange reactions was not due to the increase in free
      Ca2+ caused by the drug-induced inhibition of Ca2+ binding to platelet membranes.

TI  - Aldose reductase in the diabetic eye. XLIII Edward Jackson memorial lecture.
PG  - 685-92
AB  - In diabetic cataracts aldose reductase initiates the cataractous process by
      converting glucose to sorbitol. The ensuing osmotic change, caused by sorbitol
      accumulation, adversely affects the lens permeability barrier so that the
      distribution within the lens of electrolytes, amino acids, and myo-inositol
      becomes grossly altered. These changes affect lens viability resulting in
      opacification. That aldose reductase triggers the process is shown by the fact
      that several structurally unrelated aldose reductase inhibitors prevent cataracts
      from occurring. Aldose reductase is also implicated in diabetic retinopathy and
      keratopathy. Aldose reductase functions in the retinal capillary pericytes, the
      cells first affected in microvascular abnormalities in diabetes. Additionally,
      retinal capillary basement membrane thickening can be prevented by aldose
      reductase inhibitors. Clinical trials are underway to determine the efficacy and 
      safety of aldose reductase inhibitors in treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - Variable regions of antibodies to synthetic polypeptides. II. Analysis of
      variable region genes encoding antibodies specific for (T,G)-A--L.
PG  - 3983-9
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies specific for the synthetic polypeptide antigen (T,G)-A--L
      have been produced in two strains of mice, C57BL/10 and C3H.SW. The genes
      encoding the variable (V) regions of these antibodies have been studied by using 
      the DNA hybridization technique of Southern, as well as by gene cloning and
      sequencing. Hybridization of DNA from 14 different cell lines with a kappa-chain 
      probe revealed that the different cell lines used one of two different gene
      rearrangements to encode the recombined V region gene. There was a perfect
      correlation between light chain rearrangement, idiotype expression, and fine
      specificity. Hybridization analyses of the heavy chain revealed a more complex
      pattern. Seven hybridomas had the rearranged heavy chain V region genes on a 4.4 
      kb EcoRI restriction fragment. Others were found on restriction fragments that
      differed in length by several hundred base pairs. The recombined heavy chain V
      region genes were cloned from three different hybridoma cell lines secreting
      anti-(T,G)-A--L antibodies, all of which express the same idiotype and fine
      specificity pattern. Restriction mapping and sequencing indicate that all three
      utilize the same V gene, identified as the 186-2 germline gene. However,
      different D and J genes are used to encode each of the antibodies. In contrast to
      the results seen in other antigen systems, heavy chain D and J genes do not have 
      a major influence on idiotype expression and fine specificity of antibodies to
      the synthetic polypeptide (T,G)-A--L.

TI  - Defective vaccine-induced resistance to Schistosoma mansoni in P strain mice.
      III. Specificity of the associated defect in cell-mediated immunity.
PG  - 3959-67
AB  - In contrast to many other strains, inbred P strain mice fail to develop
      significant levels of resistance to challenge Schistosoma mansoni infection as a 
      result of prior vaccination with radiation-attenuated cercariae. In this study,
      the relationship between defects in resistance and development of cell-mediated
      immune reactivity was examined. Although splenocytes from immunized P mice
      demonstrated deficiencies in production of macrophage-activating lymphokine(s) in
      response to either antigenic or mitogenic stimulation, other aspects of T
      lymphocyte responsiveness including blastogenesis, production of interleukin 2,
      interleukin 3 and macrophage chemotactic factor, as well as helper cell function 
      for secondary plaque-forming cell response to a T-dependent antigen and
      allospecific cytolytic T cell reactivity, appeared to be comparable with those of
      C57BL/6 mice, a strain that is protected by vaccination against S. mansoni. FACS 
      comparison revealed no significant deficits in percentages of Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, or 
      L3T4+ splenocytes in vaccinated P mice. The P-associated defect in production of 
      macrophage-activating factor appeared to be at the level of the T cell rather
      than the antigen-presenting cell, because macrophages from P mice could
      reconstitute the lymphokine-producing capacity of T-enriched splenocytes from
      immunized, resistant (C57BL/6 X P) F1 or B10.P mice, whereas the converse was not
      true. These results indicate that vaccinated P mice have a selective defect in T 
      cell function for production of macrophage-activating lymphokine, which is
      manifested as a failure to produce activated larvicidal macrophages at the site
      of specific antigen challenge in vivo and may be associated with the failure of
      this strain to become resistant to S. mansoni.

TI  - The presence of antibody in mice chronically infected with Schistosoma mansoni
      which blocks in vitro killing of schistosomula.
PG  - 3955-8
AB  - We have previously reported that IgM monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that recognize
      surface carbohydrate determinants shared between schistosomula, cercariae, and
      miracidia block antibody/complement dependent killing of schistosomula in vitro. 
      Binding assays that make use of one of the IgM mAb labeled with 125I demonstrated
      that serum from chronically infected mice (CMS) contained high levels of
      competing antibody, whereas serum from mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae 
      (VMS) contained little antibody of this specificity. Absorption of CMS with
      cercariae that removed antibodies to schistosomulum surface carbohydrate
      determinants increased its ability to kill schistosomula in vitro; absorption of 
      VMS with cercariae failed to alter the lethal activity of the serum. Furthermore,
      fractionation of CMS by protein A Sepharose chromatography demonstrated that the 
      IgG fraction had an increased lethal activity compared with unfractionated serum;
      this result was not seen with VMS. Finally, the IgM fraction of CMS was shown to 
      block in vitro killing of the IgG fractions of both CMS and VMS. These data
      suggest that the blocking activities observed with the IgM mAb are contained
      within the serum of chronically infected mice but not in the serum of mice
      vaccinated with irradiated cercariae.

PG  - 3915-20
AB  - We have examined the physiological effects of both exogenously and endogenously
      produced arachidonic acid metabolites on the expression of class II
      histocompatibility molecules in murine macrophages. This report shows that both a
      stable PGI2 analog and PGE2 are effective at suppressing lymphokine-stimulated Ia
      expression in vitro, whereas indomethacin and ibuprofen potentiate Ia expression,
      a stable TxA2 analog, TxB2, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, and LTC4 were
      ineffective on lymphokine-induced Ia expression in vitro, the suppression of Ia
      expression by PGI2 and PGE2 can be partially overcome by increasing the dose of
      lymphokine, a lymphokine supernatant capable of inducing Ia expression has no
      effect on the macrophage arachidonate enzyme activities, and the modulation of
      arachidonate metabolism during macrophage activation occurs differently in vitro 
      than in vivo.

TI  - Identification of monoclonal antibodies specific for the T cell receptor complex 
      by Fc receptor-mediated CTL lysis.
PG  - 3874-80
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed at the T cell receptor complex (TcR) on
      cloned T cells have generally been identified by their ability to inhibit the
      clone's antigen-specific function. Because such inhibition is highly dependent on
      antibody concentration and affinity, detection of anti-clonotypic antibodies to
      murine alloreactive T cells has been very difficult. In this report, an
      alternative method is described on the basis of the ability of antibodies
      specific for the TcR complex to activate T cells in an antigen-independent
      manner. The assay is based upon the observation that soluble antibodies to human 
      T3 promote lysis of irrelevant, Fc receptor-positive targets by a human CTL line.
      By using this approach, an anti-TcR mAb has been identified among a panel of
      murine mAb generated against an alloreactive CTL clone. Induction of lysis by
      soluble anti-TcR mAb has been shown to require both the expression of Fc
      receptors on the target cell and conjugate formation between the effector and the
      target cell. This assay provides a screening procedure that is much more
      sensitive than inhibition of function, and it preferentially detects antibodies
      specific for cell surface molecules involved in T cell activation.

TI  - Human interferon-gamma acts as a B cell growth factor in the anti-IgM antibody
      co-stimulatory assay but has no direct B cell differentiation activity.
PG  - 3861-7
AB  - In this study it is illustrated that recombinant human interferon-gamma
      (IFN-gamma) acts as a B cell growth factor (BCGF) in the anti-IgM antibody
      co-stimulatory assay. A monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits the
      biological activities of IFN-gamma blocks its BCGF activity supporting the
      specificity of the IFN-gamma effect. Various IFN-gamma obtained from different
      sources displayed the same BCGF activity. Nonactivated B lymphocytes do not
      proliferate in response to IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma acts directly on B cells because 
      highly purified B cells obtained after standard purification procedures coupled
      to cell sorting could still proliferate in response to IFN-gamma. Blood B
      lymphocytes were found to be more sensitive to the BCGF activity of IFN-gamma
      than B cells obtained from spleens or tonsils. The IFN-gamma-induced
      proliferation of B cells was short lasting when compared with that of recombinant
      IL 2 or BCGF containing T cell clone supernatants. B cells preactivated with
      either Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I (SAC) or optimal concentrations of
      anti-IgM antibodies coupled to beads did not proliferate in response to
      IFN-gamma, whereas they proliferated in response to IL 2 or T cell clone
      supernatants. IFN-gamma did not stimulate nor inhibit the proliferative response 
      of human B lymphocytes stimulated with optimal concentrations of anti-IgM
      antibodies or SAC. Additionally none of the different IFN-gamma tested had B cell
      differentiation factor activity in the standard SAC assay. These results indicate
      that IFN-gamma sensitizes B cells to suboptimal mitogenic concentrations of
      anti-IgM antibody.

PG  - 3836-40
AB  - Interleukin 2 (IL 2) induces specific mRNA synthesis and secretion of an
      important immunoregulatory molecule, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We have
      observed that treatment of an IL 2 independent murine T cell line, BUD-27, with
      IL 2, calcium ionophore A23187, or agents that activate
      phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C results in increased IFN-gamma mRNA 
      transcription and release of anti-viral activity. These same agents each induced 
      the subcellular redistribution of protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma
      membrane in both the BUD-27 cell line and its IL 2-dependent parent, CT6.
      Ionophore concentrations greater than 1 micron exhibited the most significant
      induction of IFN-gamma mRNA, which also correlated with the dose of ionophore,
      inducing translocation of protein kinase C. This correlation between increased
      mRNA levels and protein kinase C translocation suggests that a calcium-dependent 
      event is involved in induction of IFN-gamma mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the
      magnitude of the translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma
      membrane corresponded to the physiologic IL 2 dose-response for IFN-gamma
      secretion. The data suggest that the activation of protein kinase C and/or
      coordinate elevation of intracellular calcium may provide at least one mechanism 
      of signal transduction for the regulation of IFN-gamma gene transcription.

TI  - Small bowel mucosa from celiac patients generates 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
      (15-HETE) after in vitro challenge with gluten.
PG  - 3768-71
AB  - Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy [GSE]) is a disorder characterized
      by small intestinal mucosal injury caused by dietary exposure to wheat gluten and
      similar proteins. There is evidence that the mucosal injury is immunologically
      mediated and there is an inflammatory infiltrate present in the mucosa. It is
      postulated that release of lipid-derived inflammatory mediators may be involved
      in the pathogenesis of the mucosal injury. Jejunal mucosal biopsy samples from
      patients with GSE and from a group of patients who were subsequently shown to
      have normal jejunal mucosa were incubated with tritiated arachidonate and a
      peptic/tryptic digest of either gluten or casein. Generation of lipid-derived
      inflammatory mediators was measured by beta-scintillation counting after
      separation of metabolites by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography
      with two different buffer systems. The predominant arachidonic acid metabolite
      generated was 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). Mucosa from newly
      diagnosed GSE patients on a normal diet generated more 15-HETE than either
      control patients or GSE patients maintained on a gluten-free diet. In addition,
      gluten acted as a specific stimulus to 15-HETE production by mucosa from the GSE 
      patients on a normal diet. 15-HETE has a number of biologic effects that could
      contribute to the mucosal changes seen in GSE, and the specific release of
      15-HETE by gluten suggests involvement in the pathogenesis of the disorder.

TI  - Regulation of human T lymphocyte mitogenesis by antibodies to CD3.
PG  - 3758-67
AB  - The inhibitory and mitogenic effects of anti-CD3 antibodies (anti-CD3) were
      examined in cultures of human peripheral blood T cells. Resting T cells required 
      the presence of accessory cells (AC) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to be
      stimulated by soluble anti-CD3 (OKT3 and 64.1). Anti-CD3 was unable to induce
      activation of AC-depleted T cells as determined by IL 2 receptor expression, IL 2
      production, cell cycle analysis, or detectable DNA synthesis. Although T cell
      responses to PHA also required AC, far fewer were necessary to generate
      responses. Anti-CD3 inhibited PHA-stimulated T cell IL 2 production, IL 2
      receptor expression and proliferation in partially AC-depleted cultures.
      Moreover, anti-CD3 was able to inhibit PHA responses when added to culture as
      late as 24 to 42 hr after the initiation of a 96-hr incubation. Increasing
      concentrations of PHA reduced the inhibitory effect of anti-CD3 on PHA-stimulated
      T cell proliferation, whereas IL 2 production remained suppressed. Anti-CD3
      linked to Sepharose beads effectively inhibited PHA-stimulated T cell DNA
      synthesis, indicating that internalization of the CD3 molecule was not required
      for inhibition of PHA responses. Although inhibition of IL 2 production was a
      major effect of anti-CD3 in PHA-stimulated cultures, it was not the only apparent
      inhibitory effect because the addition of exogenous IL 2 could not prevent
      inhibition completely. Intact AC but not IL 1 also reduced anti-CD3-mediated
      inhibition of PHA responsiveness, whereas the addition of both IL 2 and AC
      largely prevented inhibition. Thus, anti-CD3 in the absence of adequate AC
      signals exerted a number of distinct inhibitory effects on mitogen-induced T cell
      activation. These results suggest that the CD3 molecular complex may play a role 
      in regulating T cell responsiveness after engagement of the T cell receptor by a 
      number of mechanisms, some of which involve inhibition of IL 2 production.

TI  - Early events in lymphocyte activation as defined by three new monoclonal
      antibodies.
PG  - 3702-8
AB  - Three new lymphocyte activation antigens are described whose kinetics of
      appearance place them very early in the activation pathway. The 78,000 dalton
      early antigen (Ea) 1 is present at low levels on resting lymphocytes, and its
      expression is enhanced twofold to threefold within 3 hr of stimulation. Ea2, a
      nondisulfide-bonded 86,000 and 73,000 dalton heterodimer, is first detectable 3
      hr after activation and peaks by 9 hr. Its presence on all but a few cell lines, 
      plus the variable association with a lower m.w. (28,000) structure, suggest that 
      it may serve as a receptor for a growth factor. Neither Ea1 nor Ea2 are
      restricted to lymphocytes. The 31,000 dalton Ea3 antigen is induced only by PHA
      but not by other means of activation, and may pre-exist within the cell. The Ea3 
      antibody blocks PHA-induced but not OKT3-induced mitogenesis, suggesting
      differences in the pathways of activation by these two stimuli. These reagents,
      and OKT3, were used to define the cyclosporine A (CSA)-sensitive stage of
      lymphocyte activation. CSA blocks at a point before the biosynthesis of Ea1 and
      after that of T3/T cell receptor loss from the cell surface, at a point close to 
      Ea2 biosynthesis.

TI  - The role of formylmethanofuran: tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase in
      methanogenesis from carbon dioxide.
PG  - 16653-9
AB  - Formylmethanofuran: tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase was purified to
      electrophoretic homogeneity from cells of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum.
      The enzyme is a tetramer of similar or identical subunits (Mr = 41,000). The
      equilibrium favors transfer of the formyl group to tetrahydromethanopterin
      (H4MPT) at physiological pH. The product of formyl transfer by the purified
      enzyme was shown by a number of criteria to be 5-formyl-H4MPT, as opposed to
      10-formyl-H4MPT or 5,10-methenyl-H4MPT. Reconstitution of a portion of the
      methanogenic C1 cycle was effected by combining purified formyltransferase,
      methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase, formylmethanofuran, and H4MPT to give
      methenyl-H4MPT. Additional reconstitution experiments established that the
      formyltransferase is an essential enzyme for the conversion of carbon dioxide to 
      methane. In conjunction with previously published data (Donnelly, M.I.,
      Escalante-Semerena, J.C., Rinehart, K. L., Jr., and Wolfe, R.S. (1985) Arch.
      Biochem. Biophys. 242, 430-439), these data substantiate the role of
      5-formyl-H4MPT as an intermediate of methanogenesis.

      core.
PG  - 16565-70
AB  - The Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase sigma 43 subunit and the phage SP82 encoded 
      28-kDa peptide are responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase to early and
      middle SP82 promoters, respectively. The delta peptide enhances the specificity
      of the interaction of B. subtilis RNA polymerase with these promoters. We have
      used sedimentation experiments to determine the effect of each of the three
      specificity factors, delta, sigma, and the 28-kDa peptide, on the binding of the 
      other two factors to RNA polymerase core and the effect of NaCl on these binding 
      equilibria. We show that sigma 43 and the 28-kDa peptide can each bind to RNA
      polymerase core at the same time as delta. Sigma 43 and the 28-kDa peptide have
      similar affinities to core at 0.1 M NaCl, but the 28-kDa peptide binds to
      core-delta more strongly than sigma 43. The implications of these findings with
      respect to the replacement of sigma 43 by the 28-kDa peptide and the mechanism of
      promoter search by B. subtilis RNA polymerase are discussed.

TI  - Sulfation of porcine parathyroid secretory protein I. Detection of tyrosine
      sulfate.
PG  - 16473-7
AB  - Secretory Protein I (SP-I) is an acidic glycoprotein that is stored and
      co-secreted with parathormone by parathyroid glands. It has been found to be
      chemically similar, if not identical, to chromogranin A of the adrenal medulla
      and to be present in most endocrine cells. In the present study, 35SO4 was shown 
      to be incorporated into SP-I and several other proteins of porcine parathyroid
      tissue incubated in vitro. The predominant sulfated species secreted to the
      medium was SP-I. Up to 20% of the tyrosine residues in secreted SP-I were labeled
      with 35SO4. Both the cellular and secreted forms migrated on sodium dodecyl
      sulfate gels as a pair of proteins with apparent molecular weights of 82,000 and 
      78,000. The 82-kDa protein could be converted to the 78-kDa species by treatment 
      with neuraminidase. Sulfate exists in SP-I as tyrosine sulfate based on the
      identification of this amino acid by thin layer electrophoresis following
      alkaline hydrolysis. Extracellular Ca2+ (3 mM) greatly suppressed the secretion
      of 35SO4-labeled SP-I without affecting the intracellular sulfation of the
      molecule or the secretion of a minor sulfated protein unrelated to SP-I. The
      ratio of incorporated 35SO4 to 3H-amino-acid was greater in secreted SP-I than in
      tissue SP-I, suggesting that much sulfation of this protein occurred during or
      just before secretion.

TI  - Lipoxin A. Stereochemistry and biosynthesis.
PG  - 16340-5
AB  - Lipoxin A (LXA) was prepared by incubation of either
      (15S)-15-hydroxy-5,8,11-cis-13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) or
      (15S)-15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11-cis-13-trans-eicosatetraenoic (15-HPETE) with human
      leukocytes stimulated by either the ionophore A23187 or the chemotactic peptide
      fMet-Leu-Phe. Comparison with four trihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids prepared by
      total synthesis showed that biologically derived LXA is
      5S,6R,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid. Three
      isomers of LXA were also identified in extracts of leukocytes utilizing an
      improved isolation procedure. These were
      (5S,6S,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (6S-LXA),
      (5S,6R,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid
      (11-trans-LXA), and
      (5S,6S,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid
      (6S-11-trans-LXA). 18O2-labeling studies indicated that formation of LXA and its 
      isomers occurred with incorporation of 18O at their C-5 but not C-6 positions.
      These results suggest that
      15-hydroxy-5,6-epoxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid or its equivalent 
      may serve as one intermediate in the biosynthesis of LXA and 6S-LXA. When added
      to guinea pig lung strips LXA provoked contractions which were slow in onset and 
      long lasting. In addition, dose response studies showed that biologically derived
      LXA and synthetic LXA were indistinguishable in this bioassay whereas synthetic
      6S-LXA and biologically derived 6S-LXA did not share this activity. Taken
      together, these results suggest that activated leukocytes utilize exogenous
      15-HETE to generate lipoxins which in turn can modulate cellular responses.

TI  - Evidence that two covalent intermediates, phosphoryl and malonyl enzymes, are
      formed during malonyl-coenzyme A synthetase catalysis.
PG  - 16295-7
AB  - The isolation of malonyl-coenzyme A synthetase from Pseudomonas fluorescens grown
      on malonate has been reported recently (Kim, Y.S., and Bang, S.K. (1985) J.
      Biol.Chem. 260, 5098-5104). This enzyme is phosphorylated in the presence of ATP 
      and Mg2+. The phosphoryl group appears on one subunit of the enzyme composed of
      two different subunits, and the phosphoryl enzyme is acid labile and base stable.
      The phosphoryl group on the enzyme is released by the incubation of the
      phosphoryl enzyme with malonate and malonyl enzyme is formed. The malonyl enzyme 
      is acid labile and also relatively unstable under basic conditions. The malonyl
      group is found on the subunit of the enzyme which is phosphorylated. Malonyl-CoA 
      is formed when malonyl enzyme reacts with coenzyme A. These results suggest that 
      two convalent intermediates, phosphoryl and malonyl enzyme, are sequentially
      formed in the synthesis of malonyl-coenzyme A by malonyl-coenzyme A synthetase
      catalysis.

TI  - Use of monoclonal antibodies to locate the chondroitin sulfate chain(s) in type
      IX collagen.
PG  - 16281-3
AB  - Recent results show that type IX collagen isolated from chicken cartilage is
      associated with one or perhaps two chondroitin sulfate chains. To locate the
      chondroitin sulfate chain(s) along the type IX collagen molecule, rotary
      shadowing was performed in the presence of monoclonal antibodies which recognize 
      stubs of chondroitin sulfate generated after chondroitinase ABC digestion.
      Monoclonal antibodies 9-A-2 and 2-B-6 which recognize stubs of chondroitin
      4-sulfate were found to bind specifically to the NC3 domain of type IX collagen, 
      and this binding was dependent on prior digestion of the preparation with
      chondroitinase ABC. Monoclonal antibody 1-B-5, which recognizes unsulfated stubs 
      of chondroitin sulfate, did not show any specific binding to type IX collagen
      either with or without chondroitinase ABC digestion. As a control, monoclonal
      antibody 2C2 was used, which in previous work was shown to bind specifically to
      an epitope located close to or at the NC2 domain. Binding of this antibody to NC2
      was unaffected by chondroitinase ABC digestion, and no specific binding of the
      antibody to the NC3 domain was detected either before or after chondroitinase ABC
      digestion.

TI  - Tyrosinase isozyme heterogeneity in differentiating B16/C3 melanoma.
PG  - 16626-35
AB  - The B16/C3 murine melanoma is a pigmented tumor that is rich in the
      copper-containing enzyme, tyrosinase. This enzyme, which converts tyrosine to
      melanin precursors, is largely associated with membrane fractions of cells and
      exists in a number of discrete isozymic forms ranging in molecular mass from
      58,000 to 150,000 daltons and pI from 3.4 to 5.2. One of these isozymes (Mr =
      58,000, pI 3.4) has been purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme catalyzes
      the hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and the
      conversion of L-DOPA to dopaquinone. Ascorbic acid, tetrahydrofolate, and
      dopamine can serve as cofactors in the hydroxylase reaction. The Michaelis
      constants for the purified enzyme were 7 X 10(-4) M for L-tyrosine and 6 X 10(-4)
      M for L-DOPA. The Vmax for L-DOPA was much greater than the Vmax for L-tyrosine
      indicating that tyrosine hydroxylation is rate-limiting in melanin precursor
      biosynthesis. Two putative copper chelators, phenylthiourea and
      diethyldithiocarbamide inhibited both the tyrosine hydroxylase and L-DOPA oxidase
      activities of the enzyme. Phenylthiourea was a noncompetitive inhibitor while
      diethyldithiocarbamide was a competitive inhibitor indicating that these agents
      act by different mechanisms. When digested with proteases and glycosidases,
      higher molecular weight forms of tyrosinase co-migrated with the purified enzyme 
      in isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis suggesting that the isozyme was derived from larger precursors.
      Thus, post-translational processing of tyrosinase may underlie isozyme diversity 
      and this may be important in the control of melanogenesis in this tumor model.

TI  - Interleukin 1 stimulates endothelial cell tissue factor production and expression
      by a prostaglandin-independent mechanism.
PG  - 256-9
AB  - Activation of coagulation occurs at inflammatory sites following the ingress of
      mononuclear cells, and may result from alterations in the vessel wall. Since the 
      monokine, interleukin 1, initiates diverse responses to inflammation, its ability
      to enhance vascular procoagulant activity was studied. Interleukin 1-treated
      cultured human endothelial cells acquired elevated levels of the procoagulant,
      tissue factor. This required de novo protein synthesis, was maximal at 2 h after 
      exposure to interleukin 1, and resulted in persistently elevated cellular
      procoagulant activity. Tissue factor was later expressed (6-24 h) on the surface 
      of uninjured endothelial cells. Endothelial cell procoagulant production and
      expression in response to interleukin 1 could be dissociated from endogenous
      prostaglandin metabolism, being insensitive to hydrocortisone, indomethacin,
      eicosatetrayionic acid and exogenous arachidonic acid. In addition, no increase
      in prostaglandin synthesis occurred during the interval in which tissue factor
      was synthesized. We therefore conclude that interleukin 1 stimulates endothelial 
      synthesis and surface expression of tissue factor by a prostaglandin-independent 
      mechanism.

TI  - Recent advances in identifying the functions of gangliosides.
PG  - 137-51
AB  - The recent development of several new approaches has proven extremely useful in
      identifying functions for gangliosides, the sialic-acid containing
      glycosphingolipids. The first is the incorporation of exogenous gangliosides into
      the plasma membrane of ganglioside-deficient cells. Using this approach, specific
      gangliosides have been identified as the receptors for certain bacterial toxins
      and viruses and as important factors in the organization of fibronectin into an
      extracellular matrix. The second approach has been a ligand blotting technique
      which allows detection of ganglioside-binding proteins such as toxins and
      antibodies. Gangliosides are separated by thin-layer chromatography and overlain 
      with the protein of interest. Specific binding of the ligand to gangliosides can 
      then be detected by either direct or indirect methods. The third approach is the 
      use of the B or binding subunit of cholera toxin as a specific probe for
      endogenous plasma membrane ganglioside function. The ability of the B subunit to 
      alter the growth of cells directly demonstrates a role for gangliosides as
      biotransducers of signals for the regulation of cell growth.

PG  - 913-6
AB  - A comparison of the cDNA-derived amino acid sequences of human stromelysin and
      collagenase with the N-terminal sequences of purified enzymes reveals that these 
      metalloproteinases are highly conserved and that they are secreted as proenzymes.
      A putative zinc-binding site was identified by its homology with the
      zinc-chelating sequence of thermolysin. These sequences permitted the
      identification of: transin, a protein induced in rat fibroblasts either exposed
      to growth factors or transformed by oncogenic viruses, as the rat homologue of
      stromelysin, and XHF1, a protein induced in human fibroblasts after treatment
      with tumourigenic agents, as collagenase.

TI  - The control of CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity in pea (Pisum 
      sativum L.).
PG  - 837-42
AB  - Several possible control mechanisms for CTP:choline-phosphate
      cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) activity in pea (Pisum sativum L.) stems were 
      investigated. Indol-3-ylacetic acid (IAA) treatment of the pea stems decreased
      total cytidylyltransferase activity but did not affect its subcellular
      distribution. Oleate (2 mM) caused some stimulation of enzyme activity by release
      of activity from the microsomal fraction into the cytosol, but neither
      phosphatidylglycerol nor monoacyl phosphatidylethanolamine had an effect on
      activity or subcellular distribution. A decrease in soluble cytidylyltransferase 
      protein concentrations was found in IAA-treated pea stems, but this was not
      sufficient to account for all of the decrease in cytidylyltransferase activity. A
      50% inhibition of enzyme activity could be obtained with 0.2 mM-CMP, which
      indicated possible allosteric regulation. Similar inhibition was obtained with
      1.5 mM-ATP, but other nucleotides had no effect. The cytidylyltransferase enzyme 
      protein was not directly phosphorylated, and the inhibition with 1.5 mM-ATP
      occurred with the purified enzyme, thus excluding an obligatory mediation via a
      modulator protein. The results indicate that the cytosolic form of
      cytidylyltransferase is the most important in pea stem tissue and that the
      decrease in cytidylyltransferase activity in IAA-treated material appears to be
      brought about by several methods.

TI  - Studies on the photolytic breakdown of hydroperoxides and peroxidized fatty acids
      by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Spin trapping of alkoxyl and
      peroxyl radicals in organic solvents.
PG  - 789-95
AB  - Spin trapping using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) has been used to
      detect and distinguish between the carbon-centred, alkoxyl, and peroxyl radicals 
      produced during the photolytic decomposition of hydroperoxides. Photolysis of
      tert-butyl and cumene hydroperoxides, and peroxidized fatty acids, in toluene,
      with low levels of u.v. light, is shown to lead to the initial production of
      alkoxyl radicals by homolysis of the oxygen-oxygen bond. Subsequent reaction of
      these radicals with excess hydroperoxide leads, by hydrogen abstraction, to the
      production of peroxyl radicals that can be detected as their corresponding
      adducts with the spin trap. Subsequent breakdown of these adducts produces
      alkoxyl radicals and a further species that is believed to be the oxidized
      spin-trap radical 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidone-2-oxyl. No evidence was obtained at 
      low hydroperoxide concentrations, with either the cumene or lipid alkoxyl
      radicals, for the occurrence of beta-scission reactions; the production of low
      levels of carbon-centred radicals is believed to be due to the alternative
      reactions of hydrogen abstraction, ring closure, and/or 1,2 hydrogen shifts.
      Analogous experiments with 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (TMPO) led
      only to the trapping of alkoxyl radicals with no evidence for peroxyl radical
      adducts, this is presumably due to a decreased rate of radical addition because
      of increased steric hindrance.

PG  - 783-7
AB  - The sequencing of human liver cDNA clones encoding the entire C1r precursor
      protein has confirmed the previously determined peptide sequence and has shown
      that there is a leader peptide which is 17 amino acids long. A residue
      tentatively identified as beta-hydroxyaspartic acid [Arlaud, Willis & Gagnon
      (1986) Biochem. J., in the press] located in the C1r A-chain, within an
      epidermal-growth-factor consensus sequence, was found to be encoded as
      asparagine. Two sequence elements, tandemly located in the A-chain, are related
      to a sequence widespread among proteins which interact with C3b or C4b.
      Structural comparisons between different clones indicate that multiple
      polyadenylation sites are responsible for the length heterogeneity observed for
      C1r mRNA from liver and Hep G2 cells.

TI  - Inhibition of gluconeogenesis by hypoglycin in the rat. Evidence for inhibition
      of glucose-6-phosphatase in vivo.
PG  - 765-9
AB  - Treatment of rats with hypoglycaemic doses of hypoglycin has been shown to
      abolish the relative detritiation of [2-3H,U-14C]glucose [Osmundsen, Billington, 
      Taylor & Sherratt (1978) Biochem. J. 170, 337-342], indicating that both the Cori
      and the glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycles were inhibited in vivo. This
      inhibition was confirmed and, in addition, it was shown that the conversion in
      vivo of both [14C]lactate and [14C]fructose into glucose was decreased after
      hypoglycin treatment. These results suggest that hypoglycin poisoning results in 
      the inhibition in vivo of glucose-6-phosphatase activity, which participates in
      the overall inhibition of gluconeogenesis and hypoglycaemia. Clofibrate feeding
      apparently protected the rats against the inhibition of the fructose-to-glucose
      conversion by hypoglycin. However, in isolated hepatocytes prepared from
      hypoglycin-treated rats, the conversion of [14C]fructose into glucose and the
      recycling of [2-3H,U-14C]glucose were not different from that in control
      hepatocytes. This suggests that the inhibition was lost during preparation of the
      hepatocytes. The direct measurement of glucose-6-phosphatase activity showed that
      it was inhibited when measured in concentrated, but not dilute, homogenates
      prepared from hypoglycin-treated rats.

      K+-dependent ATPase by measurements of [3H]ouabain binding.
PG  - 725-30
AB  - In the standard [3H]ouabain-binding assay for quantification of the Na,K-ATPase
      (Na+ + K+-dependent ATPase) concentration in rat skeletal muscles, samples are
      incubated for 2 X 60 min in 1 microM-[3H]ouabain at 37 degrees C followed by a
      wash-out for 4 X 30 min at 0 degree C. To obtain accurate determinations, values 
      determined by this standard assay should be corrected for non-specific uptake and
      retention of [3H]ouabain (11% overestimation), loss of specifically bound
      [3H]ouabain during wash-out (21% underestimation), evaporation from muscle
      samples during weighing (4% overestimation), impurity of [3H]ouabain (5%
      underestimation) and incomplete saturation of [3H]ouabain binding sites (6%
      underestimation). Thus corrected the standard [3H]ouabain-binding assay
      determines the total Na,K-ATPase concentration. Hence, in the soleus muscle of
      12-week-old rats the total [3H]ouabain-binding-site concentration is 278 +/- 20
      pmol/g wet wt. This is at variance with the evaluation of the Na,K-ATPase
      concentration from Na,K-ATPase activity measurements in muscle membrane
      fractions, where the recovery of Na,K-ATPase is only 2-18%. Quantification of the
      total Na,K-ATPase concentration is of particular importance since it is a
      prerequisite for the discussion of quantitative aspects of the Na,K-ATPase.

TI  - A cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase in Leishmania donovani.
PG  - 641-9
AB  - Leishmania donovani promastigotes labelled for 2 h with 32Pi incorporated
      radioactivity into at least 21 different proteins, as determined by
      SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Pulse-chase studies with 32Pi
      demonstrated that the labelled proteins were in a dynamic state: some
      radiolabelled proteins rapidly disappeared and others appeared after the chase.
      The possibility of an ectokinase on the parasite was examined; incubation of
      intact parasites for 10 min at 25 degrees C in an osmotically buffered medium
      containing [gamma-32P]ATP, but not [alpha-32P]ATP, resulted in the labelling of
      10 different protozoal proteins, presumably localized to the surface of the
      organism's plasma membrane. Intact promastigotes also catalysed the transfer of
      32P from [gamma-32P]ATP to histones. The histone-dependent kinase was solubilized
      by repeated freezing and thawing, and sonication, and purified 118-fold by
      chromatographing the high-speed (200,000 g, 1 h) supernatant fraction on
      QAE-Sephadex, Sephadex G-150 and hydroxyapatite columns. The kinase eluted as a
      single activity peak from all three columns. The partially purified
      histone-dependent kinase had the following properties: pH optimum, 7.0; optimum
      temperature, 37 degrees C; Km for mixed calf thymus histone, 0.15 mM; Km for ATP,
      0.8 mM; preferred fractionated histone acceptors, H2b greater than H4 greater
      than H2a greater than H3 (H1 does not serve as an acceptor); optimum activity
      required 10-20 mM-Mg2+; inhibited 50-80% by 0.01 mM- and 1 mM-Ca2+; activity was 
      not stimulated by calmodulin, cyclic AMP (1 mM) or cyclic GMP (1 mM) nor
      inhibited by a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (50
      micrograms/assay); apparent Mr 75,000, as determined by Sephadex G-150 gel
      filtration chromatography; phosphorylated exclusively serine residues. Protein
      kinase activity was low in the early exponential phase of the growth curve and
      increased 6-fold upon entry into the stationary phase.

TI  - Dynamics of superhelical DNA studied by photon correlation spectroscopy.
PG  - 191-200
AB  - We have conducted photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) studies on the plasmid
      pUC8 (2717 bp) in order to elucidate the internal dynamics of this superhelical
      DNA. We confirm that the first-order autocorrelation function of the scattered
      light from pUC8 solutions can be separated into two distinct exponential decay
      components, as first shown by Lewis et al. (R. Lewis, J.H. Huang and P. Pecora,
      Macromolecules 18 (1985) 944). A thorough analysis of the dependence on
      scattering vector K of the rates and amplitudes of the two components enables us 
      to assign the slowly relaxing part to the center-of-mass diffusion of the DNA,
      while the faster component corresponds to rotational, bending and twisting
      motions of the superhelix. For larger K values the internal motions can be
      formally expressed in terms of an 'internal diffusion coefficient' Di, whose
      value of 2.0-2.5 X 10(-11) m2 s-1 is approximately equal to the translational
      diffusion coefficient predicted for a stiff DNA piece of the persistence length, 
      65 nm. Comparison of our measured Di values to those predicted from a recent
      theory of circular worm-like coils (K. Soda, Macromolecules 17 (1984) 2365) shows
      that the internal motions are faster than the theoretical values. One of the
      reasons for this discrepancy could be that the theory does not take into account 
      torsional motions, which contribute significantly to the internal dynamics (J.C. 
      Thomas, S.A. Allison, C.J. Appelof and J.M. Schurr, Biophys. Chem. 12 (1980)
      177). At low K values, the fast relaxation of superhelical pUC8 is no longer
      proportional to K2, but reaches a constant value as K approaches zero. This
      behavior, not seen for the linearized DNA, can be interpreted in terms of
      rotational diffusion of a flexible rod-like molecule (T. Maeda and S. Fujime,
      Macromolecules 17 (1984) 2381) and supports an interwound rod-like structure for 
      pUC8 DNA with an average end-to-end distance of 220 nm.

      inhibitors].
PG  - 2217-20
AB  - Arterial hypertension shows, in the elderly, particular features and special
      problems connected with its pharmacological treatment. In our work ten patients, 
      aged between 65-75, suffering from essential hypertension, were examined for
      eight weeks. At the end of this period, we observed a significant reduction of
      systolic and diastolic pressure, heart rate being unchanged. We didn't observe
      any significant change in the metabolic parameters considered (uricemia,
      creatininemia, triglycerides and cholesterol). No patient had to interrupt the
      treatment as a consequence of side effects. According to our data, we can affirm 
      that Captopril reduces arterial pressure gradually and doesn't cause orthostatic 
      hypotension, being thus very useful in the elderly.

TI  - Chlorate--a potent inhibitor of protein sulfation in intact cells.
PG  - 870-7
AB  - Chlorate is known to be an in vitro inhibitor of ATP-sulfurylase, the first
      enzyme in the biosynthesis of PAPS which is the ubiquitous co-substrate for
      sulfation. Here, the effect of chlorate on protein sulfation in intact cells was 
      investigated. Treatment of various cell cultures with 1 mM sodium chlorate in a
      medium low in sulfate and sulfur-containing amino acids resulted in an inhibition
      of protein sulfation greater than 95%. Tyrosine as well as carbohydrate sulfation
      was blocked. Chlorate did not inhibit protein synthesis and did not exhibit any
      other toxic effects, even after prolonged treatment of cell cultures. Thus,
      chlorate treatment provides a powerful tool for studying the biological
      significance of protein sulfation.

TI  - Possible involvement of germ cells in the regulation of oestradiol-17 beta and
      ABP secretion by immature rat Sertoli cells (in vitro studies).
PG  - 861-9
AB  - The effects of germ cells prepared from adult rats and of media conditioned by
      some of these germ cells have been studied in vitro on both ABP and oestradiol-17
      beta secretion by immature rat Sertoli cells. Addition of the germ cells to the
      Sertoli cell cultures resulted in both a dose-dependent increase of ABP secretion
      and a dose-dependent inhibition of oestradiol production. These effects were
      suppressed after removal of germ cells by hypotonic treatment. Furthermore, spent
      media of highly viable germ cells (SMGC), but not spent media of an epithelial
      cell line, mimicked the effects of germ cells themselves on ABP and oestradiol
      levels after FSH or dbcAMP stimulation. These effects were reversible when SMGC
      were replaced by fresh media and did not result from a change in the conversion
      of oestradiol to oestrone. SMGC effects were unaltered by heating at 60 degrees C
      for 30 min, by freezing and thawing and non dialysable (MW greater than 10,000). 
      However, heating at 100 degrees C for 3 min and treatment by trypsin, suppressed 
      the SMGC effects. This indicates that the stimulation of ABP and inhibition of
      oestradiol levels by germ cells, in vitro, could be mediated by factor(s) of
      proteinaceous nature.

      protein kinase C.
PG  - 855-60
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor membrane receptors are rapidly down-regulated upon
      treatment of activated T lymphocytes with various activators of protein kinase C.
      Loss of binding-capacity was half maximal after 2 min. incubation in 10 ng/ml of 
      phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. A similar modulation could be induced with
      either the calcium ionophore A 23187 or the protein kinase C activator
      1-oleyl-2-acetyl glycerol, whereas 1,2-diolein and dibutyryl cAMP were
      ineffective. Protein kinase C inhibitor H7 antagonizes the phorbol ester-induced 
      TNF receptor modulation. These data suggest an important role of protein kinase C
      in the control of TNF responsiveness by regulation of TNF binding-capacity
      possibly via direct phosphorylation of specific receptor proteins.

TI  - Effect of insulin on glucagon binding to isolated rat epididymal adipocytes.
PG  - 812-7
AB  - Effect of insulin on glucagon binding to rat epididymal adipocytes was studied in
      vitro. [125I]iodoglucagon binding to isolated adipocytes was increased by
      preincubation of the cells with insulin. Maximal increase was observed with 7 X
      10(-10) M insulin. In Scatchard analysis, [125I]iodoglucagon competition data
      generated one binding site with a single affinity for glucagon binding in the
      cells pretreated with buffer alone. Pretreatment of the cells with insulin
      increased the affinity without changes in the number of binding sites.
      [125I]iodoglucagon binding to isolated adipocytes was not affected by
      pretreatment of the cells with luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,
      growth hormone, or with prolactin. These results suggest that insulin stimulates 
      glucagon binding to adipocytes.

TI  - Expression of human interleukin-2 receptor cDNA in E. coli.
PG  - 804-11
AB  - cDNAs for human interleukin-2 receptor were recently cloned and sequenced
      (Leonard et al., 1984, Nature 311, 626-631; Nikaido et al., 1984, Nature 311,
      631-635; Cosman et al., Nature 312, 768-771). In the studies reported here, we
      describe the expression of a cDNA clone for the human interleukin-2 receptor in
      E. coli using an "open reading frame" expression vector pMR100. The inserted cDNA
      was expressed in E. coli transformants as a tripartite fusion polypeptide fused
      to the lambda cI protein at its amino terminus and to beta-galactosidase at its
      carboxy terminus. We demonstrate that the bacterially produced IL-2 receptor
      protein can bind to IL-2.

TI  - Molecular cloning of the structural gene for Acinetobacter citrate synthase.
PG  - 797-803
AB  - The structural gene for citrate synthase of Acinetobacter anitratum has been
      cloned in Escherichia coli in a form which expresses the enzyme. A library of
      EcoRI fragments of Acinetobacter genomic DNA was prepared in the vector lambda
      gt10, and clones were screened by hybridization with an E. coli citrate synthase 
      clone under conditions of reduced stringency. A 6.5 kbp clone was obtained which 
      was subcloned into pBR322, and shown to direct the formation of Acinetobacter
      citrate synthase in E. coli hosts. The promoter was located within a BglII
      fragment, and from this information the orientation of the gene was deduced.

TI  - Degrading activity for human parathyroid hormone [PTH-(1-84)] in rat
      osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line UMR106.
PG  - 762-8
AB  - The degrading activity for human parathyroid hormone [hPTH-(1-84)] was studied in
      a rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line UMR106. At 37 C,UMR106 cells
      degraded hPTH-(1-84) into fragments in a time-dependent manner, which was shown
      by a radioimmunoassay with the use of antibody recognizing the C-terminal and
      middle regions of PTH molecule, whereas the degradation was completely suppressed
      at 4 C and failed to occur in the absence of the cells. The Lineweaver-Burk plot 
      of this degrading activity at 37 C showed a fairly good linearity and gave a Km
      value of 5.1 X 10(-7) M. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) analysis of immunoreactive PTH fragments in the medium disclosed two peaks
      aside from intact PTH, indicating a limited PTH-hydrolyzing activity of UMR106
      cells cleaving the molecule between at least two separate positions. This study
      suggests the possible involvement of osteoblasts on the metabolism of intact PTH.

      metabolism.
PG  - 673-81
AB  - Reversible platelet activation was studied after mechanical activation by low
      speed centrifugation (600 xg). Immediately following centrifugation platelets
      exhibited no shape change response to low doses of thrombin, collagen and ADP.
      After incubation at 37 degrees C a time-dependent recovery of the shape change
      response was observed. This was accompanied by a 50% decrease of
      32P-incorporation into phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatidylinositol-monophosphate 
      (PIP), but not PIP2, relative to levels observed immediately after
      centrifugation. After 60 minutes platelet relaxation was complete: [32]PA and
      [32]PIP reached lowest levels and the shape change response to low doses of
      thrombin was completely restored.

TI  - Stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover by concanavalin A is not sufficient 
      to activate mouse thymocytes.
PG  - 657-64
AB  - Mouse thymocytes treated with the lectin Concanavalin A do not proliferate nor do
      they develop responsiveness to interleukin 2. Co-treatment with Concanavalin A
      and either lectin-activated splenocyte conditioned medium or phorbol ester caused
      increased interleukin 2 receptor expression and proliferation. Under these
      conditions, lectin alone stimulated a 3.4 fold increase in phosphatidylinositol
      turnover which was unaffected by the presence of conditioned medium.
      Phosphorylation of a 55 kD protein was stimulated in response to conditioned
      medium or phorbol ester, but not lectin. These results indicate that stimulation 
      of phosphoinositide turnover is not sufficient to activate thymocytes, and
      suggest that costimulating factors activate a kinase which is distinct from
      protein kinase C, or alternatively, activate protein kinase C through a process
      which is not coupled to phosphoinositide turnover.

      phorbol myristic acetate.
PG  - 650-6
AB  - A combination of DIP-thrombin and either PMA (50 ng/ml) or dioctanoyl glycerol
      stimulates DNA synthesis in serum free cultures of NIL hamster cells similar to
      that previously reported for the combinatory effect of DIP-thrombin and
      gamma-thrombin. Thus, PMA or dioctanoyl glycerol appears to generate signals
      normally stimulated by gamma-thrombin interaction with cells. This stimulation
      was not observed when cells were treated with DIP-thrombin and 4-beta-phorbol or 
      4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate. Therefore, it appears that this effect is
      mediated through activation of protein kinase C and that this activation plays an
      important role in thrombin mitogenesis.

AB  - Studies of the oxygenation of linoleic acid by soybean lipoxygenase utilizing
      electron spin resonance spectroscopy and oxygen uptake have been undertaken. The 
      spin trap, alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone (4-POBN) was included in
      the lipoxygenase system to capture short-lived free radicals. Correlation of
      radical adduct formation rates with oxygen uptake studies indicated that the
      major portion of radical adduct formation occurred when the system was nearly
      anaerobic. Incubations containing [17O]oxygen with nuclear spin of 5/2 did not
      have additional ESR lines as would be expected if an oxygen-centered 4-POBN-lipid
      peroxyl radical adduct were formed indicating that the trapped radical must be
      reassigned as a carbon-centered species. To establish the presence of
      [17O2]oxygen in our incubations, a portion of the gas from the
      lipoxygenase/linoleate experiments was used to prepare the 4-POBN-superoxide
      radical adduct utilizing a superoxide producing microsomal/paraquat/NADPH system.

      2,6-bisphosphate in sucrose importing plant tissues.
PG  - 440-5
AB  - In the presence of pyrophosphate and uridine diphosphate, sucrose was cleaved to 
      form glucose 1-phosphate and fructose with soluble extracts from sucrose
      importing plant tissues. The glucose 1-phosphate then was converted through
      glycolysis to triose phosphates in a pyrophosphate-dependent pathway which was
      activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Much less activity, less than 5%, was
      found in sucrose exporting tissue extracts from the same plants. These findings
      suggest that imported sucrose is metabolized in the cytoplasm of plant tissues by
      utilizing pyrophosphate and that sucrose metabolism is partially regulated by
      fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

      leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid by human polymorphonuclear
      leukocytes stimulated by A23187. PMA alone had no effect. Enhancement of the
      response to A23187 was not seen when the inactive phorbol ester 4-alpha phorbol
      didecanoate was added with A23187. These data are consistent with the hypothesis 
      that activation of protein kinase C enhances AA release and metabolism in
      stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

TI  - The mode of reduction of vanadate(+V) to oxovanadium(+IV) by glutathione and
      cysteine.
PG  - 281-9
AB  - Vanadate(+V) is completely reduced to oxovanadium(+IV) in vitro by thiols. A high
      transient absorbance at 750 nm is observed (intense blue) in solutions of a pH
      below 5 immediately after starting the reduction. EPR-measurements and
      determinations of the consumption of free thiol groups prove that the transient
      absorbance is caused by an intermediate compound not containing vanadium in its
      reduced state (+IV). The way of reduction of vanadate(+V) by thiols is discussed.
      We propose the formation of an intermediate vanadate(+V)-thioester which is
      formed before reduction in a preequilibrium step.

TI  - Enhancing effects of angiotensin I on the vasopressin-stimulated water flow of
      toad bladder through increased cyclic AMP in mucosal cells.
PG  - 2371-5
AB  - The effects of angiotensins I and II on 10 mU/ml vasopressin-stimulated water
      flow across toad bladder were examined. Angiotensin I at concentrations of 10(-6)
      and 10(-7) M enhanced the water flow, but angiotensin II failed to do so at these
      concentrations. Angiotensin I had no effect on 5 mM cyclic AMP-stimulated water
      flow. After being preincubated for 30 min with angiotensin II, angiotensin I
      failed to have any stimulatory effect on vasopressin-stimulated water flow. At
      10(-6) M angiotensin I significantly enhanced vasopressin-stimulated cyclic AMP
      content in bladder mucosal cells. These results indicate that angiotensin I
      enhances vasopressin-stimulated water flow by increasing cyclic AMP production in
      bladder cells and that angiotensin II may possibly interfere with angiotensin I
      in a competitive manner.

TI  - Pituitary cyclic AMP and plasma hormone responses to epinephrine administration
      in vivo.
PG  - 2305-13
AB  - The present study was conducted to characterize the in vivo effects of
      epinephrine administration on levels of pituitary cyclic AMP and plasma hormones.
      Rats were injected with saline or epinephrine bitartrate (1 mg/kg lP) and
      sacrificed by decapitation 1, 5, 15, 30 or 60 min post-injection. Levels of
      pituitary cyclic AMP and plasma ACTH, beta-endorphin, beta-LPH, corticosterone
      and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassays. The injection procedure
      itself was somewhat stressful as demonstrated by increased levels of plasma
      prolactin and ACTH 5 min following either saline or epinephrine injection. This
      "stress" response was rapid and short-lasting for the pituitary hormones. The
      response of the adrenal hormone, corticosterone, to saline injection was slower
      in onset and longer in duration. Pituitary cyclic AMP levels did not increase
      following saline injection. Epinephrine-injected animals displayed markedly
      elevated plasma levels of ACTH, beta-endorphin and beta-LPH at 15, 30 and 60 min 
      as compared to control or saline-injected rats. In addition, levels of pituitary 
      cyclic AMP were increased over 10 fold at these times. Levels of plasma
      prolactin, a stress-responsive hormone, were not significantly increased in
      epinephrine-injected animals as compared to saline-injected rats indicating that 
      these later responses seem to be specific to epinephrine rather than to stress.

PG  - 1562-6
AB  - Seventeen dogs with hyperadrenocorticism were studied. Three dogs had functioning
      adrenocortical tumors and 14 had pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Each
      dog was evaluated by determining the endogenous plasma ACTH concentration and by 
      performing 4 tests: ACTH stimulation, dexamethasone screening, dexamethasone
      suppression, and a 6-hour combined dexamethasone suppression/ACTH stimulation
      test. The combined test was less reliable as a screening test in diagnosing
      hyperadrenocorticism than was the dexamethasone screening test or the ACTH
      stimulation test. Compared with the endogenous plasma ACTH concentration, results
      of the dexamethasone suppression portion of the combined test were less reliable 
      in distinguishing dogs with adrenocortical tumors from those with
      pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. It was concluded that the combined test
      cannot be recommended for use.

TI  - EBV-negative and -positive Burkitt cell lines variably express receptors for
      B-cell activation and differentiation.
PG  - 901-6
AB  - The expression of receptors for proliferation and differentiation factors was
      analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence on 29 Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines
      previously classified into 3 groups on the basis of their reactivity with 8
      monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), including anti-CALLA, BL13 and TU1. BL13 and HB5
      antibodies recognize different epitopes of the EBV/CR2 receptors. The determinant
      recognized by BL13 has been previously shown to be expressed only on cell lines
      of the first two groups, supposed to derive from the germinal center and to be
      negative on a third group of lines of putative BM origin and established from
      sporadic cases of BL. In contrast, and as expected from its reactivity on normal 
      B cells in the BM or in the lymph nodes, HB5 antibody reacts with all BL lines
      except one. The receptor for transferrin is expressed on the 29 lines. Two new
      MAbs, Bac-1 and B1H5, could recognize respectively receptors for BCGF1 and BCGF2.
      Bac-1 reacts with 15 of 17 BL lines belonging to the first two groups and 7 of 12
      BL lines of the third group; 14 of 15 EBV + lines express Bac-1. No BL line
      expresses B1H5. The IL2 receptor is weakly expressed on 5 EBV + cell lines and
      one EBV (-) line. All delta are BCGF1-positive. The almost constant expression of
      BCGF1 receptor on EBV + cell lines is the only strict relation between the
      expression of receptors for growth factors and their characteristics (i.e. EBV
      association, translocation, ethnic origin and clinical presentation). The
      maturation stage or the origin of BL cell lines in relation to the expression of 
      growth factor receptors and the functional significance of these receptors will
      be discussed.

TI  - Retinoblastoma cell differentiation in culture.
PG  - 883-7
AB  - Human retinoblastoma cells were grown in tissue culture and their differentiation
      into Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes was investigated. This process of
      photoreceptor cell differentiation was only observed in primary cultures and
      subsequent cell passages of tumors which showed these structures in vivo.
      Rosettes formed spontaneously within 5-9 d after plating of the tumor cells.
      Under optimal conditions in certain tumor cell strains, up to 80% of the cultured
      cell aggregates contained one or more differentiated Flexner-Wintersteiner
      rosettes. Exposure of retinoblastoma cells to RA or dcAMP did not alter the
      number of rosettes in culture. Retinoblastoma cells within rosettes continued to 
      synthesize DNA, and mitotic figures were frequently observed in histological
      sections. Ultrastructural analysis of rosettes formed in vitro showed many of the
      characteristics described in those found in vivo including a polarized shape,
      established cell junctions (Zonula adherens), extensive accumulation of
      mitochondria and microtubules in the apical part of the cells, numerous basal
      bodies and centrioles as well as cilia typical of the mature photoreceptor cell. 
      Lamellated stacks of membranes were also found and their nature is discussed.

AB  - The addition to culture dishes of 10-50 ng/ml of the essential diterpene ester of
      Sapium sebiferum, 12-O-hexadecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (HPA), increased colony
      formation of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes co-cultured with

      T-lymphotropic virus type- I (HTLV-I) p19-positive cells. This biological potency
      was analogous to that induced by the most potent tumor promoter
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and stronger than that of
      12-O-hexadecanoyl-16-hydroxyphorbol-13-acetate (HHPA) isolated from Aleurites
      fordii.

TI  - Receptor binding, cGMP stimulation and receptor desensitization by atrial
      natriuretic peptides in cultured A10 vascular smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 347-51
AB  - Receptor characteristics for atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) were demonstrated 
      in the permanent tissue culture system of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)
      line. 125I-ANP exhibited reversible and saturable binding to A10 rat VSMC, and
      the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd was 157 pM and maximal binding
      capacity, Bmax amounted to 115 fmol/mg of protein. Binding of the 125I-ligand was
      highly specific for certain potently displacing ANP analogues with inhibition
      constants (Ki values) in the nano- or even subnanomolar concentration range.
      Pretreatment of VSMC with ANP yielded receptor desensitization to one half of the
      ANP receptor density, and supports the conclusion of receptor autoregulation by
      ANP in A10 VSMC. The receptor coupled intracellular cGMP system was stimulated,
      and thus demonstrates the application of A10 cells as a model for the study of
      ANP receptor interaction involved in vascular smooth muscle relaxation.

AB  - Human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) isolated from a T-cell variant of
      hairy cell leukemia contains gag, pol and env genes as well as a fourth gene
      termed X, which can code three major open reading frames Xa, Xb and Xc. Proteins 
      with molecular masses of 26 kDa (p26Xb) and 24 kDa (p24Xb) encoded by the Xb open
      reading frame were identified with antisera directed against synthetic peptides
      corresponding to the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequences deduced from 
      the structure of the Xb open reading frame. More than half the Xb products were
      found to be located in the nuclear fraction of HTLV-II-infected cells.

PG  - 261-4
AB  - A tetra-heme and an octa-heme cytochrome c3 from the sulfate bacterium
      Desulfovibrio gigas have been crystallized. Diffraction quality crystals of the
      tetra-heme cytochrome are obtained from solution by the addition of polyethylene 
      glycol at pH 6.5. The crystals are orthorhombic, space group P2(1)2(1)2 with unit
      cell parameters a = 42.27 A, b = 52.54 A and c = 52.83 A. The octa-heme
      cytochrome crystals develop from low ionic strength solutions of phosphate or
      Tris-Cl in the pH range 6.2-7.6. The crystals belong to the trigonal system,
      space group P3(1) or the enantiomorph P3(2), with unit cell parameters a = b =
      57.4 A, c = 97.3 A, gamma = 120 degrees. Single crystal diffraction studies of
      the structures of these two low-potential cytochromes are in progress.

TI  - Polyethylene glycol-stimulated microsomal GTP hydrolysis. Relationship to
      GTP-mediated Ca2+ release.
PG  - 243-8
AB  - It has recently been observed that GTP mediates Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+
      stores. In contrast to effects on permeabilized cells, GTP-dependent Ca2+ release
      in isolated microsomes requires the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). We
      have investigated the effects of PEG on microsomal GTPase activity and report
      that PEG stimulates a high-affinity (Km = 0.9 microM) GTPase. The effects of PEG 
      reflect an increase in the Vmax of this activity; no effects on Km were observed.
      The concentration dependence for PEG-dependent stimulation of the high-affinity
      GTPase exactly mimicked that for GTP-dependent Ca2+ release. The stimulation of
      GTP hydrolysis by PEG was specific for the microsome fraction; only small effects
      were obtained with plasma membrane or cytosol fractions. As observed for
      GTP-dependent Ca2+ release, the microsomal PEG-stimulated GTPase was
      competitively inhibited by the GTP analog GTP gamma S (Ki = 60 nM). It is
      proposed that the PEG-stimulated GTPase may represent an intrinsic activity of
      the guanine nucleotide binding protein involved in the regulation of reticular
      Ca2+ fluxes.

TI  - Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1: reactive center and amino-terminal
      heterogeneity determined by protein and cDNA sequencing.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - Both the urokinase-type and tissue-type plasminogen activator can convert their
      approximately 54 kDa type-1 inhibitor (PAI-1) to an inactive form with a lower
      apparent molecular mass. We have determined the amino-terminal amino acid
      sequences of human native and converted PAI-1, and isolated PAI-1 cDNA and
      determined the nucleotide sequence in regions corresponding to the amino-terminus
      and the cleavage site. The data show that the conversion of the inhibitor
      consists of cleavage of an Arg-Met bond 33 residues from the carboxy-terminus,
      thus localizing the reactive center of the inhibitor to that position. In
      addition, a heterogeneity was found at the amino-terminus, with a
      Ser-Ala-Val-His-His form and a two-residue shorter form (Val-His-His-) occurring 
      in approximately equal quantities.

TI  - The second pX product p27 chi-III of HTLV-1 is required for gag gene expression.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - The human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) contains a unique pX region,
      which encodes the gene products p40 chi, p27 chi-III and p21 chi-III. p40 chi is 
      required for transcriptional trans-activation, whereas p27 chi-III and p21
      chi-III have no such function. Transfection of pX expression plasmids containing 
      different combinations for the three gene products into cells integrated with
      HTLV-1 proviruses defective in pX expression revealed that both p40 chi and p27
      chi-III are required for expression of the gag protein and accumulation of gag
      mRNA. These observations suggest that the pX product p40 chi activates
      transcription and p27 chi-III controls the level of gag mRNA by
      post-transcriptional modulation.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the basal site of hormone-sensitive lipase by glycogen

PG  - 175-80
AB  - In rat adipocytes hormone-sensitive lipase is phosphorylated at two sites termed 
      'regulatory' and 'basal', in the former case by cyclic AMP-dependent protein
      kinase causing an activation of the lipase [(1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81,
      3317-3321]. Here, the basal phosphorylation site was found to be phosphorylated
      by glycogen synthase kinase-4 without any effects on lipase activity, or on the
      extent of its activation subsequent to phosphorylation of the regulatory site.
      Glycogen synthase kinase-3, casein kinase-I, and casein kinase-II did not
      phosphorylate the lipase. Phosphorylase kinase phosphorylated it to a very low
      extent at a third phosphorylation site not phosphorylated in the fat cell.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the glycogen-binding subunit of protein phosphatase-1G by
      cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase promotes translocation of the phosphatase
      from glycogen to cytosol in rabbit skeletal muscle.
PG  - 763-9
AB  - The glycogen-bound form of protein phosphatase-1 (termed protein phosphatase-1G) 
      is composed of the catalytic (C) subunit complexed to a glycogen-binding (G)
      subunit that anchors the enzyme to glycogen [Stralfors et al. (1985) Eur. J.
      Biochem. 149, 295-303]. Incubation of purified protein phosphatase-1G with
      cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase and MgATP, which leads to stoichiometric
      phosphorylation of the G-subunit [Caudwell et al. (1986) FEBS Lett. 194, 85-90], 
      was found to promote the release of the phosphatase from glycogen; similar
      observations were made using glycogen-protein particle preparations. An
      intravenous injection of adrenaline decreased protein phosphatase-1 activity
      associated with the glycogen-protein particles by 50% with a corresponding
      increase in the amount present in the cytosol. By contrast, adrenaline did not
      affect the distribution of glycogen synthase or glycogen phosphorylase which
      remained entirely bound to glycogen in these experiments. The specific release of
      protein phosphatase-1 from glycogen may facilitate its inactivation by
      inhibitor-1 in the cytosol, thereby preventing dephosphorylation of the glycogen 
      metabolising enzymes. Translocation of protein phosphatase-1 may represent a
      novel mechanism for the activation of glycogenolysis and inhibition of glycogen
      synthesis by adrenaline.

PG  - 757-61
AB  - The occurrence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was detected in Dictyostelium
      discoideum. The levels of this compound were compared with those of cyclic AMP
      and several glycolytic intermediates during the early stages of development.
      Removal of the growth medium and resuspension of the organism in the
      differentiation medium decreased the content of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to
      about 20% within 1 h, remaining low when starvation-induced development was
      followed for 8 h. The content of cyclic AMP exhibited a transient increase that
      did not correlate with the change in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. If after 1 h of
      development 2% glucose was added to the differentiation medium, fructose
      2,6-bisphosphate rapidly rose to similar levels to those found in the vegetative 
      state, while the increase in cyclic AMP was prevented. The contents of hexose
      6-phosphates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and triose phosphates changed in a way
      that was parallel to that of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and addition of sugar
      resulted in a large increase in the levels of these metabolites. The content of
      fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was not significantly modified by the addition of the
      8-bromo or dibutyryl derivatives of cyclic AMP to the differentiation medium.
      These results provide evidence that the changes in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
      levels in D. discoideum development are not related to a cyclic-AMP-dependent
      mechanism but to the availability of substrate. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was
      found to inhibit fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of this organism at
      nanomolar concentrations, while it does not affect the activity of
      phosphofructokinase in the micromolar range. The possible physiological
      implications of these phenomena are discussed.

PG  - 727-31
AB  - Quantitative analysis of nitrocellulose filter binding data by the method of
      Clore, Gronenborn and Davies [(1982) J. Mol. Biol. 155, 447-466] has been used to
      show that lambda integration protein (Int) exhibits cooperativity in binding to
      specific recognition sites within the attachment site region (lambda attP) of
      bacteriophage lambda DNA. Optimal values of the equilibrium constant obtained
      were 3.0(+/- 1.0) X 10(10) M-1 for the P' site using a model of three sites with 
      equal affinity and 1.9(+/- 0.4) X 10(10) M-1 for the P1 site on a two-site model.
      The value of the cooperativity parameter alpha is 172(+106)(-66) in all cases.
      The occurrence of a consensus recognition sequence is necessary but not
      sufficient for strong binding; cooperative interaction between Int molecules
      binding to adjacent members of an array of binding sites is also essential. The
      occurrence of binding site arrays distinguishes lambda attP very clearly from
      other DNA sequences containing single recognition sites by chance.

TI  - Analysis of the puromycin reaction. The ribosomal exclusion principle for
      AcPhe-tRNA binding re-examined.
PG  - 715-21
AB  - The standard technique for determination of the ribosomal site location of bound 
      tRNA, viz. the puromycin reaction, has been analyzed with regard to its
      applicability under tRNA saturation conditions. The criteria derived have been
      used to re-examine the exclusion principle for peptidyl-tRNA binding, which
      states that only one peptidyl-tRNA (AcPhe-tRNA) can be bound per ribosome
      although in principle two sites (A and P site) are available. The following
      results were obtained. The puromycin reaction is only appropriate for a site
      determination if the reaction conditions prevent one ribosome from performing
      more than one puromycin reaction. With an excess of AcPhe-tRNA over ribosomes,
      and in the absence of EF-G, this criterion is fulfilled at 0 degree C, where the 
      P-site-bound material reacts with puromycin (quantitative reaction after 50 h),
      while the A-site-bound material does not. In contrast, at 37 degrees C the extent
      of the puromycin reaction can exceed the binding values by 2-4-fold ('repetitive 
      reaction'). In the presence of EF-G a repetitive puromycin reaction is seen even 
      at 0 degree C, i.e. EF-G can already promote a translocation reaction at 0 degree
      C. However, the extent of translocation becomes negligibly low for short
      incubation times (up to 60 min) at 0 degree C, if only catalytic amounts of EF-G 
      are used. Using the criteria outlined above, the validity of the exclusion
      principle for Escherichia coli ribosomes was confirmed pursuing two different
      experimental strategies. Ribosomes were saturated with AcPhe-tRNA at one molecule
      per 70S ribosome, and a quantitative puromycin reaction demonstrated the
      exclusive P-site location of the AcPhe-tRNA. The same result was also found in
      the presence of viomycin, which blocks the translocation reaction. These findings
      also indicate that here nearly 100% of the ribosomes participate in AcPhe-tRNA
      binding to the P site. Precharging the P sites of 70S ribosomes with one
      Ac[14C]Phe-tRNA molecule per ribosome prevented additional Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA
      binding. In contrast, 70S particles carrying one molecule of [14C]tRNAPhe per
      ribosome were able to bind up to a further 0.64 molecule Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA per
      ribosome.

      nucleotide regulation of anion permeability.
PG  - 689-94
AB  - Treatment of brown adipose tissue mitochondria with tetranitromethane or
      N-ethylmaleimide decreases the affinity with which inhibitory nucleotide GDP
      binds to the tissue-specific uncoupling protein. Both reagents modify cysteine
      residues which are 'accessible' and 'buried' to 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic
      acid) (Nbs2). Modification of the single Nbs2-accessible residue correlates with 
      the loss of high-affinity binding sites for GDP. Tetranitromethane does not
      affect the Cl- or H+ permeability of the protein in the absence of nucleotide,
      while N-ethylmaleimide increases both by 70-80%. Bound GDP is a less effective
      inhibitor of Cl- permeability after N-ethylmaleimide or tetranitromethane
      treatment, but retains much of the ability to inhibit H+ permeation.

TI  - Characterization of the elongation factors from calf brain. 3. Properties of the 
      GTPase activity of EF-1 alpha and mode of action of kirromycin.
PG  - 655-60
AB  - The GTPase activity of purified EF-1 alpha from calf brain has been studied under
      various experimental conditions and compared with that of EF-Tu. EF-1 alpha
      displays a much higher GTPase turnover than EF-Tu in the absence of
      aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) and ribosomes (intrinsic GTPase activity); this is due
      to the higher exchange rate between bound GDP and free GTP. Also the intrinsic
      GTPase of EF-1 alpha is enhanced by increasing the concentration of monovalent
      cations, K+ being more effective than NH+4. Differently from EF-Tu, aa-tRNA is
      much more active than ribosomes in stimulating the EF-1 alpha GTPase activity.
      However, ribosomes strongly reinforce the aa-tRNA effect. In the absence of
      aa-tRNA the rate-limiting step of the GTPase turnover appears to be the
      hydrolysis of GTP, whereas in its presence the GDP/GTP exchange reaction becomes 
      rate-limiting, since addition of EF-1 beta enhances turnover GTPase activity.
      Kirromycin moderately inhibits the intrinsic GTPase of EF-1 alpha; this effect
      turns into stimulation when aa-tRNA is present. Addition of ribosomes abolishes
      any kirromycin effect. The inability of kirromycin to affect the EF-1
      alpha/guanine-nucleotide interaction in the presence of ribosomes shows that,
      differently from EF-Tu, the EF-1 alpha X GDP/GTP exchange reaction takes place on
      the ribosome.

TI  - The transmembrane arrangement of the ADP/ATP carrier as elucidated by the lysine 
      reagent pyridoxal 5-phosphate.
PG  - 611-20
AB  - The lysine reagent pyridoxal 5-phosphate was applied to the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC)
      in order to elucidate topological and functional properties of the numerous
      lysines within the primary structure. To establish appropriate labeling
      conditions, the influence of pyridoxal-P on transport and inhibitor binding to
      the AAC was examined. The ADP/ATP transport is sensitive to low concentrations of
      pyridoxal-P with a Ki = 0.4 mM. Binding of [3H]carboxyatracylate and
      [3H]bongkrekate is largely inhibited by pyridoxal-P treatment with Ki
      approximately 1 mM. [3H]Carboxyatractylate is not and [3H]bongkrekate weakly
      removed by pyridoxal-P, whereas [3H]atractylate is displaced to a large extent.
      Under optimized conditions of pyridoxal-P concentration, of pH and of time
      exposure, the AAC was exposed to [3H]pyridoxal-P in mitochondria, in
      submitochondrial particles and in the detergent-solubilized carrier. The
      [3H]pyridoxal-P-labeled AAC was isolated from mitochondria and particles. After
      citraconylation thermolysinolytic peptides were prepared. The
      pyridoxyl-lysine-containing peptides were purified and the pyridoxal-P
      incorporation to specific lysines was determined by sequencing. The pyridoxal-P
      incorporation into the AAC in various states was evaluated with regard to
      structural and functional aspects. First, by comparing pyridoxal-P incorporation 
      in mitochondria and sonic particles, the segments of the polypeptide chain
      exposed to the cytosolic and matrix side of the membrane are detected. Second,
      the additional lysine incorporation into the isolated as compared to the
      membrane-bound carrier is attributed to the protein collar facing the
      phospholipid headgroups. Third, the difference between lysine incorporation into 
      the carboxyatractylate-AAC and bongkrekate-AAC complexes reflect either
      conformational changes or lysines involved in the translocation channel through
      the protein. Fourth, the additional lysine labeled in the atractylate-carrier
      complex as compared to the carboxyatractylate-carrier complex is attributed to a 
      cationic site in the binding center. These results are incorporated into a
      transmembrane folding model of the carrier.

AB  - Exhaustive conformational studies of d(CpG)2 and d(m5CpG)2, two convenient
      targets for DNA bisintercalating drugs, have been carried out by 1H and 31P NMR
      in low salt concentration and in the presence of 30% ethanol. Unambiguous 31P
      assignments of the B for are obtained with low-power heteronuclear decoupling
      experiments, while 31P assignments in the Z form are obtained by two-dimensional 
      homonuclear chemical exchange experiments. The 31P chemical shifts and 3JH3'P
      coupling constants studied at various temperatures in methylated and
      non-methylated tetranucleotides, are interpreted as resulting from conformational
      differences between the compounds. These features are corroborated by homonuclear
      proton nuclear Overhauser effect experiments showing the steric role of the
      5-methylcytosine in the induction of an alternating B form in d(m5CpG)2.

AB  - The core structure of Citrobacter PCM 1487 lipopolysaccharide has been
      established using methylation analysis/mass spectrometry, chemical degradations
      and one- and two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz. 1H-NMR assignments

      shown below, the alternative locations of branch terminal heptose (LDHep) and
      diphosphorylethanolamine (PPEtN) residues are marked by dashed lines; dOclA
      stands for 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid. (Formula: see text). The sample of
      the core oligosaccharide showed some microheterogeneity due to a slightly
      incomplete substitution by terminal N-acetylgalactosamine and a partial splitting
      of diphosphorylethanolamine residues.

TI  - Purification and properties of guanylate kinase from bovine retinas and rod outer
      segments.
PG  - 551-6
AB  - The presence of three soluble nucleotide phosphotransferases in bovine rod outer 
      segments was demonstrated: guanylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.8), nucleoside-diphosphate 
      kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) and adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3). The enzyme guanylate
      kinase, which catalyzes the reaction GMP + ATP in equilibrium GDP + ADP, was
      purified to homogeneity from isolated bovine rod outer segments as well as from
      bovine retinas. The enzyme preparations obtained from both sources are identical 
      in their chromatographic properties, molecular mass (20-23 kDa for both native
      enzyme and dodecylsulfate-denatured polypeptide), Km values (13 microM for GMP
      and 430 microM for ATP), specific activities, and nucleotide specificities. The
      enzyme's turnover number was estimated to be 130 s-1. The minimum amount of
      enzyme found in rod outer segments is about 1 copy per 800 rhodopsin molecules.
      The role of the enzyme in the cyclic GMP cycle in rod outer segments is
      discussed.

TI  - In-vivo-modified gonococcal plasmid pJD1. A model system for analysis of
      restriction enzyme sensitivity to DNA modifications.
PG  - 519-24
AB  - The 4207-bp cryptic plasmid (pJD1) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae has 5-methylcytosine 
      bases present at several positions in the DNA sequence. Fortuitously, these
      modified bases lie in the recognition sequences of many restriction enzymes. This
      feature makes the cryptic plasmid a model system for assaying the effect of these
      modified cytosines on the activities of the following restriction endonucleases
      and their isoschizomers: R X AvaII, R X BamHI, R X BglI, R X Fnu4HI, R X HaeII, R
      X HaeIII, R X HhaI, R X HpaII, R X KpnI, R X MspI, R X NaeI, R X NarI, R X NciI, 
      R X NgoI, R X NgoII, and R X Sau96I. Of particular interest was the finding that 
      methylation of one of the external cytosines of the palindrome 5'-CCGG-3'
      prevented its cleavage by R X MspI, but not by R X HpaII as had been suggested by
      Walder et al. [J. Biol. Chem. (1983) 258, 1235-1241].

AB  - Superoxide formation of human neutrophils stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate
      13-acetate (PMA), N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, or calcium ionophore
      A23187 was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with
      1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), an inhibitor of protein
      kinase-C, but was not inhibited by N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide
      which has a less inhibitory effect on the protein kinase-C. H-7 also inhibited
      superoxide formation of PMA-activated cytoplasts, which lack nuclei and granules.
      The phosphorylation of proteins induced by PMA in the cytoplasts as well as the
      intact neutrophils was also inhibited by preincubation with H-7. Among several
      phosphoproteins affected by H-7, one protein with a molecular weight of 19,000
      (pI = 4.9) was inhibited markedly. N-(2-Guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide
      did not inhibit the phosphorylation of proteins induced by PMA. These findings
      support the possibility that the protein kinase-C is involved in the activation
      process of superoxide formation.

TI  - Effects of adenosine and adenosine analogues on glycogen metabolism in isolated
      rat hepatocytes.
PG  - 4529-36
AB  - Adenosine and adenosine analogues were incubated with isolated rat hepatocytes.
      Adenosine and 5'-deoxy-5'-chloroadenosine stimulated glucose release, glycogen
      loss, and the conversion of glycogen phosphorylase b to a. The effect was of
      short duration for adenosine, but of long duration for
      5'-deoxy-5'-chloroadenosine. The effects on glucose release and phosphorylase
      were blocked by theophylline, an R-receptor blocking agent, but not by
      nitrobenzylthioinosine or dipyridamol which are nucleoside transport inhibitors. 
      A dose-dependent rise in cyclic AMP concentration was observed in hepatocytes 1
      min after adding adenosine. It is concluded that adenosine exerts these effects
      in liver by activating adenylcyclase. Adenosine may be involved in the short-term
      regulation of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase.

TI  - Species difference in the specific receptors of platelet activating factor.
PG  - 4511-8
AB  - Relative potencies of platelet activating factor (PAF) and PAF analogs and
      several PAF receptor antagonists when inhibiting the [3H]PAF specific binding to 
      human and rabbit platelet membranes and membrane fragments of human lung tissues 
      were compared. In rabbit platelets, L-652,731 was found to be most potent in the 
      list of PAF receptor antagonists with an equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) of 
      9.83 (+/- 2.92) X 10(-9) M followed by L-653,150 greater than kadsurenone
      congruent to Ono-6240 greater than ginkgolide B greater than CV-3988 greater than
      L-651,142, whereas in human platelets the relative potencies of these PAF
      receptor antagonists were as follows: Ono-6240 greater than L-653,150 congruent
      to L-652,731 congruent to kadsurenone greater than ginkgolide B greater than
      CV-3988 greater than L-651,142. Ono-6240 was the most potent one with a Ki of
      4.86 (+/- 1.44) X 10(-8) M which was roughly two times more potent than that in
      rabbit platelets, whereas the affinity of L-652,731 was about ten times less in
      human platelets (Ki = 1.03 (+/- 0.15) X 10(-7) M) compared to that in rabbit
      platelets (Ki = 9.83 (+/- 2.92) X 10(-9) M). These variations between species
      among PAF antagonists strongly suggest that there exists a species difference at 
      or near the binding site of the receptor of platelet activating factor. The
      relative potency of these PAF receptor antagonists in human lung membranes
      differed very little from that in human platelets and was found to be Ono-6240
      greater than L-653,150 congruent to kadsurenone congruent to L-652,731 greater
      than ginkgolide B greater than CV-3988 greater than L-651,142. Even though
      C16-PAF showed slightly higher potency in human lung, and CV-3988 and Ono-6240
      showed slightly lower, the difference was too small to suggest that there is a
      difference in the PAF receptors between human platelets and human lung tissues.

      by angiotensin-converting enzyme from monkey brain.
PG  - 4499-503
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, EC 3.4.15.1)
      from monkey brain was partially purified 274-fold with 4.5% yield. The optimum pH
      of the enzyme was 8.2, and its Km was 3.3 mM, with hippuryl-His-Leu as the
      substrate in 300 mM NaCl. Its molecular weight (Mr) was estimated to be
      approximately 260,000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. On high-performance
      liquid chromatographic analysis, ACE hydrolyzed neo-kyotorphin
      Thr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Arg) with liberation of kyotorphin (Tyr-Arg), the [Met]enkephalin
      releaser. ACE also converted [Met]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 to [Met]enkephalin; then
      the enzyme slowly hydrolyzed the resulting [Met]enkephalin. The Km values of the 
      enzyme for neo-kyotorphin and [Met]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 were 0.58 and 0.30 mM
      respectively. Thus, brain ACE may have a role in the formation of kyotorphin and 
      [Met]enkephalin from their precursors but has little part in [Met]enkephalin
      degrading processes.

TI  - An antibody to dihydropyridine calcium entry blockers. A comparison with the
      calcium channel receptor in skeletal muscle.
PG  - 4479-85
AB  - Antibodies that recognize dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium entry blockers were
      elicited from rabbits. A sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for
      dihydropyridines was developed and its specificity compared to the DHP binding
      site in skeletal muscle membranes. The antibody bound [3H]nitrendipine with a
      higher affinity (KD = 0.155 nM) than did the DHP receptor of skeletal muscle (KD 
      = 1-3 mM); however, in contrast to the DHP receptor, the antibody recognized only
      those DHP drugs with meta-nitrophenyl substituents at the 4-position on the DHP
      ring. Both the antibody and receptor exhibited stereospecificity, with each site 
      recognizing the (+)-isomer of nicardipine as the more potent. This antibody
      should prove useful in our studies of some potentially irreversible DHP
      molecules.

TI  - Isolation and kinetic studies of nucleoside diphosphokinase from human platelets 
      and effects of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
PG  - 4449-55
AB  - Nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDK) of human platelets has been purified by
      chromatography on Blue Sepharose CL-6B gel (purification factor of 950) and shown
      to be free of adenylate kinase, ATPase and adenylate cyclase. The molecular
      weight was 70,000 with subunits of 17,000. The pH optimum was 8.0 Km values for
      ATP and dTDP were determined in two ways using the pyruvate kinase-lactate
      dehydrogenase coupled enzyme assay. Values of 0.38 and 0.20 mM were obtained for 
      ATP and 0.29 and 0.21 mM for dTDP. Km values for ADP (0.024 mM) and GTP (0.12 mM)
      were determined with the hexokinase-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled
      enzyme assay. These values are in agreement with those reported for NDK from
      other sources. Theophylline, which inhibits the NDK activity of intact platelets 
      and platelet membrane preparations and inhibits the ADP-induced shape change of
      platelets, was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of both the free and
      phosphorylated forms of NDK with competitive inhibition constants (Kic) of 9.3
      and 9.6 mM respectively. Papaverine, another cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor,
      which also inhibits the ADP-induced shape change of platelets, had no inhibitory 
      effect on platelet NDK. It was concluded that the inhibitory effect of
      theophylline on the activity of the purified enzyme was due to the structural
      similarity between the methylxanthine and the adenine moiety of ADP.

      proto-oncogene. In vitro stimulation by the antitumoral intercalating drug mAMSA.
PG  - 4409-13
AB  - In an attempt to get an insight into the activity of mAMSA (a DNA topoisomerase
      II-mediated drug) on the human proto-oncogene c-myc, an in vitro system
      consisting of purified calf thymus DNA topoisomerase II and a c-myc DNA inserted 
      in lambda phage was utilized. The occurrence of discrete bands, detected by
      hybridization of Southern blots with appropriate c-myc probes, indicated the
      presence of cleavage sites in the sole presence of DNA topoisomerase II. The band
      intensity increased in the presence of mAMSA, while no significant difference
      occurred in the cleavage pattern. The location of the cleavage sites along the
      c-myc locus revealed a striking correspondence with that of some DNase
      hypersensitive sites. These results indicate that DNA topoisomerase II is most
      certainly implicated in the mAMSA activity and that the drug stimulates the
      topoisomerase II cleaving activity at specific sites, which may be involved in
      the biological activity of the drug.

TI  - Beta-adrenergic receptors in guinea-pig liver plasma membranes and thermal
      lability of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites.
PG  - 4387-93
AB  - beta-Adrenergic receptors in guinea-pig liver plasma membranes were characterized
      by radioligand binding, using l-[3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA),
      l-3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) and
      dl-[3H]4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole-2- one
      hydrochloride [( 3H]CGP-12177). The binding of both [125I]CYP and [3H]CGP-12177
      to membranes exhibited high affinity (Kd = 3.5 +/- 0.2 pM for [125I]CYP and 0.75 
      +/- 0.10 nM for [3H]CGP-12177) and stereospecificity; the maximal binding sites
      were 130 +/- 15 and 137 +/- 8 fmoles/mg protein respectively. Catecholaminergic
      agonists competed for these binding sites in the order l-isoproterenol greater
      than l-epinephrine greater than l-norepinephrine, which is typical for beta
      2-adrenergic receptors. The binding data are supported by parallel experiments on
      adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamines, and on antagonism of this
      activation by beta 1- and beta 2-selective blockers. The binding of [3H]DHA was
      excessive (Bmax = 21.4 pmoles/mg protein), exhibited low affinity (Kd = 34.6 nM),
      and lacked stereospecificity. When liver membranes were incubated at 50 degrees
      for 40 min in the presence of an agonist, l-isoproterenol, the binding of [3H]DHA
      to the heat-treated membranes exhibited high affinity (Kd = 1.07 +/- 0.17 nM) and
      the Bmax was reduced to 139 +/- 22 fmoles/mg protein. In such membranes, as
      opposed to native membranes, stereospecificity was evident and catecholaminergic 
      agonists competed for the binding sites in the order typical for beta
      2-adrenergic receptors. However, agonist competition of the binding to the
      heat-treated membranes could not be modulated by guanine nucleotides, indicating 
      a loss of communication between the receptor and the guanine nucleotide
      regulatory protein.

TI  - Deglycosylated mammalian beta 2-adrenergic receptors are still able to undergo
      functional coupling to Ns.
PG  - 4375-80
AB  - Mammalian beta 2-adrenergic receptors (R) have been shown to be structurally
      heterogeneous with respect to glycosylation (Stiles et al. J. biol. Chem. 259,
      8655 (1984). They are also heterogeneous with respect to functional coupling to
      Ns. The ternary H.R.Ns complex can be frozen in the presence of the alkylating
      reagent N-ethylmaleimide. In hamster lung membranes 45% of the receptors are
      agonist/N-ethylmaleimide sensitive (i.e. coupling-prone receptors).
      beta-Receptors in both native and isoproterenol/N-ethylmaleimide pretreated
      membrane preparations are retained by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A
      and wheat germ agglutinin and are equally sensitive to neuraminidase treatment.
      This is exhibited by the increase in mobility of the 125I-iodocyanopindolol-azide
      photoaffinity labeled receptor peptide in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
      These observations suggest that there is no link between the structural and
      functional heterogeneity of the receptors. Moreover, both partial (using
      neuraminidase) and near total (using endoglycosidase F) deglycosylation of
      membrane-bound receptors does not affect the H.R.-Ns coupling capacity as
      compared to native receptors.

TI  - The released interleukin 2 receptor binds interleukin 2 efficiently.
PG  - 3841-4
AB  - The released interleukin 2 receptor (IL 2R) molecule was characterized in order
      to clarify its biochemical structure and to determine its functional capacity.
      Enzymatic digestions demonstrated that the released IL 2R, like the cell surface 
      IL 2R, is a complex glycoprotein, modified by the addition of both N- and
      O-linked carbohydrates and sialic acid residues. It has a peptide backbone that
      is approximately 10 Kd smaller than that of its membrane-associated counterpart. 
      Affinity chromatography demonstrated that released IL 2R from either an
      HTLV-I-positive T cell line (HUT-102) or PHA-activated normal peripheral
      lymphocytes binds efficiently to purified recombinant IL 2. Furthermore, the
      interaction between the growth factor and the released receptor does not appear
      to require any accessory molecules. These observations suggest a potentially
      significant role for the released IL 2R in the regulation of IL 2-dependent
      lymphocyte functions.

TI  - Mechanism of interferon action. Expression of vesicular stomatitis virus G gene
      in transfected COS cells is inhibited by interferon at the level of protein
      synthesis.
PG  - 16764-8
AB  - The effect of interferon on the expression of the vesicular stomatitis virus
      glycoprotein G gene was examined in simian COS cells transfected with the
      expression vector pSVGL containing the G gene under the control of the SV40 late 
      promoter. When COS cells were treated with interferon 24 h after transfection,
      the synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was inhibited by about 80% 
      as compared to that in untreated controls. By contrast, under the same
      conditions, neither the plasmid copy number nor the G gene mRNA levels were
      detectably affected by interferon treatment. Likewise, the synthesis of simian
      virus 40 large T-antigen was not inhibited by interferon treatment of transfected
      COS cells even though the synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was
      markedly inhibited. The residual G protein synthesized in transfected,
      interferon-treated COS cells appeared to be normally glycosylated.

TI  - The bacteriophage Mu N gene encodes the 64-kDa virion protein which is injected
      with, and circularizes, infecting Mu DNA.
PG  - 16682-8
AB  - Upon infection of Escherichia coli with bacteriophage Mu, a 64-kDa protein is
      injected into the host cell along with the phage DNA. This protein is involved in
      circularizing the infecting Mu DNA (Harshey, R. M., and Bukhari, A. I. (1983) J. 
      Mol. Biol. 167, 427-441; Puspurs, A. H., Trun, N. J., and Reeve, J. N. (1983)
      EMBO J. 2, 345-352). Its possible role in the integration of infecting Mu DNA and
      in the infection process remains to be established. To identify the source of
      this protein we have prepared antiserum to the protein purified from viral
      particles. We have shown that the antiserum is specific for the Mu N gene
      product. The antiserum has been used to immunologically screen a Mu DNA library
      cloned into an expression vector. Four clones have been shown to produce a
      protein of 64 kDa that is specifically bound by the antiserum. The only Mu gene
      common to all four clones is the N gene, as demonstrated by physical and genetic 
      mapping. We have also demonstrated by peptide mapping that the cloned N gene
      product is identical to the 64-kDa protein found complexed with the injected Mu
      DNA.

TI  - Characterization of a DNA repair domain containing the dihydrofolate reductase
      gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
PG  - 16666-72
AB  - The formation and removal of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers were measured in
      restriction fragments near and within the essential dihydrofolate reductase
      (DHFR) gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells in order to map the genomic fine
      structure of DNA repair. Dimer frequencies were determined at 0, 8, and 24 h
      after irradiating the cells with 20 J/m2 UV light (254 nm). Within 8 h, the cells
      had removed more than 40% of the dimers from sequences near the 5' end of the
      gene, somewhat fewer from the 3' end, but only 2% from the 3' flanking region and
      10% from a region upstream from the gene. The corresponding extent of repair in
      the genome as a whole is 5-10% in the 8-h period. Isoschizomeric restriction
      enzyme analysis was used to detect the level of methylation in the fragments in
      which repair was measured. We found that the only hypomethylated sites in and
      around the DHFR gene were in the fragment near its 5' end, which displayed
      maximal DNA repair efficiency. The size of the region of preferential DNA repair 
      at the DHFR locus appears to be in the range of 50-80 kilobases, and this finding
      is discussed in relation to genomic domains and the structure of mammalian
      chromatin.

TI  - Carbodiimide inactivation of Na,K-ATPase, via intramolecular cross-link
      formation, is due to inhibition of phosphorylation.
PG  - 16660-5
AB  - We have recently shown that inactivation of renal Na,K-ATPase by
      1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide occurs via an intramolecular
      cross-link formed between an activated carboxyl group and an endogenous
      nucleophile (Pedemonte, C.H., and Kaplan, J.H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261,
      3632-3639). The modified enzyme shows the same level of Rb+ binding as untreated 
      enzyme: 3.16 and 2.93 ATP-sensitive mumol of Rb+ binding/mumol of phosphoenzyme, 
      respectively. Thus, the Rb+ binding site and the transition accomplished by low
      affinity nucleotide binding which accelerates de-occlusion are not greatly
      affected by the carbodiimide inactivation. 1 mM K+ reduces the ADP binding to the
      high affinity nucleotide binding site to the same extent in normal and
      1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-treated enzyme and Na+ counteracts 
      this effect. Thus, the competition between Na+ and K+ ions for binding to the
      free enzyme are also largely unaltered by the modification. Phosphorylation from 
      ATP (microM) in the presence of Na+ and Mg2+ ions and from inorganic phosphate in
      the presence of Mg2+ ions (in the absence or presence of ouabain) is greatly
      inhibited (85%) following carbodiimide treatment. The extent of inhibition of
      phosphorylation quantitatively correlates with the residual Na,K-ATPase activity 
      (15%). Consequently, the rate of inactivation by carbodiimide is reduced when a
      greater proportion of the enzyme is in the phosphorylated form. Fluoroscein
      isothiocyanate, which inhibits the Na,K-ATPase by covalently modifying a lysine
      residue close to the high affinity binding site for ATP in the alpha-subunit does
      not bind to the carbodiimide-inactivated enzyme. Since high affinity nucleotide
      binding is only partially inhibited by the modification produced by the
      carbodiimide this suggests that the lysine residue to which fluoroscein
      isothiocyanate binds is not specifically required for competent nucleotide
      binding.

TI  - Rubella virus cDNA. Sequence and expression of E1 envelope protein.
PG  - 16616-21
AB  - A cDNA clone encoding the entire E1 envelope protein (410 amino acid residues)
      and a portion of the C-terminal end of the E2 envelope protein of the rubella
      virus has been isolated and characterized. DNA sequence analysis has revealed a
      region 20 nucleotides in length at the 3' end of the cloned cDNA which may be a
      replicase recognition site or a recognition site for encapsidation. The
      proteolytic cleavage site between the E1 and E2 proteins was localized based on
      the known amino-terminal sequence of the isolated E1 protein (Kalkkinen, N.,
      Oker-Blom, C., and Pettersson, R. F. (1984) J. Gen. Virol. 65, 1549-1557) and the
      deduced amino acid sequence. The mature E1 protein is preceded by a set of 20
      highly hydrophobic amino acid residues possessing characteristics of a signal
      peptide. This "signal peptide" is flanked on both sides by typical protease
      cleavage sites for trypsin-like enzyme and signal peptidase. The presence of a
      leader sequence in the E1 protein precursor may facilitate its translocation
      through the host cell membrane. The E1 protein of rubella virus shows no
      significant homology with alphavirus E1 envelope proteins. However, a stretch of 
      39 amino acids in the E1 protein of rubella virus (residues 262-300) was found to
      share a significant homology with the first 39 residues of bovine sperm histone. 
      The position of 4 half-cystines and 8 arginines overlaps. The E1 protein of
      rubella virus has been successfully expressed in COS cells after transfecting
      them with rubella virus cDNA in simian virus 40-derived expression vector. This
      protein is antigenically similar to the one expressed by cells infected with
      rubella virus.

TI  - In vitro mutagenesis and overexpression of the Escherichia coli trpA gene and the
      partial characterization of the resultant tryptophan synthase mutant
      alpha-subunits.
PG  - 16604-15
AB  - A mutagenesis approach was initiated in order to examine further the folding
      behavior of the alpha-subunit of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase. A
      random single base pair saturation mutagenesis procedure (Myers, R.M., Lerman,
      L.S., and Maniatis, T. (1985) Science 229, 242-247) was applied in vitro to
      subcloned fragments of the trpA gene, which codes for this polypeptide.
      Mutagenesis plasmid vectors were constructed containing three fragments of the
      trpA gene which together code for about half of the total amino acid residues of 
      the alpha-subunit. The vectors were constructed such that each strand of each
      trpA fragment could be altered. These trpA fragments were mutagenized in vitro
      (using nitrous acid, formic acid, hydrazine, and potassium permanganate), and
      several thousands of mutants have been isolated. Thirty-two mutants, contained
      within the first two trpA fragments (which encompass the first 206 base pairs of 
      the trpA gene and encode the first 63 residues of the alpha-subunit) have been
      sequenced. Of these, 20 (63%) contained single base pair alterations, 12 (37%)
      contained multiple alterations, and 17 (53%) of these base pair alterations
      resulted in single amino acid substitutions. Selected mutant trpA fragments were 
      subcloned into an overexpression vector in which the trpA gene is controlled by
      the tac promoter and is inducible by lactose. The kinetics and extent of
      induction show that after 22 h of induction, the wild-type alpha-subunit
      constituted about 30% of the total protein. A simple one-step purification
      procedure for the alpha-subunit is described in which 15 mg of alpha-subunit can 
      be obtained from 200 ml of fully induced cultures. The mutant trpA genes were
      induced for mutant alpha-subunit expression, and an initial examination of their 
      properties in crude extracts was performed. Of the 17 mutant proteins examined,
      most were overproduced to levels comparable to that for the wild-type
      alpha-subunit. An analysis of the apparent stability, beta 2-subunit-activating
      activity, and intrinsic activity of this group of mutant alpha-subunits suggests 
      that many amino acid alterations have no apparent effect; there is a variety of
      novel functional defects; and a sequence located near residues 28 through 54 may 
      be particularly critical for the normal folding of the polypeptide.

      modification. Effect of p-mercuribenzoate and organomercurial agarose gel on
      glucose-6-phosphatase of native and detergent-modified microsomes.
PG  - 16571-8

      preincubation on the interactions of an organomercurial agarose gel and
      p-mercuribenzoate with glucose-6-phosphatase of native and Triton X-114-modified 
      rat liver microsomes were carried out. The effect of p-mercuribenzoate on glucose
      6-phosphate hydrolysis is a result of two processes, a moderate membrane
      perturbation connected with release of some latency and temperature- and
      time-dependent inhibition of the catalytic activity. Short-term preincubation
      with both organic mercurials at 37 degrees C is a necessary condition for the
      entire inhibition of the enzyme activity of native as well as of Triton
      X-114-modified microsomes. A binding site of the phosphohydrolase itself is
      accessible to p-mercuribenzoate and the phenyl mercury residue of the affinity
      gel from the cytoplasmic surface even in native microsomes. Kinetic analyses
      reveal a formally competitive mechanism of inhibition using native microsomes,
      but the kinetic picture changes to a noncompetitive pattern of Lineweaver-Burk
      plots when the inhibitor-loaded microsomes are modified optimally by Triton
      X-114. This behavior can be evaluated as the first convincing evidence for
      drastic changes of the conformational status of the phosphohydrolase during the
      membrane modification process. A combined conformational flexibility-substrate
      transport model characterizing the microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase as an
      integral channel-protein embedded within the hydrophobic interior of the membrane
      is proposed.

TI  - N-glycosylation in expression and function of beta-adrenergic receptors.
PG  - 16559-64
AB  - Through the use of specific staining and the analysis of the interaction of pure 
      beta-adrenergic receptor of S49 mouse lymphoma cells with lectins immobilized to 
      insoluble matrices, we establish that this beta-adrenergic receptor is a
      glycoprotein. The effects of swainsonine (0.2 microgram/ml), an inhibitor of
      Golgi mannosidase II, as well as those of tunicamycin (0.2 microgram/ml), an
      inhibitor of N-glycosylation, on the expression and function of this integral
      membrane glycoprotein were investigated in S49 mouse lymphoma cells grown in
      culture. Preexisting receptors on the cells were inactivated by alkylation with
      the beta-adrenergic antagonist ligand
      N-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoxylpropyl)-N'-bromoacetyl-ethylenediamine. Swainsonine did 
      not alter the number of beta-receptors measured in intact cells, the Bmax, or Kd 
      of receptors measured in membranes prepared from these cells as assayed by
      [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding or their functional coupling to adenylate
      cyclase. Autoradiograms of membranes photoaffinity-labeled with
      [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol and subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide 
      gels reveal a reduction of 6,000 in the Mr of beta-receptors in membranes
      prepared from swainsonine-treated cells. This form of receptor was sensitive to
      endoglycosaminidase H, indicating its high mannose hybrid oligosaccharide nature.
      The number and affinity of beta-receptors in tunicamycin-treated S49 cells were
      normal. Whereas stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in cells or adenylate
      cyclase in membranes by prostaglandin E1 was essentially abolished by tunicamycin
      treatment, stimulation by isoproterenol was largely unaffected. The
      nonglycosylated receptor displays an Mr that is approximately 8,000-11,000
      smaller than the native receptor. Thus, N-glycosylation does not affect the
      expression (steady-state) or function of the beta-adrenergic receptor, whereas
      prostaglandin E1 receptor function is lost. The role of N-glycosylation in
      receptor function is not universal among receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase.

AB  - The effect of guanine nucleotides on platelet and calf brain cytosolic
      phospholipase C was examined in the absence of membranes or detergents in an
      assay using labeled lipid vesicles. Guanine nucleotides stimulate hydrolysis of
      [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [( 3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2) catalyzed both by 
      enzyme from human platelets and by partially purified enzyme from calf brain.
      Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) was the most potent guanine
      nucleotide with a half-maximal stimulation at 1-10 microM, followed by guanosine 
      5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate greater than GTP greater than GDP = guanosine 
      5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). Guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) was able to reverse 
      the GTP gamma S-mediated stimulation. NaF also stimulated phospholipase C
      activity, further implying a role for a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. In
      the presence of GTP gamma S, the enzyme cleaved PtdIns-4,5-P2 at higher pH
      values, and the need for calcium ions was reduced 100-fold. The stimulation of
      PtdIns-4,5-P2 hydrolysis by GTP gamma S ranged from 2 to 25-fold under various
      conditions, whereas hydrolysis of [3H]phosphatidylinositol was only slightly
      affected by guanine nucleotides. We propose that a soluble guanine
      nucleotide-dependent protein activates phospholipase C to hydrolyze its initial
      substrate in the sequence of phosphoinositide-derived messenger generation.

      pseudo-halide ion binding to chloroperoxidase.
PG  - 16528-34
AB  - The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of several
      chloroperoxidase-inhibitor complexes have been investigated. Titrations of
      chloroperoxidase with azide, thiocyanate, cyanate, or nitrite ions indicate that 
      only the chloroperoxidase-thiocyanate complex exhibits slow ligand exchange on
      the 360-MHz NMR time scale. The temperature dependence of the proton NMR spectra 
      of the complexes suggests that, although the complexes are predominantly low-spin
      ferric heme iron, a spin equilibrium is present presumably between S = 1/2 and S 
      = 5/2 states. The pH dependence of the proton NMR spectra of the
      psuedo-halide-chloroperoxidase complexes was examined at 360 and 90 MHz.
      Chloroperoxidase complexes with azide and cyanate show similar behavior; 360-MHz 
      proton spectra are readily observed at low pH (less than 5.0) but not at high pH.
      At high pH, the ligand exchange rate falls in an intermediate time range. When
      the complexes are examined at 90 MHz, however, spectra consisting of averaged
      signals are observed. The chloroperoxidase-thiocyanate complex does not form at
      high pH values; the proton NMR spectrum observed is that of native
      chloroperoxidase. The pKa for the chloroperoxidase-thiocyanate heme-linked
      ionizable amino acid residue falls between 4.2 and 5.0. Only an averaged azide
      signal was observed in the nitrogen-15 NMR spectra for solutions that contained
      the azide complex of chloroperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and myoglobin.

TI  - Production of platelet-activating factor by chick retina.
PG  - 16502-8
AB  - In the present study it is demonstrated that platelet-activating factor (PAF) was
      produced by chick retinas, upon stimulation with neurotransmitters such as
      acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine, or with calcium ionophore A23187, but not upon
      stimulation with gamma-amino-n-butyric acid, L-glycine, L-glutamate, epinephrine,
      or histamine. PAF produced in response to ACh, dopamine, or A23187 was not
      released into supernatants but was extractable from retinas. The amounts of
      extractable PAF increased after sonication of stimulated retinas. While no PAF
      activity could be recovered from unstimulated retinas, small amounts of this
      lipid can be detected following sonication of the tissue. The amount of
      extractable PAF from ACh-, dopamine-, or A23187-stimulated retinas was dependent 
      upon the incubation time and concentration of the agonists. PAF was identified on
      the basis of chemical and lipase treatments, biological activity with washed
      rabbit platelets, behavior on thin layer chromatography, and high pressure liquid
      chromatography. Control cell preparations (leukocytes, erythrocytes, and
      embryogenic fibroblasts) did not produce PAF upon neurotransmitter stimulation.
      ACh and dopamine promoted PAF production by increasing dithiothreitol-insensitive
      cholinephosphotransferase activity, without affecting the acetyltransferase
      activity. In contrast, the A23187 ionophore stimulated the acetyltransferase
      activity but did not affect the dithiothreitol-insensitive
      cholinephosphotransferase.

TI  - Endothelial cell leukotriene C4 synthesis results from intercellular transfer of 
      leukotriene A4 synthesized by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
PG  - 16466-72
AB  - Leukotriene (LT) synthesis and metabolism were studied in porcine aortic
      endothelial cells. Leukotrienes were identified by combinations of guinea pig
      lung parenchymal strip bioassay, radioimmunoassay, and UV spectrophotometry with 
      high performance liquid chromatography. Endothelial cells stimulated with the
      calcium ionophore, A23187, were unable to convert arachidonic acid to detectable 
      levels of LTA4-derived products including the biologically active metabolites,
      LTB4 or LTC4. However, these cells readily converted exogenous LTA4 to the potent
      slow-reacting substance, LTC4. Smaller quantities of 11-trans-LTC4 and LTD4 were 
      also observed. LTB4 was not detectable in these incubations nor was LTB4
      metabolism observed. The possible intercellular transfer of LTA4 between
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) and endothelial cells was tested since PMNL
      release LTA4 when stimulated and have significant contact with endothelium. When 
      A23187-stimulated neutrophils were coincubated with endothelial cells, a
      significant increase in LTC4 levels was detected over PMNL alone. LTC4 is formed 
      by the enzymatic conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with LTA4. Therefore in some
      experiments, endothelial cells were prelabeled with [35S]cysteine to allow
      intracellular synthesis of [35S]GSH. When unlabeled PMNL were added, as a source 
      of LTA4 to the prelabeled endothelial cells, substantial levels of [35S] LTC4
      were recovered. The data indicate that endothelial cells synthesize LTC4 from
      LTA4. They also demonstrate a specific PMNL-endothelial cell interaction in which
      endothelial cell LTC4 synthesis results from the intercellular transfer of LTA4
      produced by PMNL.

PG  - 16410-3
AB  - Potential bisubstrate analogs, in which the 5'-hydroxyl group of adenosine was
      joined to the phosphoryl group acceptor by polyphosphoryl bridges of varying
      length (ApnX, where n is the number of phosphoryl groups and X is the nucleoside 
      moiety of the acceptor), were tested as inhibitors of human liver adenosine
      kinase and of thymidylate kinase from peripheral blast cells of patients with
      acute myelocytic leukemia. Adenosine kinase was most strongly inhibited by
      P1,P4-(diadenosine 5')-tetraphosphate (Kd = 30 nM) and P1,P5-(diadenosine
      5')-pentaphosphate (Kd = 73 nM). Thymidylate kinase was most strongly inhibited
      by P1-(adenosine 5')-P5-(thymidine 5')-pentaphosphate (Kd = 120 nM) and by
      P1(adenosine 5')-P6-(thymidine 5')-hexaphosphate (Kd = 43 nM). In these enzymes, 
      as in adenylate and thymidylate kinases, strongest inhibition was achieved in
      compounds containing one or two more phosphoryl groups than the substrates
      combined. These results support the view that nucleoside and nucleotide kinases
      mediate direct transfer of phosphoryl groups from ATP to acceptors, rather than
      acting by a double displacement mechanism.

PG  - 16398-403
AB  - The glucose-permease (IIGlc) of the bacterial phosphotransferase system mediates 
      sugar transport across the cytoplasmic membrane concomitant with sugar
      phosphorylation. It also functions as a receptor for bacterial chemotaxis. The
      structural gene of the permease, ptsG, has been cloned on a multicopy plasmid,
      and transformants constitutively overproducing the protein 10-15 times over
      wild-type level have been isolated. Overproduction is slightly inhibited if
      transformants are grown in a glucose-containing medium. The complete amino acid
      sequence of the glucose-permease is deduced from the nucleotide sequence. It
      consists of 477 residues and is moderately hydrophobic. A comparison of the
      glucose-permease with the mannitol-permease (Lee, C. A., and Saier, M. H., Jr.
      (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10761-10767) does not reveal any obvious homology at
      the level of amino acid sequence.

TI  - Structure-function analysis of three cAMP-independent forms of the cAMP receptor 
      protein.
PG  - 16332-9
AB  - cAMP receptor protein (CRP)-dependent operon expression in Escherichia coli
      requires the CRP X cAMP complex form of wild-type CRP. One class of crp mutants
      (crp*) activates CRP-dependent promoters in strains (cya) incapable of endogenous
      cAMP synthesis. Of fundamental interest is the difference in regulatory
      properties exhibited by crp* mutant strains, some of which exhibit
      glucose-mediated repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis, some of which do
      not. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of cAMP-independent
      promoter activation and repression we have: determined through cloning and DNA
      sequence analysis the primary structure of three CRP* forms of CRP; purified the 
      mutant proteins; characterized the effect of these mutations on CRP secondary
      structure; and studied CRP*-activated lac promoter regulation in a purified in
      vitro transcription system. The results of this study provide strong evidence
      that mutations in crp alter the conformation of CRP and result in
      cAMP-independent activation of CRP-dependent promoters in vitro. In addition, a
      CRP allele-specific inhibition of CRP* activity by spermidine was observed in
      vitro that parallels crp* strain-specific sensitivity to glucose-mediated
      repression of CRP-dependent enzyme synthesis in vivo. This observation provides
      evidence that catabolite repression in cells lacking cAMP may be mediated through
      a mechanism that inhibits CRP* activity.

TI  - A cloned bovine cDNA encodes an alternate form of the catalytic subunit of
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
PG  - 16288-91
AB  - While attempting to isolate a cDNA clone for the catalytic subunit of the bovine 
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase, we have isolated cDNAs which code for a protein
      slightly different than the known amino acid sequence. The alternate cDNA was
      identified by screening a bovine pituitary cDNA library using synthetic
      oligonucleotides predicted from the known amino acid sequence of the catalytic
      subunit. The cDNA which we identified, encodes a protein which is 93% identical
      to the known amino acid sequence of the bovine catalytic subunit. It seems likely
      that this cDNA represents a previously undiscovered catalytic subunit of the
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The mRNA for the alternate catalytic subunit is
      different in size from the mRNA coding for the previously known catalytic subunit
      and also has a different tissue distribution. These findings suggest that there
      are at least two different genes for the catalytic subunit. The differences in
      amino acid sequence and tissue distribution suggest the possibility of important 
      functional differences in the two enzymes.

TI  - Glucose 6-phosphate regulates Ca2+ steady state in endoplasmic reticulum of
      islets. A possible link in glucose-induced insulin secretion.
PG  - 16284-7
AB  - Glucose stimulation of islets is coupled with the rapid intracellular release of 
      myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and arachidonic acid which in turn
      mobilize Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The metabolism of glucose
      is required for insulin secretion although the link between glucose metabolism
      and the cellular events resulting in insulin release is unknown. In
      digitonin-permeabilized islets, glucose 6-phosphate (0.5-4 mM) increased
      significantly the ATP-dependent Ca2+ content of the ER at a free Ca2+
      concentration of 1 microM. At 0.2 microM free Ca2+, glucose 6-phosphate (2-10 mM)
      had a smaller effect. Glucose, phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, and fructose
      1,6-diphosphate had no effect on the ATP-dependent Ca2+ content of the ER.
      Glucose 1-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate also increased ATP-dependent Ca2+
      content of the ER, presumably due to conversion to glucose 6-phosphate by islet
      phosphoglucomutase and phosphoglucoisomerase, respectively. The glucose
      6-phosphate increase in the ATP-dependent Ca2+ content of the ER was shown to be 
      mediated by glucose 6-phosphatase localized to the ER. Both arachidonic acid (10 
      microM) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (2 microM) mobilized Ca2+ stored in the ER 
      by glucose 6-phosphate. However, IP3-induced (10 microM) Ca2+ release from the ER
      was abolished in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate (0.5-10 mM). We propose that
      glucose 6-phosphate could provide a regulatory link between glucose metabolism
      and intracellular Ca2+ regulation by augmenting Ca2+ sequestered in the ER as
      well as attenuating IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Thus, glucose 6-phosphate would
      serve as an "off" signal leading to a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ when both
      the free Ca2+ and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations have increased following
      glucose stimulus.

PG  - 2720-5
AB  - Three clinicopathologic cases with a remarkable pattern of extensive diffuse
      subependymal periventricular spread of cerebral metastases from solid systemic
      cancer are reported. Two patients had a small cell carcinoma of the lung. In the 
      third case, the histologic features of the brain metastases were consistent with 
      a neuron-specific enolase-positive, small cell anaplastic carcinoma. Involvement 
      of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent.
      Intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which
      rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present. The clinical data were
      nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension, in one patient, which was
      probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles.
      Results of the cerebrospinal fluid examination, available in two cases, were
      normal. The only diagnostic investigation was contrast-enhanced computed
      tomography scanning.

TI  - T-cell lymphoma revealed by a peripheral neuropathy. A report of two cases with
      an immunohistologic study on lymph node and nerve biopsies.
PG  - 2710-6
AB  - In two patients a peripheral neuropathy was the presenting symptom of a
      noncutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In the first patient, the neuropathy had
      a relapsing and remitting course, the symptoms improved under corticosteroid
      therapy. The second patient suffered from a relentless neuropathy. In both cases 
      the lymphoma infiltrated the peroneal nerve with an angiocentric and perivascular
      pattern resembling that observed in central nervous system lymphomas. The
      characterization of T-cell subsets in the lymph node showed cells with the
      helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype in the first case and a
      predominance of cells with the helper/inducer phenotype in the second case. In
      the nerve, lymphocytes beard the helper/inducer phenotype antigen. A typical
      paraneoplastic vasculitis of nerve showed clearly different immunologic features.

TI  - Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone. Diagnosis and treatment of 13 cases and
      review of the literature.
PG  - 2689-96
AB  - Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been
      confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and
      chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are
      related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this
      entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed.
      Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid
      features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor
      locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause
      unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in
      short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side
      effects.

      tract.
PG  - 2625-7
AB  - CA-125 levels were determined in seven patients with a mixed mesodermal tumor of 
      the ovary or endometrium. An elevated level was detected in five of six patients 
      with metastatic or recurrent disease. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and Adriamycin 
      (doxorubicin) resulted in a response in four patients, and the CA-125 level
      correlated well with the clinical status of the disease. Cisplatin/Adriamycin is 
      an active combination in mixed mesodermal tumors and CA-125 appears to be a
      useful marker for following therapy.

TI  - Long-term survival and morbidity in patients with metastatic malignant germ cell 
      tumors treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.
PG  - 2600-5
AB  - Forty-three of 79 patients treated for clinically metastatic germ cell cancer
      survived for a median of 66 months (range, 52-83). In patients without previous
      chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate was 69%, whereas only 32% of patients with 
      prior chemotherapy survived for 5 years. Limited disease, complete clinical
      response, histopathologically proven postchemotherapy tumor necrosis or complete 
      resectability of a posttreatment mature teratoma indicated a favorable prognosis 
      in patients without prior chemotherapy. Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less
      than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor 
      can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be
      resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation
      of the malignancy even after several years. Raynaud-like phenomena and/or
      gastrointestinal problems are the main long-term sequel (10%-15%) after modern
      multimodality treatment of advanced germ cell cancer (fertility-related problems 
      are not considered here). In the majority of surviving patients, the lifestyle
      seems unaffected by the previous intensive treatment, evaluated about 5 years
      after discontinuation of all therapy.

TI  - The Vancouver Lymphadenopathy-AIDS Study: 6. HIV seroconversion in a cohort of
      homosexual men.
PG  - 1355-60
AB  - In an ongoing prospective study of homosexual men conducted since November 1982
      in Vancouver, we identified 345 men who did not have antibody to human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at the time of enrolment and for whom results of
      follow-up serologic testing were available. A total of 66 cases of seroconversion
      were documented among the 345 men between November 1982 and October 1985. Methods
      of survival data analysis that take into account the varying durations of
      follow-up were used to study the epidemiologic features of seroconversion in this
      group. The probability of seroconversion during the entire observation period was
      23.1%. The seroconversion rates remained stable, at 10.5% and 10.0% during the
      last 2 years of the observation period. Cox regression analysis revealed the
      following variables to be independently associated with risk of seroconversion:
      frequent receptive anal intercourse, elevated number of male sexual partners in
      the year before enrolment, use of illicit drugs, a history of gonorrhea and age
      less than 30 years in November 1982. Multivariate analysis failed to reveal any
      role of oral sexual activity in the transmission of HIV. Oral ingestion of semen 
      was not associated with seroconversion in either univariate or multivariate
      analysis. The observation that younger men were more likely to seroconvert
      suggests that young homosexual men were less likely than older men to modify
      their sexual behaviour.

TI  - Anticoagulant effect of sulphated poly/vinyl alcohol-acrylic acid/copolymers.
PG  - 397-400
AB  - Copolymers of poly/vinyl alcohol-acrylic acid/ with various content of sulphate
      and carboxyl groups have been synthetized and tested for their in vitro effect on
      blood coagulation. The results indicate that the sulphated copolymers display an 
      inhibitory effect but there is a requirement in the charged groups of about 20%
      in the molecule to possess effective anticoagulation. The biochemical mechanism
      of their actions is complex, i.e. the inhibition of blood clotting is a
      consequence of both the accelerated inactivation rate of thrombin by
      antithrombin-III and a direct inhibitory effect on the thrombin-fibrinogen
      reaction. Moreover, additional effects may occur on other blood coagulation
      enzymes than thrombin, depending on the chemical composition of the copolymers.

TI  - The plasmin heavy chain-urokinase conjugate: a specific thrombolytic agent.
PG  - 364-70
AB  - Low molecular weight urokinase (LMW-UK) was coupled to the heavy chain of plasmin
      to make it able to bind to fibrin. The purified conjugate (PHC-UK conjugate),
      which consisted of equimolar concentrations of each starting material had a
      molecular weight of 93,600, bound tightly to fibrin-monomer-Sepharose and was not
      washed off with 1 M NaCl, but was eluted specifically with epsilon-amino caproic 
      acid. The conjugate showed higher fibrinolytic activity than HMW-UK. A control
      conjugate prepared by coupling human serum albumin to LMW-UK (HSA-UK conjugate)
      showed the same fibrinolytic activity as HMW-UK. The half-lives of these two
      conjugates in rabbits were about 3 times that of HMW-UK. In an experimental
      pulmonary embolism model in rabbits, the PHC-UK conjugate showed about 10 times
      higher thrombolytic activity than HMW-UK, while the HSA-UK conjugate showed
      similar thrombolytic activity as HMW-UK, and moreover caused severe systemic
      fibrinogen breakdown. Thus the significant increase in thrombolytic activity
      after injection of PHC-UK conjugate into rabbits may be due to its newly acquired
      fibrin binding activity, and not to increase in its half-life. It is concluded
      that the PHC-UK conjugate may be useful in treatment of thrombosis.

AB  - A simple method of purification for the extracellular D-glucosyltransferase
      (GTase) from a serotype c strain Streptococcus mutans was developed using
      chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and CM-cellulose. The GTase had a molecular
      weight of 155,000 and an isoelectric point of 7.4. The enzyme converted sucrose, 
      in the absence of dextran T-10, into a branched (1----6)-linked alpha-D-glucan
      having some alpha-(1----3)-linked D-glucosyl residues. The GTase was similar to
      GTases which have been isolated from other strains of serotype c S. mutans and
      which synthesise water-soluble glucans. In addition, the amino acid composition
      of the GTase protein was relatively similar to those of the GTases from serotype 
      g S. mutans which synthesise water-soluble and water-insoluble glucans.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of dynein ATPase from bull spermatozoa.
PG  - 863-9
AB  - Dialysis of demembranated bull spermatozoa against a low-salt buffer resulted in 
      the solubilization of the outer dynein arms and 15-25% of the total ATPase
      activity. Low-salt extracts contained three high-Mr peptides with Mr values above
      300,000. The ATPase activity was associated with two particles sedimenting at 19 
      S and 12 S. The heavier particle contained two major high-Mr peptides with Mr
      values above 300,000, one major and one minor intermediate peptides with Mr
      values of 91,000 and 140,000 respectively and lower-Mr peptides. The 12 S
      particle contained one high-Mr peptide positioned between the two heavy peptides 
      of the 19 S particle. Even though the peptide compositions of these two particles
      were different, the enzymic properties of their ATPases were similar. Both
      particles hydrolysed in the following preference order: ATP greater than CTP
      greater than UTP greater than ITP greater than GTP. ATPase activities were not
      affected by ouabain and oligomycin but were inhibited by vanadate,
      erythro-9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)]adenine and EDTA. Enzyme activities were dependent 
      on the presence of a bivalent cation with the following preference order: Mn2+
      greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Ni2+. Optimal activity was
      observed between pH 6.5 and 9.5. The Km for ATP ranged from 40 to 50 microM for
      both 19 S and 12 S ATPases. These results suggest that the 12 S and 19 S
      particles are dyneins from outer dynein arms.

      from pig stomach smooth muscle inhibits plasmalemmal (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-dependent
      ATPase activity.
PG  - 633-40
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (2B3) directed against the calmodulin-binding (Ca2+ +
      Mg2+)-dependent ATPase from pig stomach smooth muscle was prepared. This antibody
      reacts with a 130,000-Mr protein that co-migrates on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel
      electrophoresis with the calmodulin-binding (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase purified from
      smooth muscle by calmodulin affinity chromatography. The antibody causes partial 
      inhibition of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in plasma membranes from pig
      stomach smooth muscle, in pig erythrocytes and human erythrocytes. It appears to 
      be directed against a specific functionally important site of the plasmalemmal
      Ca2+-transport ATPase and acts as a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding. Binding
      of the antibody does not change the Km of the ATPase for Ca2+ and its inhibitory 
      effect is not altered by the presence of calmodulin. No inhibition of (Ca2+ +
      Mg2+)-ATPase activity or of the oxalate-stimulated Ca2+ uptake was observed in a 
      pig smooth-muscle vesicle preparation enriched in endoplasmic reticulum. These
      results confirm the existence in smooth muscle of two different types of
      Ca2+-transport ATPase: a calmodulin-binding (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase located in the
      plasma membrane and a second one confined to the endoplasmic reticulum.

PG  - 1276-80
AB  - A new method was applied to isolate a polypeptide hormone from human blood. The
      polypeptides from 1,000 1 of hemofiltrate with a molecular weight lower than 20
      kDaltons were adsorbed to 2.5 kg alginic acid, then eluted, precipitated, and
      desalted on a G-25 Sephadex column, thus obtaining a crude lyophilised plasma
      polypeptide extract. These polypeptides were further submitted to ion-exchange
      chromatography. Thereafter, two steps of HPLC were carried out to purify a
      distinct polypeptide which was the circulating form of cardiodilatin (CDD) in
      this case. The amino acid analysis, C-terminal enzymatic cleavage by
      carboxypeptidase A, and sequence analysis showed that the only form of
      circulating cardiodilatin is the 28 amino acid residue containing molecule,
      cardiodilatin-99-126 cleaved from the C-terminus of cardiodilatin-126 and
      identical with alpha-ANP (alpha atrial natriuretic polypeptide). Other bioactive 
      molecular forms of the polypeptide hormones of the cardiodilatin family were not 
      detected in the hemofiltrate. The isolation procedure was followed up by a
      bioassay using in vitro vascular smooth muscle relaxation.

TI  - Synthesis and biological properties of antiparallel and parallel dimers of
      alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide.
PG  - 665-72
AB  - To obtain antiparallel and parallel dimers of alpha-human atrial natriuretic
      peptide (alpha-hANP), two fully protected peptides I and II having the same amino
      acid sequence as alpha-hANP with different protective groups at the cysteinyl
      residues were synthesized, the former having Acm and Npys and the latter MeBzl
      and Acm. Equivalent amounts of peptides I and II were mixed and subjected to HF
      deprotection. Next, the first disulfide bond was linked between the remaining
      Npys group in I and the liberated SH group in II to form a monodisulfide dimer.
      The second disulfide bond was formed within the newly formed dimer between the
      remaining Acm groups by treatment with iodine, giving an antiparallel dimer. The 
      parallel dimer of alpha-hANP was synthesized similarly starting from the
      protected peptide II. These dimers could be clearly segregated on HPLC. The
      retention time on HPLC of the antiparallel dimer was identical with that of
      natural beta-hANP. Both dimers showed biological activities as high as one third 
      to one sixth of alpha-hANP in smooth muscle spasmolytic activity, and almost the 
      same level of natriuretic activity as alpha-hANP at a high dose (10 nmol/kg) but 
      about one fifth the activity at a low dose (1 nmol/kg). In these assay systems,
      the antiparallel dimer showed a slower onset and a tendency of longer duration
      than alpha-hANP.

TI  - Decreased content of docosahexaenoate and arachidonate in plasma phospholipids in
      Usher's syndrome.
PG  - 600-4
AB  - Docosahexaenoate and arachidonate were found to be significantly decreased in
      plasma phospholipids from Usher's syndrome patients. The fatty acid content of
      plasma triacylglycerols was not changed in these patients. Usher's syndrome, an
      autosomal recessive disorder, involves an inherited visual cell degeneration.
      Photoreceptor membranes are richly endowed with docosahexaenoate and
      arachidonate, and a metabolic defect affecting these polyunsaturated fatty acids 
      may occur. Moreover, blindness may be due, at least partially, to an alteration
      in the unsaturated phospholipids of photoreceptor membranes.

TI  - Phosphorylation of lipocortins in vitro by protein kinase C.
PG  - 547-54
AB  - Protein kinase C catalyzes the incorporation of about 1.1, 0.7 and 0.4 mole of
      phosphate per mole of Lipocortin-I (P35), Lipocortin-II (P36) and Lipocortin-85
      (P36 oligomer) respectively. The phosphorylation is specific for protein kinase C
      and is dependent on the presence of both calcium and phospholipids. While
      Lipocortin-I is phosphorylated on threonine residues, Lipocortin-II and
      Lipocortin-85 are phosphorylated on serine residues. The substoichiometric
      phosphorylation of Lipocortin-85 appears to preclude the potential regulation of 
      this protein by protein kinase C. The phosphorylation of Lipocortin-I on
      threonine residues and Lipocortin-II on serine residues suggests these proteins
      may be regulated by distinct phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the 47 KDa protein in gamma-thrombin-stimulated human
      platelets does not activate phospholipase A2: evidence against lipocortin.
PG  - 459-65
AB  - Intact human platelets were stimulated with alpha or gamma thrombin in the
      presence and absence of epinephrine and the ability of these agonists to
      stimulate aggregation, arachidonic acid release and protein phosphorylation was
      measured. Epinephrine alone had no effect on any of these events. Both alpha and 
      gamma thrombin induced platelet aggregation which was potentiated in each case by
      epinephrine. Similarly, both thrombin species were able to induce the
      phosphorylation of platelet 20 KDa and 47KDa proteins. The gamma thrombin-induced
      phosphorylation was slightly enhanced by epinephrine. In contrast, only alpha
      thrombin was capable of inducing significant arachidonic acid release and the
      small release induced by gamma thrombin was reduced by epinephrine. These results
      show that the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the 47KDa protein by protein
      kinase C does not impart the ability to activate phospholipase A2 in human
      platelets, and questions the suggestion that the 47KDa protein is lipocortin.

TI  - Efficient routing of glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes requires complex
      oligosaccharide chain formation.
PG  - 452-8
AB  - The biosynthesis and intracellular transport of the membrane-associated lysosomal
      enzyme glucocerebrosidase was studied in the monoblast cell line U937. Addition
      to the cultures of the oligosaccharide trimming inhibitors swainsonine or
      deoxymannojirimycin led to an increased intracellular activity of
      glucocerebrosidase. This was due to prevention of the lysosomal degradation of
      the enzyme. When homogenates of control cells were fractionated on Percoll
      gradients glucocerebrosidase, like beta-hexosaminidase, was distributed in two
      peaks, one at low density and one at high density. When homogenates of cells
      cultured in the presence of oligosaccharide trimming inhibitors were fractionated
      beta-hexosaminidase was still distributed in two peaks but glucocerebrosidase was
      found mainly in low density fractions also containing galactosyltransferase
      activity. It is concluded that complex type oligosaccharide chain formation is
      required for efficient routing of glucocerebrosidase to the lysosomes in U937
      cells.

TI  - Calmodulin inhibits inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ mobilization from the
      endoplasmic reticulum of islets.
PG  - 418-25
AB  - IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of islets is
      believed to be a key intracellular event in glucose-induced insulin secretion.
      Calmodulin was shown to increase ATP-dependent Ca2+ steady-state and inhibit by
      57.2% IP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization from the ER. Conversely, the calmodulin
      antagonist, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphtalene sulfonamide (W-7), induced
      Ca2+ release from the ER. The combination of W-7 (100 microM) and IP3 (10
      microM), resulted in a greater release of Ca2+ from the ER than either W-7 or IP3
      alone. W-7 was shown not to affect the structural integrity of the ER. Our
      results suggest that IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the ER is regulated by a
      calmodulin-dependent process.

PG  - 131-42
AB  - The effect of Prudhoe Bay crude oil (PBCO) and its different fractions
      [aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic (NOS)] on the bioenergetic functions of
      isolated rat liver mitochondria were studied. A DMSO extract of PBCO inhibited
      state 3 respiration (in the presence of ADP) with either succinate or
      beta-hydroxybutyrate as substrate. The ascorbate-TMPD dependent state 3
      respiration was not affected. Succinate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxybutyrate
      dehydrogenase activities were also lost in the presence of the PBCO extract
      suggesting that inhibition of state 3 respiration may be due to blockage of the
      electron transport chain. Stimulation of state 4 respiration (in the absence of
      ADP) and of the oligomycin sensitive ATPase activity by the PBCO extract was
      observed. Fractionation of PBCO indicated that the aromatic fraction was mainly
      responsible for its inhibitory effects. By comparison, the heterocyclic fraction 
      had weak inhibitory properties while the aliphatic fraction was essentially
      inactive. It is concluded that the aromatic components of PBCO inhibit
      mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation mainly through impairment
      of the mitochondrial membrane and inhibition of beta-hydroxybutyrate and
      succinate dehydrogenase supported electron transfer activities of the respiratory
      chain.

PG  - 2359-69
AB  - Exposure of rats to positive atmospheric ions for four days or longer results in 
      an increase in aversive response times (tail flick and hot-plate). While these
      effects are similar to those produced after opiate administration, they could not
      be inhibited by naloxone treatment. Prompt reversal of the positive ion analgesic
      effect, however was brought about by treatment with parachlorophenylalanine which
      lowers brain serotonin levels. The data suggest that the action of positive ions 
      on the pain inhibitory system is dependent upon an intact serotonin pathway and
      that the effects on this system are mediated via central rather than peripheral
      neural mechanisms.

AB  - The content of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-EPLIR) in the anterior 
      and neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus and the serum
      of the c57BL/6, BALB/C and DBA/2 inbred strains of mice was estimated at the
      resting state as well as 45 min after i.p. injection of either ethanol solution
      (3.0 g/kg.b.wt.) or saline. At the resting state, the neurointermediate lobe and 
      the serum of the c57BL/6 mice showed the highest content of beta-EPLIR, while no 
      statistically significant difference was noticed in the total beta-EPLIR content 
      in the anterior lobe and hypothalamus. At 45 min post-ethanol treatment the
      beta-EPLIR content was increased in the serum of all three strains of mice
      studied and was decreased in the hypothalamus of the c57BL/6 mice only. Further
      analysis of the beta-endorphin peptides using sephadex G-75 chromatography and
      reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography indicated strain differences
      in the relative proportions of the various forms of beta-endorphin in the
      anterior lobe, neurointermediate lobe and the hypothalamus. These strain specific
      differences in the content and post-translational processing of beta-endorphin
      may be involved in some of the genetically determined differences in responses to
      ethanol by these inbred strains of mice.

TI  - Point mutations of human interleukin-1 with decreased receptor binding affinity.
PG  - 295-8
AB  - Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a monocyte-derived polypeptide hormone that interacts
      with a plasma membrane receptor. We have used oligonucleotide-directed
      mutagenesis to construct mutant human IL-1 proteins. Three different point
      mutants in a unique histidine residue (position 30) exhibited varying degrees of 
      reduced IL-1 receptor binding affinity, whereas point mutants at five other
      residues behaved normally. Structural analysis of these mutant proteins by
      nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy detected no (or only minor)
      conformational changes relative to wild-type IL-1. These data suggest that the
      unique histidine residue influences the architecture of the receptor binding site
      on human IL-1.

      sulphates from HR9 cells.
PG  - 707-14
AB  - The mouse teratocarcinoma cell line HR9 was investigated for proteoheparan
      sulphate production. Four species of proteoheparan sulphate molecules were
      isolated and purified to homogeneity. The proteoheparan sulphate isolated from
      the tissue-culture medium contains four heparan sulphate side-chains of 25 kDa
      each, and its core protein has an approximate molecular mass of 50 kDa. The
      proteoheparan sulphates associated with the cells were separated into three
      individual species: cell proteoheparan sulphate I exhibits structural
      characteristics which are very similar to the proteoheparan sulphate isolated
      from the tissue culture medium; cell proteoheparan sulphates II and III contain
      one heparan sulphate chain of 25 kDa and 20 kDa, and core proteins of
      approximately 30 kDa and 25 kDa respectively. Antisera, raised against the medium
      form, react specifically with basement membranes in various tissues by
      immunofluorescence. This staining pattern was compared to the pattern observed
      with an antiserum which we have obtained to a proteoheparan sulphate species
      isolated from the plasma membrane of bovine aortic endothelial cells. The
      structural and immunological data suggest that basement membrane and plasma
      membrane proteoheparan sulphates are different biosynthetic products and are not 
      directly related to each other.

TI  - Quantification of ATP-producing and consuming processes of Ehrlich ascites tumour
      cells.
PG  - 701-5
AB  - ATP production of Ehrlich ascites tumour cells was estimated on the basis of
      their coupled respiration and lactate formation. ATP-consuming processes were
      assessed from the effects of selective inhibitors of RNA synthesis, protein
      synthesis and proteolysis, Na+/K+-ATPase on respiration. The extent of protein
      synthesis and proteolysis were also determined directly. From these values and
      those of the inhibition of respiration by selective inhibitors, a P/O ratio of
      2.2 was calculated. About 75% of the total ATP consumption could be assigned to
      specific processes. The major ATP-consuming processes of tumour cells in an
      amino-acid-enriched medium, in which they are in an approximate steady state, are
      protein synthesis with about 30% of total ATP consumption, and Na+/K+-ATPase with
      about 20%, while RNA synthesis, ATP-dependent proteolysis and Ca2+-ATPase
      contribute about 10% each. In an amino-acid-free glucose medium, protein
      synthesis is reduced to a third, with a corresponding decrease of respiration,
      whereas the rate of the other ATP-consuming processes is unchanged.

TI  - Inhibition of mast cell mediator release by 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide
      riboside.
PG  - 4415-21
AB  - Stimulated mast cells produce and release adenosine, and the release of mast cell
      mediators is potentiated by adenosine, yet very little is known regarding mast
      cell purine metabolism. Because 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICA
      riboside) has been shown to alter adenosine metabolism and accelerate the
      repletion of ATP pools in other tissues, its effects on mast cell function were
      examined. Neither simultaneous addition of A23187 and AICA riboside nor a 1-hr
      preincubation with AICA riboside altered mast cell beta-hexosaminidase release to
      an appreciable degree. However, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells cultured for
      2 or more days in the presence of 1-100 microM AICA riboside exhibited a markedly
      attenuated mediator release response to A23187 compared to control cells with or 
      without the additional presence of adenosine. IgE-mediated leukotriene C4
      generation from AICA riboside-exposed mast cells was even more profoundly
      inhibited without affecting cell viability or resting mediator content. An
      unusual ribonucleotide triphosphate previously identified in folate-depleted
      cells, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-triphosphate
      (ZTP), has been identified in AICA riboside-treated mast cells as well. Although 
      the mechanism of this global inhibition of mast cell mediator release by chronic 
      AICA riboside treatment is not clear, alterations in mast cell purine metabolism 
      may prove to be important in the treatment of allergic diseases.

      reveals that improved ATP level is paralleled by an increased respiratory control
      index and a reduced ATPase activity. It is suggested that
      2-mercaptopropionylglycine may cause increase of high energy phosphates during
      reperfusion by improving mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

TI  - The effect of levamisole on energy metabolism in Ehrlich ascites tumour cells in 
      vitro.
PG  - 4369-74
AB  - It has been found that levamisole, an anthelmintic drug, used also as an
      immunomodulator in human cancer therapy, is a strong inhibitor of tumour aerobic 
      glycolysis. In vitro, in Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT) cells and supernatants it
      diminishes glucose uptake and lactate formation. It does not, however, exert a
      similar inhibitory effect on glycolytic activity in normal liver and muscle
      supernatants. Metabolic and enzymatic studies have shown that levamisole directly
      inhibits tumour phosphofructokinase decreasing ATP, as well as
      2-phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate as further glycolytic intermediates.
      L-Cysteine used for comparison also as another inhibitor of tumour aerobic
      glycolysis, decreasing glucose uptake and lactate formation and diminishing
      pyruvate and ATP levels, differs in the accompanying increase in
      2-phosphoenolpyruvate concentration. This crossing-over in metabolite
      concentration, only seen in tumour material, points to tumour pyruvate kinase as 
      an isoenzyme sensitive to cysteine inhibition. Direct enzymatic studies have
      confirmed this suggestion. Some similarities in the influence on the metabolism
      of both compounds studied have been discussed, as well as the role of the effects
      observed in understanding the mechanisms of levamisole action (also in worms).

      cytoskeleton of human neutrophils.
PG  - 3996-4003
AB  - As measured by fluorescence microscopy and radioligand binding, C3b/C4b receptors
      (CR1) became attached to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton of human
      neutrophils when receptors were cross-linked by affinity-purified polyclonal
      F(ab')2 anti-CR1, dimeric C3b, or Fab monoclonal anti-CR1 followed by F(ab')2
      goat anti-mouse F(ab')2. CR1 on neutrophils bearing monovalent anti-CR1 was not
      attached to the cytoskeleton. In contrast, cross-linked CR1 on erythrocytes and
      cross-linked MHC Class I on neutrophils were not cytoskeleton associated. A
      possible role for filamentous actin (F-actin) in the binding of cross-linked CR1 
      to neutrophil cytoskeleton was suggested by three observations. When neutrophils 
      were differentially extracted with either Low Salt-detergent buffer or High
      Salt-detergent buffer, stained with FITC-phalloidin, and examined by fluorescent 
      flow cytometry, the residual cytoskeletons generated with the former buffer were 
      shown to contain polymerized F-actin, whereas cytoskeletons generated with the
      latter buffer were found to be depleted of F-actin. In parallel experiments, High
      Salt-detergent buffer was also found to release cross-linked CR1 from
      neutrophils. Second, depolymerization of F-actin by DNAse I released half of the 
      cytoskeletal-associated cross-linked CR1. Third, immunoadsorbed neutrophil CR1,
      but not MHC Class I or erythrocyte CR1, specifically bound soluble 125I-actin. In
      addition, Fc receptor and CR3, other phagocytic membrane proteins of neutrophils,
      specifically bound 125I-actin. These data demonstrate that CR1 cross-linked on
      neutrophils becomes associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and that
      this interaction is mediated either directly or indirectly by actin.

TI  - T cell induction of membrane IL 1 on macrophages.
PG  - 3868-73
AB  - We have studied the role of T cells in the induction of a membrane-associated
      form of interleukin 1 (mIL 1) in murine macrophages. T helper cell clones and a T
      cell hybridoma induced macrophages to express mIL 1 after an antigen-specific,
      Ia-restricted interaction. Induction of mIL 1 was proportional to antigen
      concentration and was increased in the early course of the response in
      macrophages pretreated in culture with interferon-gamma. mIL 1 activity was
      detectable 4 hr after interaction with T cells. mIL 1 induction was inhibited by 
      antibodies to either class II molecules or the T cell receptor. Two pathways of T
      cell-mediated mIL 1 induction could be defined. In the first, T cells, whose
      protein synthesizing capacity was completely eliminated by pretreatment with the 
      irreversible protein synthesis inhibitor emetine, induced levels of mIL 1
      expression indistinguishable from controls. In the second, T cells stimulated by 
      paraformaldehyde-fixed macrophages in the presence of concanavalin A or antigen
      secreted a soluble factor that induced macrophage mIL 1 expression. Thus, it
      appears that T cells may induce macrophages to express mIL 1 both by direct
      cell-cell contact mediated through binding of T cell receptor to the Ia/antigen
      complex, and through the release of a lymphokine after activation. This
      lymphokine does not appear to be IL 2, IFN-gamma, BSF-1, or CSF-1.

TI  - Deficiencies in suppressor T cell activity seen in patients with active systemic 
      lupus erythematosus are due to the dilution of normally functioning suppressor T 
      cells by nonsuppressor T cells.
PG  - 3809-13
AB  - Concanavalin A (Con A)-activated T lymphocytes from patients with active, but not
      inactive, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) failed to express normal suppressor 
      activity, regardless of the phenotype of CD4+ or CD8+. Con A-activated CD4+ or
      CD8+ T lymphocytes from the SLE patients and from normal controls were further
      separated into two populations, using the autologous erythrocyte rosette
      technique. One population very rich in cells capable of forming rosettes with
      autologous erythrocytes from the active patients showed the same degree of
      suppressor activity, as did that from normal controls; the CD4+ or CD8+
      population poor in autorosetting cells derived from Con A-activated T lymphocytes
      from both the controls and patients did not express suppressor activity.
      Moreover, when autorosetting T cells from the active patients and nonrosetting
      cells from the same patients were mixed at a normal ratio (4:6), normal
      suppressor activity could be restored. It was notable that the frequency of
      autorosette-forming cells was markedly reduced in the Con A-activated T
      lymphocytes from the active, but not inactive, SLE patients, regardless of the
      phenotype of CD4+ or CD8+. These findings indicate the presence of a normally
      functioning suppressor T cell population in patients with active SLE. It seems
      that the lack of suppressor T cell function in patients with active SLE is due to
      the dilution of a few normal suppressor T cells by large numbers of nonsuppressor
      T lymphocytes.

TI  - The role of adherent accessory cells in the generation of effector suppressor T
      cells.
PG  - 3717-25
AB  - The role of accessory cell populations in the generation of effector suppressor
      (Ts3) cells was studied. By using an in vitro culture system, it was previously
      determined that the induction of NP-specific effector suppressor activity
      requires T cells, antigen, and an anti-idiotypic B cell population. We now
      demonstrate that the generation of Ts3 cells in this system also requires
      accessory cells. The accessory population appears to play a role in the
      processing and presentation of antigen. These antigen-presenting accessory cells 
      are required early in the induction phase of Ts3 generation. These accessory
      cells can present NP coupled to immunogenic or non-immunogenic polypeptide
      carriers, including polymers of L-amino acids. However, NP coupled to polymers of
      poorly metabolized D-amino acids fail to induce suppressor T cell generation.
      Furthermore, the data demonstrate that an H-2 homology must exist between the Ts3
      precursors and the antigen-presenting cell population if suppressor activity is
      to be generated. We also characterize the differential genetic restrictions that 
      govern the induction of Ts3 cells that control suppression of either T cell or B 
      cell responses. The data suggest that although I-J region encoded gene products
      control the induction and effector phases of suppressor cell activity as measured
      on T cell responses, the suppression of B cell responses appear to be controlled 
      by I-A gene products. Possible cellular mechanisms that might explain these
      findings are discussed.

TI  - Characterization of two monoclonal idiotype-binding suppressor T cell factors
      specific for the antibody response to L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 
      (GAT).
PG  - 3709-16
AB  - We have previously identified and described two distinct types of suppressor T
      cell factors specific for the PFC response to L-glutamic
      acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT) or L-glutamic acid50-L-tyrosine50 (GT).
      Both of these factors are antigen-specific and I-J+. GAT-TsF1 is not
      MHC-restricted and is composed of a single polypeptide chain, whereas GAT-TsF2 is
      MHC-restricted and is composed of two different polypeptide chains. We have not
      previously found evidence for an obligatory, idiotype-specific suppressor T cell 
      in this suppressor pathway. However, we now report that idiotype-specific
      suppressor T cells can be elicited by exposing normal spleen cells to GAT-TsF1 or
      GAT-TsF2 in the absence of antigen in vitro. These factor (TsF1/TsF2)-induced
      cells have been fused with the AKR thymoma, BW5147, and hybridomas were selected 
      for production of suppressor factors that inhibit GAT-specific antibody responses
      in vitro. In this report, we characterize one monoclonal factor from each fusion.
      Neither factor binds GAT or the related co-polymer, GT; both factors have binding
      sites for GAT-specific idiotypes but not for unrelated idiotypes either in the
      form of antibody immobilized on Sepharose or as cell surface determinants
      expressed by B cell hybridomas. Moreover, their reactivities for a panel of
      monoclonal anti-GAT antibodies are overlapping but not identical. Both factors
      are composed of two polypeptide chains, and both chains are required for
      suppressive activity; one chain bears the I-J determinant, whereas the other
      possesses the idiotype-binding activity of the intact molecule. Both
      idiotype-binding factors are restricted by MHC- and Igh-linked genes, and
      transcomplementation is observed in the F1 mice between MHC-congenic and
      Igh-congenic parents. Both factors are active late in Mishell-Dutton cultures.
      These data support the contention that these two factors are similar but
      nonidentical members of an anti-idiotypic class of GAT-specific suppressor
      factors.

PG  - 16749-54
AB  - Troponin was isolated from striated adductor muscles of the "Akazara" scallop
      (Chlamys nipponensis akazara), and purified in an active form by DEAE-cellulose
      (Whatman DE52) column chromatography and subsequent gel filtration on Sephacryl
      S-300. According to sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and densitometry, 
      Akazara troponin is composed of three components having molecular weights of
      52,000, 40,000, and 20,000 in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. The three components were
      separated from each other by column chromatography in the presence of 6 M urea
      and 1 mM EDTA on SP-Sephadex C-50 and DEAE-cellulose. The Mr 20,000 component was
      regarded as troponin C according to the Ca2+-binding properties, which was found 
      to bind 0.7 mol of Ca2+/mol at 0.1 mM Ca2+. The association constant of Ca2+ to
      troponin C was estimated to be 5 X 10(5) M-1, and was not affected by the
      addition of 2 mM MgCl2. The Mr 52,000 component appeared to be troponin I, since 
      it inhibited, together with Akazara tropomyosin, both Mg-ATPase and
      superprecipitation activities of actomyosin reconstituted from rabbit myosin and 
      actin, and the inhibition of the ATPase activity was diminished by the addition
      of Akazara troponin C. Finally, the Mr 40,000 component appeared to be troponin
      T, since it co-precipitated with actin-tropomyosin filament and was indispensable
      with Akazara troponin C and the Mr 52,000 component (troponin I) for conferring
      the Ca2+ sensitivity to reconstituted actomyosin.

TI  - Comparison of insulin-like growth factor I receptor and insulin receptor purified
      from human placental membranes.
PG  - 16727-31
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor purified from human placental
      membranes as previously described (LeBon, T. R., Jacobs, S., Cuatrecasas, P.,
      Kathuria, S., and Fujita-Yamaguchi, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7685-7689) was 
      characterized. The IGF-I receptor was similar to the insulin receptor with
      respect to subunit structure (beta-alpha-alpha-beta), apparent sizes of
      deglycosylated alpha (Mr = approximately 88,000) and beta (Mr = approximately
      67,000) subunits, and amino acid composition of the subunits. Monoclonal antibody
      specific to each receptor recognized its own receptor whereas polyclonal
      anti-human insulin receptor antibody cross-reacted with the IGF-I receptor,
      indicating that the receptors share one or more antigenic sites. Further
      characterization of the purified IGF-I receptor tyrosine-protein kinase activity 
      indicated that by analogy with the insulin receptor the monomeric alpha beta form
      of the IGF-I receptor appears to have higher kinase activity than the intact
      receptor in the alpha 2 beta 2 form. The most significant difference between the 
      two receptors was found in the N-terminal amino acid sequences of their alpha
      subunits, which apparently show 60% identity. The IGF-I receptor alpha subunit
      lacks residues corresponding to the N-terminal 4 amino acids of the insulin
      receptor alpha subunit. These results provide the first direct proof that the
      IGF-I receptor is a molecule distinct from the insulin receptor despite numerous 
      similarities.

TI  - Partial characterization of heparan and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans
      synthesized by normal rat glomeruli.
PG  - 16636-52
AB  - Rat glomerular heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycan
      synthesis was studied in vitro and in vivo. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate into
      macromolecules was linear over 16 h in vitro, and DS was the predominant
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG), while HS dominated in vivo incubations. Proteoglycans
      were found in the bottom 2/5 (high density) CsCl gradient fractions and eluted as
      two overlapping peaks from DEAE-Sephacel columns. The proportion of low density
      35S-glycoproteins and 35S-proteoglycans increased with time. Two high buoyant
      density HS proteoglycans were extracted from glomeruli and eluted in DEAE peak I.
      The first, HS-tIA, had an Mr of 130 X 10(3) with Mr 12.5 X 10(3) GAG chains. This
      proteoglycan was released from the tissue by trypsin and was partially displaced 
      by heparin treatment. In addition, it was rapidly released into the medium of
      label-chase experiments after which it migrated slightly more rapidly than HS-tIA
      in gels, with HS chains similar in length to its tissue counterpart. The second, 
      HS-tIB, had an Mr of 8.6 X 10(3) with little or no attached protein. This
      proteoglycan was characterized as intracellular as it resisted release by trypsin
      treatment or heparin extraction in medium and was not detected in the medium of
      label-chase experiments. Two tissue DS proteoglycans were characterized. The
      first, DS-tIA, co-purified with HS-tIA and was the predominant proteoglycan
      synthesized during 4-h in vitro incubations. Like HS-tIA, it was rapidly released
      into medium and displaced from cell surfaces or tissue "receptors" by heparin or 
      trypsin treatments. A second, Sepharose CL-6B-excluded DS proteoglycan from DEAE 
      peak II, DS-tII, accumulated in tissue over 16 h in vitro. This proteoglycan was 
      self-associating and contained clusters of iduronic acid residues along its Mr 26
      X 10(3) DS chains. It resisted extraction from the tissue with heparin, trypsin, 
      and detergent. No DS-tII was detected in the incubation medium. Instead, medium
      proteoglycans eluted as single Sepharose CL-6B-included peaks. DS chains from
      medium proteoglycans were shorter (Mr 18 X 10(3)) and had more regularly spaced
      iduronic acid residues than GAGs from DS-tII. The length and sulfation patterns
      of DS-mII GAG were similar to GAG from DS-tIA. Thus, glomeruli rapidly
      synthesized and released Sepharose CL-6B-included heparin-displaceable DS and HS 
      proteoglycans while retaining a Sepharose CL-6B-excluded self-associating DS
      proteoglycan and an intracellular HS.

TI  - Selective inhibition by ionophore A23187 of the enzyme isomerization in the

PG  - 16584-90
AB  - The effect of a lipophilic antibiotic, ionophore A23187, on the purified
      Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum was investigated. When the enzyme was
      pretreated with A23187 in the presence and absence of Ca2+, the Ca2+-dependent
      ATPase activity was inhibited almost completely, but the activity of the
      contaminating Mg2+-ATPase was unaffected. The steady state level of the
      phosphoenzyme (EP) from ATP or Pi was not substantially altered. When the
      pretreatment was performed in the presence of Ca2+, EP formation from ATP was
      only slightly retarded, but EP decomposition was strongly inhibited. Under these 
      conditions, the accumulated EP was ADP-sensitive. EP formation from Pi after
      chelating of Ca2+ was quite slow, whereas EP once formed was in rapid equilibrium
      with Pi of the medium. On the other hand, when the pretreatment was performed in 
      the absence of Ca2+, EP formation from ATP was extremely slow, but EP once formed
      was in rapid dynamic equilibrium with ATP of the medium. EP formation from Pi was
      very fast, and this EP was in rapid equilibrium with Pi of the medium. These
      results demonstrate that A23187 selectively inhibits isomerization of the enzyme 
      between the high Ca2+-affinity form and the low Ca2+-affinity form in the
      catalytic cycle, whether or not the enzyme is phosphorylated. This suggests that 
      interactions between the enzyme protein and the surrounding lipids could play a
      crucial role in this isomerization.

PG  - 16494-501
AB  - Preincubation of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the presence 
      of the calcium chelator, [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid]
      (EGTA), irreversibly uncouples calcium transport from ATP hydrolysis. Uncoupling 
      cannot be explained by increased membrane permeability, but is associated with
      decreased capacity of the Ca2+-ATPase to bind noncatalytic, tightly bound ATP and
      ADP (Berman, M. C. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 694, 95-121). The effects of
      EGTA-induced uncoupling on absorbance and fluorescence properties of the bound
      ATP analog, 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP),
      have been studied under static and turnover conditions. Binding of 4.5-4.9 nmol
      of TNP-ATP/mg, as determined by absorbance difference titration, was relatively
      unaffected in the uncoupled state. TNP-ATP, bound to coupled vesicles during
      turnover, showed 6-8-fold enhanced fluorescence and a shift in the difference
      absorbance maximum from 510 to 493 nm, indicating increased hydrophobicity of the
      noncatalytic site. Turnover-dependent fluorescence enhancement was diminished by 
      60-70% in the uncoupled state, while the absorbance maximum wavelength shift was 
      abolished. These data, correlating changes in the environment of the noncatalytic
      or regulatory nucleotide binding site on the Ca2+-ATPase with coupling activity, 
      indicate that uncoupling is an intramolecular process, involving a ligand binding
      site on the ATPase, and that exclusion of H2O from the site occupied by
      noncatalytic nucleotides, during at least part of the catalytic cycle, is an
      event associated with energy transduction.

      the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. Rate-limiting step(s) under different
      conditions.
PG  - 16372-84
AB  - We previously characterized the structural features of the interaction of
      sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes with nonsolubilizing concentrations of C12E8,
      the non-ionic detergent octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (Andersen, J.P., le
      Maire, M., Kragh-Hansen, V., Champeil, P., and Moller, J. V. (1983) Eur. J.
      Biochem. 134, 205-214). The present study characterizes especially the functional
      aspects and implications of the detergent-induced perturbation for an
      understanding of ATPase function. Perturbing detergent decreased Vmax, but left
      Ca2+ transport intact. Detergent incorporation affected neither the
      calcium-dependent phosphorylation from ATP, as judged from multimixer quenching
      experiments, nor the calcium-releasing transition between the two phosphoenzyme
      forms (Ca2E1P to E2P), as judged from kinetically resolved dual-wavelength
      measurements with the calcium-sensitive dye antipyrylazo III. However, the
      decrease in Vmax was accounted for by a decrease in the rate of enzyme
      dephosphorylation by a factor of 3-4, whereas the Ca2+-dependent transition
      between the nonphosphorylated enzyme forms (E2 to Ca2E1) was enhanced almost
      10-fold. Evidence of a conformational change of E2 by C12E8 toward that of the E1
      state to account for the perturbed reactions was obtained from experiments on
      vanadate reactivity and tryptic degradation pattern. Both direct and steady-state
      evidence was obtained for an acceleration by ATP of the Ca2E1P to E2P transition 
      which may account for the low affinity modulatory effect of the nucleotide on
      enzyme turnover. The kinetic data indicated that reduction of ATP hydrolysis by
      C12E8 coincided with conditions where E2P dephosphorylation becomes rate-limiting
      (high ATP concentration, low pH, absence of potassium). Otherwise, the Ca2E1P to 
      E2P transition is deduced to be a rate-limiting step for the ATPase cycle,
      whereas the potential for rate control of the cycle by modulation of the E2 to
      Ca2E1 transition is very small. Only in special circumstances (absence of
      potassium, high temperature, and using ITP as a substrate) did this transition
      become a rate-limiting step, subject to rate enhancement of the whole cycle by
      detergent perturbation.

TI  - Biosynthesis of sulfated asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on bovine lutropin.
PG  - 16309-16
AB  - The asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on bovine lutropin (bLH) are unusual,
      containing GalNAc and sulfate but no galactose or sialic acid. Oligosaccharides
      from metabolically radiolabeled or purified bLH consist of non- (neutral), mono- 
      (S-1), and di- (S-2) sulfated structures. We have previously shown that S-2 is a 
      complex type oligosaccharide bearing two peripheral branches with the sequence
      SO4----GalNAc----GlcNAc attached to a typical Man3GlcNAc2 core (Green, E.D., van 
      Halbeek, H., Boime, I., and Baenziger, J.U. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260,
      15623-15630). We have now characterized the S-1 oligosaccharides on bLH which, in
      contrast to S-2, consist of several different structures of both the hybrid and
      complex types. The sulfate on S-1 oligosaccharides is located exclusively within 
      the peripheral sequence SO4----GalNAc----GlcNAc. The GalNAc bearing hybrid
      structures, either with or without sulfate, cannot be processed to mono- or
      disulfated complex oligosaccharides due to the inability of either
      alpha-mannosidase II or GlcNAc-transferase II to act on GalNAc containing
      oligosaccharides. Since both Gal and GalNAc are added to oligosaccharides on some
      pituitary hormones, for example bovine and ovine follitropin and human lutropin, 
      the Gal- and GalNAc-transferases appear to be key elements in regulating the
      synthesis of sulfated oligosaccharides on bLH and the other pituitary
      glycoprotein hormones.

TI  - Biosynthesis of intestinal microvillar proteins. Processing of N-linked
      carbohydrate is not required for surface expression.
PG  - 777-82
AB  - Castanospermine, an inhibitor of glucosidase I, the initial enzyme in the
      trimming of N-linked carbohydrate, was used to study the importance of
      carbohydrate processing in the biosynthesis of microvillar enzymes in
      organ-cultured pig intestinal explants. For aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2),
      aminopeptidase A (EC 3.4.11.7), sucrase-isomaltase (EC 3.2.1.48-10) and
      maltase-glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.20), castanospermine caused the formation of novel
      transient forms of higher Mr than corresponding controls, indicating a blocked
      removal of glucose residues. For the first three enzymes, the 'mature'
      (Golgi-processed) forms were similar in size to or slightly smaller than
      corresponding controls and were, as shown for aminopeptidase N,
      endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, evidence of a blocked attachment of complex sugars. 
      Maltase-glucoamylase did not undergo conversion into a 'mature' form, suggesting 
      that, unlike other microvillar enzymes, it does not receive post-translational
      O-linked carbohydrate. Castanospermine suppressed the synthesis of the four
      enzymes, but did not block their transport to the microvillar membrane, showing
      that processing of N-linked carbohydrate is not required for microvillar
      expression. The proteinase inhibitor leupeptin partially restored the suppressed 
      synthesis, indicating that the majority of the wrongly processed enzymes,
      probably because of conformational instability, become degraded soon after
      synthesis rather than being transported to the microvillar membrane.

PG  - 731-7
AB  - Stimulated hydrolysis of the inositol phospholipids phosphatidylinositol
      4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] 
      was investigated by studying the phosphoinositides produced in a suspended
      preparation of plasma membranes by transference of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP. At
      basal Ca2+ concentration (calculated free Ca2+, 150 nM) phospholipid hydrolysis
      was stimulated either by the muscarinic agonists carbamoylcholine and bethanecol 
      or by the addition of the non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP, guanosine 5'-[beta
      gamma-imido]triphosphate [p(NH)ppG]. GTP was without effect on basal hyrolysis.
      Both GTP and p(NH)ppG enhanced the rapid (within 10 s) hydrolysis of PtdIns4P and
      PtdIns(4,5)P2 induced by carbamoylcholine in a dose-dependent manner. A rightward
      shift in the competition curve of carbamoylcholine for bound L-[3H]quinuclidinyl 
      benzilate was seen on addition of GTP or p(NH)ppG (100 microM) under
      phosphorylating conditions. Pretreatment of intact islet cells with Bordetella
      pertussis toxin, islet-activating protein (IAP) or treatment of membranes with
      IAP under conditions which elicited ADP-ribosylation of a protein of Mr 41,000
      was without effect on muscarinic binding, phosphoinositide phosphorylation or
      subsequent hydrolysis by carbamoylcholine. The findings indicate the involvement 
      of a GTP-binding protein in the coupling of the muscarinic receptor to
      phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the islet cell and suggest that this is distinct
      from the GTP-binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase which is
      covalently modified by IAP.

TI  - Prophylaxis of first variceal hemorrhage in patients with liver cirrhosis.
PG  - 1267-75
AB  - Prophylaxis of bleeding from esophageal varices is a very tempting concept at
      first glance, especially under the assumption of a high mortality associated with
      first variceal hemorrhage. Up to now four different measures have been tried for 
      prophylaxis: portacaval shunt operation, devascularization procedures,
      sclerotherapy, and drugs. With the exception of portacaval shunts, ongoing
      controlled trials show a weak trend toward reduction of variceal bleeding and
      prolongation of survival in selected patients with compensated cirrhosis and
      large varices. However, prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding must still be
      regarded as experimental and should be restricted to controlled clinical studies.

      coated pits.
PG  - 117-25
AB  - Localized coated pits are considered in the primary steps of receptor-mediated
      endocytosis. According to the pit reinsertion mechanism, we have modified our
      previous kinetic model and studied the effect of diffusion on the trapping rate
      constant (k+). Using experimental data for low density lipoprotein (LDL)
      receptors on fibroblast cells, we found that the binding of receptors to coated
      pits is not totally diffusion controlled. For example, the process is less than
      78% diffusion controlled if receptors are not allowed to escape the coated pits. 
      However, due to the large uncertainties in the experimental parameters, a
      diffusion-controlled process cannot be ruled out. The greatest differences
      between localized and random reinsertion were found when the escaping rate
      constant (k-) is much greater than the rate constant for invagination of the pits
      (lambda 1). Under this condition, k+ for localized reinsertion is no less than
      39% diffusion controlled, while k+ for random reinsertion shows no diffusion
      effect at all.

PG  - 599-606
AB  - The establishment of myxomatosis, the spread of the disease and its effects on
      rabbit populations in Australia and in Britain are briefly reviewed. Though the
      disease is endemic, with regular outbreaks in most rabbit populations, its effect
      is now much less dramatic than previously. Recent epidemiological studies have
      shown that the rate of spread of infection, the proportion of rabbits infected
      and the proportion dying from the disease are very much smaller than recorded in 
      earlier outbreaks. The reasons for these changes are discussed, and the
      epidemiology of the disease in Britain is compared with that in Australia.

PG  - 533-70
AB  - Recent theoretical and empirical studies of the population biology of infectious 
      diseases have helped to improve our understanding of the major factors that
      influence the three phases of a successful invasion, namely initial
      establishment, persistence in the longer term and spread to other host
      communities. Of central importance in all three phases is the magnitude of the
      basic reproductive rate or transmission potential of the parasite. The value of
      this parameter is determined by a variety of biological properties of the
      association between an individual parasite and its host and the interaction
      between their populations. The recent epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency
      syndrome (AIDS) in North America and Europe is employed to illustrate the factors
      that promote disease establishment and spread. The frequency distribution of the 
      number of different sexual partners per unit of time within homosexual
      communities is shown to be of central importance with respect to future trends in
      the incidence of AIDS. Broader aspects of pathogen invasion are examined by
      reference to simple mathematical models of three species associations, which
      mirror parasite introduction into resident predator-prey, host-parasite and
      competitive interactions. Many outcomes are possible, depending on the values of 
      the numerous parameters that influence multi-species population interactions.
      Pathogen invasion is shown to have far-reaching implications for the structure
      and stability of ecological communities.

TI  - [H2 antagonists and the heart].
PG  - 2209-15
AB  - The large scale use of drugs that block tissue histamine receptors (H1 and H2)
      creates the problem of possible side effects due to the inhibition of the
      physiological role of histamine on certain systems and/or the direct action of
      histamine receptor blockers. In the case of H2 antagonists the effects on the
      heart so far reported are few but are considered important since they suggest the
      presence of physiological mechanisms that are as yet imperfectly understood. The 
      literature on the cardiac effects of cimetidine and ranitidine is reviewed and
      the extent of the effect of the two drugs is outlined on the basis of an analysis
      of cases presented, experimental protocols and the various hypotheses put
      forward. Apart from the speculative interest of the study, a possible
      predisposition to the cardiac effects of cimetidine and ranitidine is identified 
      in patients with major basal pathologies or in critical conditions. On the basis 
      of the large numbers treated worldwide and the sporadic reports of cardiac
      effects it is concluded that the drugs are very easily handled even from the
      viewpoint of cardiac effects.

TI  - Close association between clathrin and the hydrophobic domain of boundary
      membranes in brain endocytic vesicles.
PG  - 878-83
AB  - Purified bovine brain clathrin binds readily, in a pH-dependent fashion, to
      protein-free phospholipid bilayers. The association is tight and leads to
      inter-bilayer fusion, however, photolabeling studies using the amphiphilic
      photoreactive glycolipid 12-(4-azido-2-nitrophenoxy)stearoyl[1-14C]glucosamine
      provide no evidence for direct insertion of clathrin into the central,
      hydrophobic domain of of these target membranes. In contrast, similar
      photolabeling studies of isolated, intact clathrin-coated vesicles show that, in 
      these structures, clathrin is readily accessible to a probe which is known to
      reside preferentially within the hydrophobic domain of the membrane. The results 
      are consistent with a natural requirement, by clathrin, for accessory proteins in
      order to effect membrane penetration.

AB  - Enhancer sequences analysed using the informational spectrum method (ISM) show a 
      characteristic frequency at .0488. It has been shown that the characteristic
      frequency for some DNA binding proteins overlaps the characteristic frequency of 
      their target DNA sequences. We suggest here that two types of proteins,
      homeoproteins and the glucocorticoid receptors, might bind to enhancer sequences.

TI  - Agents inducing high Mg2+-ATPase activity of isolated coupling factor 1 from
      spinach chloroplasts.
PG  - 636-42
AB  - Conditions are reported under which purified coupling factor 1 (CF1) from spinach
      chloroplasts exhibits Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity of about 120 mumoles/min/mg 
      protein. It is shown that CF1, partially activated by treatment with heat and
      dithiothreitol (DTT), can be further activated by octyl glucoside. The
      Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity increases linearly as a function of the
      concentration of octyl glucoside from about 20 mumoles/min/mg protein in the
      absence of detergent to 120 mumoles/min/mg protein in the presence 15 mM octyl
      glucoside. This concentration is below the critical micellar concentration (CMC) 
      of the detergent, indicating that the monomeric form is responsible for the
      activation. Without treatment with heat and DTT, the Mg2+-dependent ATPase
      activity of CF1 is virtually zero, but can be stimulated by octyl glucoside. In
      this case, however, only concentrations around CMC give a substantial increase in
      activity (about 50 mumoles/min/mg at 28 mM octyl glucoside). Concentrations
      higher than CMC inhibit both latent and heat-activated CF1.

TI  - Identification of a novel Mr = 76-kDa form of beta-adrenergic receptors.
PG  - 411-7
AB  - The structure of the human beta-adrenergic receptor in purified basal membranes
      of human placental syncytiotrophoblast was probed using photoaffinity labeling.
      Basal membranes display a high specific activity of receptors (4-5 pmol/mg
      protein) and possess both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors subtypes.
      Autoradiography of membranes that were incubated with the beta-adrenergic
      antagonist [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol, photolyzed and then subjected to sodium
      dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identified four radiolabeled
      peptides, Mr = 65-kDa, 54-kDa, 43-kDa and a novel higher molecular weight 76-kDa 
      form of the receptor. Photoaffinity labeling of each of these four peptides
      displayed the pharmacological properties expected for true beta-adrenergic
      receptors. The 76-kDa photoaffinity labeled receptor peptide observed in human
      placenta basal membranes has not been reported elsewhere. Competition studies
      with the beta1-selective ligand CGP-20712A demonstrate that the photoaffinity
      labeled receptor peptides are composed of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic
      receptor subtypes.

TI  - Calcium antagonists and the second drug for hypertensive therapy.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - Calcium antagonist monotherapy is more effective in older patients and in those
      with low plasma renin activity, whereas beta blockers control blood pressure
      better in younger patients and in those with normal or high renin activity.
      Monotherapy with a calcium antagonist has been shown to result in the reduction
      of diastolic blood pressure to equal to or less than 95 mm Hg in more than 80
      percent of patients with essential hypertension. We investigated the
      antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil plus an angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor and nifedipine plus a beta blocker in 24 patients (aged 41 to 68) with 
      moderate to severe hypertension in whom monotherapy with a calcium antagonist had
      been ineffective. Blood pressure recorded in patients during the placebo period
      was 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). Twelve patients received
      monotherapy with nifedipine (50.0 +/- 5.2 mg per day) and 12 others received
      verapamil (460 +/- 20 mg per day); neither treatment resulted in the reduction of
      diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg. However, this goal was achieved
      when atenolol (89.5 +/- 25.7 mg per day) was added to the regimen of patients
      receiving nifedipine and enalapril (29.5 +/- 5.0 mg per day) was added to the
      regimen of those receiving verapamil; resultant blood pressures were 127 +/- 3/83
      +/- 2 mm Hg and 137 +/- 5/85 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. It is suggested that in
      patients in whom hypertension is inadequately controlled by calcium antagonist
      monotherapy, counter-regulatory mechanisms can be blocked by the addition of a
      beta blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to the calcium
      antagonist regimen, resulting in greatly improved, simple, well-tolerated, and
      safe control of blood pressure.

TI  - Strategies in antihypertensive therapy: implications of the kidney.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - Because we so rarely know the cause of hypertension, antihypertensive therapy
      remains empiric. However, certain principles of treatment are emerging; one of
      these concerns the critical role of the kidney in antihypertensive therapy.
      Whether or not the kidney is primarily responsible for hypertension in a patient,
      it is the patient's renal response to treatment that determines, to a major
      degree, an agent's efficacy. Vasodilators have been a conceptually attractive
      approach to the treatment of high blood pressure, because they decrease total
      peripheral resistance, which is considered to be the mechanism responsible for
      this condition in most patients. Nonspecific vasodilators exert a series of
      actions on the kidney--including profound sodium retention and reactive renin
      release--that limits therapeutic response. For reasons that are not yet clear,
      but are apparently related to specific action on calcium entry into vascular
      smooth muscle, endocrine function, and renal hemodynamics, calcium channel
      blocking agents, such as nifedipine, have an advantage in the treatment of
      hypertension. They cause little or no sodium retention; thus, the addition of a
      diuretic agent is not required. In fact, there is evidence that sodium loading in
      certain patients may potentiate the antihypertensive efficacy of these drugs. The
      renin-angiotensin system seems to be activated to a somewhat lesser degree by
      calcium channel blocking agents than it is by nonspecific vasodilators; in
      addition, these agents interfere with the actions of angiotensin on aldosterone
      release. Moreover, their dilator action on the renal blood supply favors sodium
      excretion. Nifedipine either has no effect on the renal blood supply or induces
      an increase in renal blood flow and maintains glomerular filtration rate, both of
      which combine to support the ensuing natriuresis.

PG  - 275-80
AB  - The irreversible anticholinesterase, di-isopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), was shown
      to be antinociceptive in the paw pressure test in rats only at doses where
      animals exhibited marked signs of anticholinesterase poisoning. At
      sub-antinociceptive doses DFP potentiated the opioid drugs fentanyl and
      alfentanil but failed to alter morphine antinociception. These interactions
      differ from our previous studies using the hot plate test in mice and suggest
      that opioid/cholinergic interactions are species and test dependent.

TI  - Changes in urinary and renal tubular enzymes caused by subchronic administration 
      of ochratoxin A in rats.
PG  - 233-43
AB  - The activities of 5 enzymes in urine and renal tubules were measured after
      administration to male Wistar rats of small doses of ochratoxin A (145
      micrograms/kg per day for 8-12 weeks, corresponding to 2 ppm in the feed) by
      intubation. These doses are in the range of natural contaminations found in food 
      and feed. The enzymes examined were gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT),
      alkaline phosphatase (ALP), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), lactate dehydrogenase
      (LDH), and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). The doses employed caused
      increased enzymuria and lower activities of tubular enzymes after 1 week of
      feeding. This suggests tubular injury. The change of the enzyme activities in the
      urine and in the tubules appeared in a cyclic way (degeneration and
      regeneration). Phenylalanine (20 ppm) partially prevented this action of
      ochratoxin A. The p-[14C]aminohippurate accumulation was inhibited by 60% in the 
      second week but returned to almost normal level 6 weeks after the beginning of
      the treatment, suggesting an adaptation of the organism or a substitution of
      damaged cells.

      cell lines immortalized by and producing human T-cell leukemia virus type-I
      (HTLV-I) in order to serve as an animal model of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The
      autologous cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) from each monkey by co-cultivation with lethally irradiated MT-2 cells
      producing HTLV-I. All of these cell lines, which had monkey karyotypes, grew
      continuously without addition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and expressed
      virus-specific proteins of HTLV-I and IL-2 receptor. After inoculation with the
      autologous cell lines, specific antibodies against HTLV-I proteins could be
      detected in their plasma, and transformed HTLV-I-infected cells could be
      recovered from their peripheral blood for at least 6 months. However, no signs of
      ATL have been observed to data, i.e. 2 years after inoculation.

AB  - Antibodies to HTLV-I have been detected in sera from 15 (2.0%) of 736 adult
      blood-donors in Nigeria, in 4 (20.0%) of 20 patients with chronic lymphatic
      leukaemia, 3 (10.0%) of 30 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one of 12 with Burkitt's 
      lymphoma and one of 7 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The frequency of
      positivity was higher (3.6%) in the blood-donors from the guinea and wooded
      savanna of northern Nigeria than in those from the rain-forest and mangrove
      swamps of southern Nigeria (1.8% in Lagos and 0.7% in Calabar). Two of the 3
      seropositive patients with lymphoma had clinical presentation and courses similar
      to those of Japanese and Caribbean patients with adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma.

      as determinants of HLTV-I infection in an urban Trinidadian community.
PG  - 801-8
AB  - The presence of antibody to human T-cell leukaemia virus (HLTV-I) has been
      assessed in 2,143 men and women who represent 83% of all adults aged 35 to 69
      years resident in a defined urban community in Trinidad. Individuals of African
      descent had a higher sero-positivity rate (7.0%) than those originating from
      India (1.4%), Europe (0%) or of mixed descent (2.7%). Women were infected more
      frequently than men, and the prevalence of infection increased with age in both
      sexes. Sero-positivity rates were significantly increased in adults who lived in 
      housing of poor quality (p less than 0.001) or close to water courses (p less
      than 0.025). These data and others raise the possibility that one route of HLTV-I
      transmission may be via insect vectors under particular domestic circumstances.

TI  - Isolation of a cDNA for the rat heavy neurofilament polypeptide (NF-H).
PG  - 203-5
AB  - We have isolated from a rat brain lambda gt11 expression library two overlapping 
      cDNA clones of sizes 2.5 and 3.0 kb corresponding to the heavy neurofilament
      polypeptide (NF-H). The 2.5 kb insert apparently represents virtually the whole
      of the C-terminal tail, the 3.0 kb insert also encodes the conserved epitope for 
      the monoclonal antibody, anti-IFA. The identity of the cDNAs was established by
      comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with the known partial amino acid
      sequence of porcine NF-H. A repeat peptide sequence that may be a
      multiphosphorylation site was identified in the C-terminal non-helical tail.

TI  - Regulation of ATP hydrolase activity of the F0-F1 complex of rat-liver
      mitochondria during early hepatic regeneration.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - Submitochondrial particles prepared from rat liver in the early phase of hepatic 
      regeneration possess a reduced F1 content with respect to F0 in intact
      F0F1-H+-ATPase complexes. Analysis of ATP hydrolysis showed a significant
      difference in both ESMP and isolated F1 with regard to the higher affinity Km
      values (Km,1) obtained from Eadie-Hofstee plots. Both ESMP and F1 from
      regenerating rat liver showed much lower apparent Km,1 values (0.04 and 0.03 mM, 
      respectively) than the corresponding controls (0.08 mM for both ESMP and F1).
      Data presented here show that the residual F1 moieties have an altered kinetic
      pattern with regard to the competitive inhibitor adenosine
      5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate (K1 ESMP from regenerating rat liver = 0.67
      microM, K1 ESMP from control rat liver = 2.03 microM). This difference in
      affinity for [beta,gamma-imido]-ATP is also seen in isolated F1 (K1 regenerating 
      rat liver = 0.04 microM, K1 control rat liver = 0.22 microM). These data indicate
      that during the disruptive retrodifferential phase of hepatic regeneration,
      changes at the level of surviving F1 sectors of the F0-F1 ATPase may play a
      physiological role in preventing ATP hydrolysis in vivo in the brief period of
      low delta microH+, induced by the presence of non-F1-associated F0
      proton-conducting pathways.

      using two photolabile analogs.
PG  - 157-61
AB  - Nucleotide-binding sites on the chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) have been
      probed using two photoreactive ADP analogs: 2-azido-ADP (2-N3-ADP) and
      2',3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ADP (Bz-ADP). Photolabeling of the isolated CF1 with
      2-N3-ADP results in incorporation of the analog exclusively into the beta-subunit
      of the enzyme. The location of the nucleotide-binding site(s) within the
      beta-subunit of the CF1 was investigated using peptide mapping. Within the
      discrimination limits of this technique, it is concluded that the azido- and
      benzoyl-modified analogs both bind to the same conformation of the
      nucleotide-binding site(s) of soluble CF1. Bz-ADP, however, labels the binding
      site(s) on membrane-bound CF1 in a slightly different manner.

PG  - 152-6
AB  - Transport of cytoplasmically synthesized precursor proteins into or across the
      inner mitochondrial membrane requires a mitochondrial membrane potential. We have
      studied whether additional energy sources are also necessary for protein
      translocation. Reticulocyte lysate (containing radiolabelled precursor proteins) 
      and mitochondria were depleted of ATP by pre-incubation with apyrase. A membrane 
      potential was then established by the addition of substrates of the electron
      transport chain. Oligomycin was included to prevent dissipation of delta psi by
      the action of the F0F1-ATPase. Under these conditions, import of subunit beta of 
      F1-ATPase (F1 beta) was inhibited. Addition of ATP or GTP restored import. When
      the membrane potential was destroyed, however, the import of F1 beta was
      completely inhibited even in the presence of ATP. We therefore conclude that the 
      import of F1 beta depends on both nucleoside triphosphates and a membrane
      potential.

TI  - Effect of five structurally diverse H2-receptor antagonists on drug metabolism.
PG  - 4457-61
AB  - Some H2-receptor antagonists can interact with the biotransformation of other
      drugs. This is due to their binding to cytochrome P-450. We tested the in vitro
      effects of 5 different H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine (C), oxmetidine (O),
      ranitidine (R), famotidine (F) and nizatidine (N) on arylhydrocarbon-hydroxylase,
      7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase and 7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase activity using 
      liver microsomes from man as well as from untreated, phenobarbital and
      3-methylcholanthrene treated rats. In addition their binding to human microsomal 
      cytochrome P-450 was evaluated. The in vivo effects of these antagonists were
      investigated on the hepatic elimination of diazepam in healthy volunteers. In
      vitro O was found to be the most effective inhibitor of the enzyme activities
      studied. C showed a clear inhibitory effect only with rat liver microsomes
      whereas the remaining drugs were more than 10 times less potent. The binding
      affinities of these antagonists showed a similar tendency: the Ks-values for O, C
      and R were 0.2, 0.9 and 5.1 mM, respectively; for F and N no binding up to 4 mM
      could be observed. However, in man, only C inhibited the hepatic elimination of
      diazepam by about 45% while R, O, N and F did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
      diazepam. Thus, it could be concluded from our studies that one cannot
      extrapolate in vitro data of the inhibitory potency of H2-receptor antagonists in
      every case to human in vivo drug metabolism.

TI  - Molecular mapping of murine I region recombinants. II. Crossing over in the E
      beta gene is restricted to a 4.5 kb stretch of DNA that excludes the beta 1 exon.
PG  - 4004-9
AB  - The crossing over in five murine I-region recombinants (Is/Ik) was studied by
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis after Southern blot
      hybridization by using I-region-specific probes. These recombinants included
      three recently developed strains, B10.ASR1, B10.ASR11, and B10.ASR12; and two
      strains B10.S(9R) and B10.HTT derived earlier. Although these recombinants were
      reciprocal in haplotype orientation to the three recombinants we reported
      recently, these too crossed over within the same 7 kb stretch of DNA in the E
      beta gene. This 7 kb stretch of DNA included the 3' half of the first intron, the
      beta 1 exon, the second intron, and the beta 2 exon. A comparison of the cDNA
      sequences of the two parental E beta alleles revealed that although the beta 2
      exons were identical, there were several nucleotide differences between the two
      beta 1 exons. This allowed us to determine the parental origin of the beta 1 exon
      in the recombinants at the level of transcription by using S1 nuclease mapping.
      Thus we were able to show that in each case the 3' portion of the first intron
      and the beta 1 exon were upstream from the site of crossover. All eight
      recombinants involving the k and s haplotypes now can be mapped within a 4.5 kb
      stretch of DNA, which includes only the beta 1-beta 2 intron and the beta 2 exon 
      of the E beta gene. These findings imply that the I-E molecules expressed in
      these recombinants will probably have conserved sequences and therefore will
      exhibit identical I-E-restricted immune responses, despite the fact that crossing
      over could have occurred at different sites within the beta 1-beta 2 intron.

TI  - Chromosomal location of the genes encoding complement components C5 and factor H 
      in the mouse.
PG  - 3990-5
AB  - Complementary DNA probes corresponding to the factor H and C5 polypeptides have
      been used to determine the chromosomal localizations of these two complement
      components. Both probes revealed complex and polymorphic arrays of DNA fragments 
      in Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA. Following the distribution of
      these bands in panels of somatic cell hybrids carrying various combinations of
      mouse chromosomes on a constant rat or Chinese hamster background allowed the
      localization of the C5-associated fragments to proximal chromosome 2 and the
      localization of the factor H-associated fragments to chromosome 1 or chromosome
      3. Following the inheritance of DNA restriction fragment-length polymorphisms
      revealed by the probes in recombinant inbred mouse strains allowed the factor
      H-associated fragments to be mapped to Sas-1 on chromosome 1, and the
      C5-associated fragments to be mapped to Hc. Analysis of three-point crosses, in
      turn, placed the latter locus 19 cM distal to Sd on chromosome 2. We have
      designated the two loci Cfh and C5, respectively. This genetic analysis raises
      the possibility that C5 and factor H are both encoded by complex loci composed of
      distinct structural and regulatory genes.

TI  - Expression of immunoglobulin lambda light chain by the promyelocytic cell line
      HL-60.
PG  - 3978-82
AB  - The HL-60 cell line, established from a patient with acute promyelocytic
      leukemia, can be induced to undergo differentiation along the granulocyte or
      monocyte/macrophage line, depending on the particular inducer that is used. In
      this communication we provide evidence that HL-60 cells also have B lymphoid
      characteristics because by flow cytometry and clonal excess calculations, these
      cells are found to express immunoglobulin (Ig) lambda light chains on their
      surface. Furthermore, HL-60 cells contain poly(A)+ RNA that hybridizes with a DNA
      fragment encoding the constant region of Ig lambda chains and comigrates with
      lambda mRNA on RNA blots. Treatment of HL-60 cells with a phorbol ester that
      induces monocyte/macrophage differentiation resulted in the loss of surface Ig
      lambda chains and lambda RNA.

TI  - Transforming growth factor beta is an important immunomodulatory protein for
      human B lymphocytes.
PG  - 3855-60
AB  - The growth and differentiation of B cells to immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting cells 
      is regulated by a variety of soluble factors. This study presents data that
      support a role for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in this regulatory
      process. B lymphocytes were shown to have high-affinity receptors for TGF-beta
      that were increased fivefold to sixfold after in vitro activation. The addition
      of picogram quantities of TGF-beta to B cell cultures suppressed
      factor-dependent, interleukin 2 (IL 2) B cell proliferation and markedly
      suppressed factor-dependent (IL 2 or B cell differentiation factor) B cell Ig
      secretion. In contrast, the constitutive IgG production by an Epstein Barr
      virus-transformed B cell line was not modified by the presence of TGF-beta in
      culture. This cell line was found to lack high-affinity TGF-beta receptors. The
      degree of inhibition of B cell proliferation observed in in vitro cultures was
      found to be dependent not only on the concentration of TGF-beta added but also on
      the concentration of the growth stimulatory substance (IL 2) present. By
      increasing the IL 2 concentrations in culture, the inhibition of proliferation
      induced by TGF-beta could be partially overcome. In contrast, the inhibition of
      Ig secretion induced by TGF-beta could not be overcome by a higher concentration 
      of stimulatory factor, demonstrating that the suppression of B cell
      differentiation by TGF-beta is not due solely to its effects on proliferation.
      Furthermore, it was demonstrated that B lymphocytes secrete TGF-beta. Unactivated
      tonsillar B cells had detectable amounts of TGF-beta mRNA on Northern blot
      analysis, and B cell activation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) resulted
      in a twofold to threefold increase in TGF-beta mRNA. Supernatants conditioned by 
      unactivated B cells had small amounts of TGF-beta, SAC activation of the B cells 
      resulted in a sixfold to sevenfold increase in the amount of TGF-beta present in 
      the supernatants. Thus, B lymphocytes synthesize and secrete TGF-beta and express
      receptors for TGF-beta. The addition of exogenous TGF-beta to cultures of
      stimulated B cells inhibits subsequent proliferation and Ig secretion. TGF-beta
      may function as an autocrine growth inhibitor that limits B lymphocyte
      proliferation and ultimate differentiation.

TI  - Characterization of covalently cross-linked pancreatic somatostatin receptors.
PG  - 16738-43
AB  - The receptor for somatostatin present in rat pancreatic plasma membranes was
      characterized by affinity labeling with [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin utilizing three 
      different heterobifunctional cross-linking agents:
      N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxy-succinimide, N-succinimidyl 6-(4-azido
      2'-nitrophenylamine)hexanoate, and N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 4-azido-benzoate.
      Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
      autoradiography revealed a broad band of Mr = 92,000 when any of the three
      cross-linkers was used; N-succinimidyl 6-(4-azido 2'-nitrophenylamine), however, 
      was most efficient. Labeling of the Mr = 92,000 protein band was not affected by 
      reducing agents but was sensitive to somatostatin and guanine nucleotides,
      particularly GTP gamma S, at concentrations which reduced binding to the
      receptor. The affinity-labeled protein could be solubilized completely with
      Zwittergent 3-12, partially with Triton X-100 and
      3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, and poorly with
      Zwittergent 3-08 and digitonin. When exposed to agarose-coupled lectins, the
      detergent solubilized, labeled Mr = 92,000 protein was completely adsorbed to
      wheat germ agglutinin, partially to ricin communis II, and not at all to
      concanavalin A or lotus or lentil lectin. The Mr = 92,000 protein bound to wheat 
      germ agglutinin-agarose was not eluted by N-acetylglucosamine but was by
      triacetylchitotriose, providing a considerable purification of the somatostatin
      receptor. These data allow us to conclude that the somatostatin receptor is a
      monomeric glycoprotein with an Mr = 90,000 binding subunit which probably
      contains a polymeric arrangement of N-acetylglucosamine residues.

AB  - DNA entrapped in liposomes containing lactosylceramide in the bilayers is found
      to be associated with clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from the rat livers after
      intravenous injection of these liposomes. The presence of the exogenous DNA in
      the coated vesicles was detected by Southern blotting. The amount of DNA present 
      in the coated vesicles does not appear to vary up to 4 h after injection of the
      liposomes into the animals. The recognition of the lactosyl group present in the 
      liposome by the galactose receptor present on the surface of the different liver 
      cells may lead to their internalization in a way analogous to receptor-mediated
      endocytosis of various macromolecules. DNA present in the lumen of the coated
      vesicles is found to be biologically active as evidenced by its replication in
      bacterial cells and mouse fibroblasts.

PG  - 16484-93
AB  - beta-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids was studied with isolated solubilized
      or nonsolubilized peroxisomes or with perfused liver isolated from rats treated
      with clofibrate. gamma-Linolenic acid gave the higher rate of beta-oxidation,
      while arachidonic acid gave the slower rate of beta-oxidation. Other
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (including docosahexaenoic acid) were oxidized at
      rates which were similar to, or higher than, that observed with oleic acid.
      Experiments with 1-14C-labeled polyunsaturated fatty acids demonstrated that
      these are chain-shortened when incubated with nonsolubilized peroxisomes.
      Spectrophotometric investigation of solubilized peroxisomal incubations showed
      that 2,4-dienoyl-CoA esters accumulated during peroxisomal beta-oxidation of
      fatty acids possessing double bond(s) at even-numbered carbon atoms.
      beta-Oxidation of [1-14C]docosahexaenoic acid by isolated peroxisomes was
      markedly stimulated by added NADPH or isocitrate. This fatty acid also failed to 
      cause acyl-CoA-dependent NADH generation with conditions of assay which
      facilitate this using other acyl-CoA esters. These findings suggest that
      2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase participation is essential during peroxisomal
      beta-oxidation if chain shortening is to proceed beyond a delta 4 double bond.
      Evidence obtained using arachidionoyl-CoA, [1-14C]arachidonic acid, and
      [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid suggests that peroxisomal beta-oxidation
      also can proceed beyond a double bond positioned at an odd-numbered carbon atom. 
      Experiments with isolated perfused livers showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids
      also in the intact liver are substrates for peroxisomal beta-oxidation, as judged
      by increased levels of the catalase-H2O2 complex on infusion of polyunsaturated
      fatty acids.

AB  - The present study investigated the possibility that pyrroloquinolinequinone
      (PQQ), an aromatic carbonyl recently indicated to be the carbonyl cofactor in
      bovine plasma amine oxidase, may also be present at the active site of lysyl
      oxidase. The absorption and resonance Raman spectra of the phenylhydrazones of
      bovine plasma amine oxidase, of peptides derived from the active site of bovine
      aorta lysyl oxidase, and of PQQ were very similar, indicating that the carbonyl
      cofactor of lysyl oxidase is PQQ or a compound which closely resembles PQQ.

TI  - Enhancement of methotrexate nephrotoxicity after cisplatin therapy.
PG  - 2617-21
AB  - We measured urinary levels of total protein, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase
      (NAG), alanine aminopeptidase, and adenosine deaminase-binding protein in ten
      children with osteogenic sarcoma who were receiving combination chemotherapy that
      included 12 doses of methotrexate (12 g/m2). Analysis of the changes in these
      sensitive markers of renal tubular damage permitted detection of subclinical
      methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity. In the absence of cisplatin, methotrexate
      therapy was associated with significant but transient increases in each of the
      four markers. Irreversible nephrotoxicity, indicated by persistent rises in NAG
      and alanine aminopeptidase as well as increased serum creatinine levels, was
      associated with doses of methotrexate that followed the administration of
      cisplatin (400 mg/m2). The biphasic pattern of total protein and NAG excretion
      observed in all patients suggests more than one mechanism of methotrexate-induced
      nephrotoxicity. Monitoring renal tubular damage in patients who are receiving
      methotrexate in combined-drug regimens would provide useful information for
      scheduling nephrotoxic drugs in clinical trials.

TI  - Evaluation of p-amidinophenyl esters as potential antithrombotic agents.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - Three p-amidinophenyl esters have been synthesized and characterized as
      irreversible inhibitors of the vitamin-K dependent proteinases; factors IXa, Xa
      and thrombin (Turner et al. [4]).+ In the present report we describe the in vitro
      and in vivo effects of these agents on standard coagulation tests in vitro and in
      blood from animals treated with the compounds. At a concentration of 500 microM, 
      the three esters increased the activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of
      pooled human plasma 3 to 5-fold. The prothrombin time increased 1.4 to 3.7-fold
      under similar conditions. The p-amidinophenyl ester of cinnamic acid (CINN)
      showed the most pronounced effect on both assays. This ester also is the best
      inhibitor of human factors IXa and Xa, while the p-amidinophenyl ester of benzoic
      acid (BENZ) is a slightly better alpha-thrombin inhibitor (4). The effect of
      these esters on the thrombin clotting time correlated with in vitro kinetic
      measurements of alpha-thrombin inhibition rates. Both BENZ and CINN increased the
      assay endpoint more than 6-fold. The three esters also were studied using mouse
      plasma. A comparable effect on the PTT was noted. Intravenous administration of
      300 microliter of 1 mM CINN as a single bolus in mice caused a 2.3-fold increase 
      in the PTT which remained 1.2-fold normal 2 h later. The BENZ and
      alpha-methyl-cinnamic acid (MECINN) esters were somewhat less effective as
      predicted from their in vitro effect on the PTT. This investigation and previous 
      studies indicate that these compounds demonstrate low toxicity at therapeutic
      levels. It is concluded that the p-amidinophenyl esters may be useful in
      antithrombotic therapy.

TI  - Quantitative immunoblotting of plasma and platelet protein S.
PG  - 382-6
AB  - Protein S, the activated protein C cofactor, was measured in plasma and in
      platelets by a quantitative immunoblotting assay using a double antibody
      technique. Either whole plasma or platelet lysates were electrophoresed on sodium
      dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
      by electroblotting. Based on the demonstration of proportional transfer of
      protein S from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane, a reproducible and
      sensitive quantitative assay for protein S antigen (approximately 70,000 MW) was 
      developed that correlated well with the Laurell rocket assay for plasma protein
      S. Pooled normal plasma contains 22 micrograms/ml protein S. Total platelet
      protein S antigen at approximately 70,000 MW was determined in gel filtered
      platelets of ten healthy adults (mean, 163 ng per 10(8) platelets). In the
      supernatants of thrombin-stimulated platelets, 63% of the total platelet protein 
      S antigen was measured. Thus, quantitative immunoblotting is a useful method to
      detect low levels of protein S in platelets or in plasma with the advantage of
      giving qualitative information, i.e. apparent MW, of protein S.

TI  - Immunoradiometric assays for human coagulation factor VII using polyclonal
      antibodies against the Ca(II)-dependent and Ca(II)-independent conformation.
PG  - 343-8
AB  - Human coagulation factor VII is a trace plasma protein belonging to the vitamin
      K-dependent factors. Two specific and sensitive immunoradiometric assays for
      factor VII were developed using immunopurified rabbit antibodies against the
      Ca(II)-independent and Ca(II)-dependent conformation of factor VII. Both assays
      were insensitive to the activation state of factor VII. The distribution of
      factor VII antigen was studied in 40 healthy individuals and the antigen level in
      normal plasma was calculated to be 0.52-0.62 micrograms/ml. The two assays were
      used in a comparative study of factor VII procoagulant activity and factor VII
      antigen in patients treated with oral anticoagulants.

TI  - A monoclonal antibody that does not recognize tissue-type plasminogen activator
      bound to its naturally occurring inhibitor.
PG  - 328-32
AB  - Hybridoma clones specific for tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) were
      screened in solid-phase radioimmunoassays for their reactivity toward free tPA
      and tPA complexed to the endothelial cell-derived, beta-migrating plasminogen
      activator inhibitor (beta-PAI). Two monoclonal antibodies (MABs) were identified 
      with quite distinct properties. The first, MAB LI72D1, bound to free tPA but did 
      not recognize tPA complexed to the beta-PAI, whereas the second, MAB HI72C1,
      bound both to free tPA and to tPA in complex with beta-PAI. These properties were
      maintained when the MABs were immobilized to plastic microtiter wells, thus
      permitting the development of immunoradiometric assays (IRMAs) to quantitate free
      tPA and total tPA antigen in various samples. The IRMAs were employed to analyze 
      the tPA in media conditioned by several human cell types. The results indicate
      that in some cases, tPA may be present entirely as a free and active enzyme,
      while in others it apparently exists entirely in complex with beta-PAI.
      Interestingly, some cells appear to contain both forms of tPA.

TI  - Verapamil inhibits platelet aggregation by a calcium-independent mechanism.
PG  - 308-10
AB  - We studied the inhibitory effects of the calcium channel blocker verapamil both
      on platelet aggregation and intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i in platelets loaded
      with a fluorescent indicator (quin 2). The inhibitory effects of verapamil on the
      platelet aggregation response to both thrombin and ionomycin were seen to be
      clearly dissociated from the verapamil-induced inhibition of the [Ca2+]i increase
      produced by these agonists. Verapamil-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation 
      was also obtained when using the "calcium-independent" agonist phorbol-myristate 
      acetate (PMA). It may be deduced that a calcium-independent mechanism plays a
      role in verapamil-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation. We postulate that
      this mechanism may operate via a protein-kinase C pathway.

TI  - Comparative turn-over of heparin cofactor II and antithrombin III in baboons.
      Influence of heparin and pentosan polysulfate administration.
PG  - 302-7
AB  - Heparin and pentosan polysulfate (PPS) interact in plasma with antithrombin III
      (AT III) and Heparin cofactor II (HC II) respectively. To assess the influence of
      heparin or PPS treatment on the metabolism of their respective cofactors, we
      performed a double tracer study in baboons receiving heparin or PPS. Purified AT 
      III and HC II from human plasma were labelled with 131I and 125I respectively by 
      the lactoperoxidase-glucose oxidase technique. The tracers had unchanged
      biological activities, were homogeneous in SDS-PAGE, migrated as native proteins 
      by crossed immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of heparin or PPS and virtually 
      coeluted with endogenous baboon proteins from heparin-agarose. Nine animals were 
      randomly allocated to receive, during the metabolic study, heparin (500 IU/kg/d, 
      n = 3), PPS (5 mg/kg,d, n = 3) or a placebo (n = 3) given in 2 daily subcutaneous
      injections. Heparin levels and anticoagulant effects were similar in extent and
      duration to those usually achieved in man. The plasma concentrations of AT III
      and HC II did not vary under treatment. The half-life of the elimination phase in
      the placebo group ranged from 1.95 to 2.33 d for AT III and from 1.96 to 2.21 d
      for HC II. There was no significant difference in the half-lives of the 2
      inhibitors between the placebo group and the animals receiving heparin or PPS.
      This suggest that clinical conditions associated with heparin treatment may be
      important for the effect of heparin on AT III metabolism previously reported in
      patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Effect of pentosan polysulphate administration in man on the formation of
      covalent complexes between heparin cofactor II and thrombin generated in plasma
      by contact activation.
PG  - 295-8
AB  - An assay for the quantification of pentosan polysulphate (PPS) in plasma is
      described. As PPS has been shown to potentiate thrombin inhibition by the second 
      heparin cofactor (HC II), the principle of this assay was to measure the
      formation of covalent complexes between HC II and the thrombin generated in
      plasma after contact activation and recalcification. The complexes were
      quantified by using purified 125I-HC II added to the plasma as a tracer and
      SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The assay was sensitive to low
      PPS concentrations (limit of detection: 0.1 microgram/ml) and therefore suitable 
      for the measurement of PPS in plasma after its administration to man. The
      clearance of PPS was studied in 3 subjects receiving respectively 10, 50 and 100 
      mg intravenously (IV) and in 3 subjects receiving 35 mg subcutaneously (SC). PPS 
      was still detectable 8 h after 50 and 100 mg IV and 6 h after 35 mg SC. The
      activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was, in comparison, relatively
      insensitive but for concentrations above 1 microgram/ml the values derived from
      the APTT and from the SDS-PAGE method fitted. The results were also in general
      agreement with those reported by McGregor et al. (5) who used a sensitive
      competitive binding assay. This indicates that low concentrations of PPS
      previously measured chemically are also pharmacologically active in plasma.

TI  - Characterization of four monoclonal antibodies to factor VIII coagulant protein
      and their use in immunopurification of factor VIII.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - Four monoclonal anti-VIII:C antibodies were obtained from the fusion of the
      splenocytes of one Balb/C mouse with a specific activity ranging from 2.3 to
      45,000 U/mg when purified from ascitic fluid. Only one antibody was able to
      inhibit completely Factor VIII:C in normal plasma. The four antibodies could bind
      Factor VIII:CAg in plasma and commercial concentrate both in liquid and solid
      phase, and were suitable for immunopurification of Factor VIII:C. Three
      antibodies competed with polyclonal anti-VIII:CAg Fab' in a liquid phase IRMA,
      and all of them were able to displace their own binding to Factor VIII:CAg.
      Competition studies between monoclonal antibodies for the binding to Factor
      VIII:CAg were performed and showed the recognition of different epitopes and
      various functional impact. These studies indicate that at least one antibody,
      with the lowest anti-VIII:C titer clearly recognizes a different epitope of
      VIII:C than those recognized by the others. Affinity constants ranged from 10(9) 
      to 10(10) l/mole.

TI  - An enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for the quantitation of human factor VII.
PG  - 250-5
AB  - A new solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the
      quantitation of human Factor VII antigen (F VII Ag), using a monospecific rabbit 
      anti-F VII antiserum. Anti-F VII F(ab')2 fragments were adsorbed to polystyrene
      plates. The binding of serial dilutions of control or test plasma, containing F
      VII, was detected by incubation with peroxidase-labeled anti- FV II IgG followed 
      by the addition of hydrogen peroxyde and O-phenylenediamine. This ELISA is
      specific, sensitive (detection limit: 0.05%) and accurate (coefficient of
      variation: 1.5-4% for within- and 1.6-9% for between-assays). F VII coagulant
      activity (F VII C) and F VII C) and F VII Ag were determined in large populations
      of controls and patients. In normal plasma (n = 38), F VII Ag ranged from 83 to
      117% and the correlation coefficient between F VII Ag and F VII C was 0.94. In
      patients with severe (F VII C inf. 1%) congenital F VII deficiency (n = 5), F VII
      Ag was undetectable in two cases (inf. 0.05%) and markedly reduced (0.35 to 5.6%)
      in the three other cases. In patients with liver cirrhosis (n = 15), F VII Ag
      ranged from 21% to 59% and was in good correlation with F VII C (r = 0.84). In
      dicoumarol treated patients (n = 15), the levels of F VII Ag ranged from 51% to
      79% and a poor correlation (r = 0.52) with F VII C was observed.(ABSTRACT

      pregnancy.
PG  - 247-9
AB  - Eight women who were going to have an abortion between the 18th and 23 week of
      gestation for chromosomal abnormalities or haemoglobinopathies received
      intravenously 50 mg of pentosan polysulfate (PSP). Maternal results of
      haemostasis prior and after the injection of the drug were compared. Fetal
      coagulation parameters were tested on samples obtained by direct puncture of the 
      umbilical cord under ultrasound guidance, 30 min after injection. Results were
      compared to those of normal fetuses at the same stage of gestation, obtained in
      the same conditions. In mothers' plasma, 30 min after injection, APTT was
      prolonged, factor Xa generation was markedly impaired, and factor V level was
      deeply decreased. By contrast, no modifications of these parameters were observed
      in fetal plasma, 30 min after the injection of PSP to their related mothers when 
      compared to control fetuses. Thus the absence of biological modifications induced
      by PSP injection could demonstrate that this drug does not cross through the
      placenta.

PG  - 65-74
AB  - The carbohydrate sequences of cell surface glycolipids change during
      differentiation and oncogenic transformation. To detect these structural changes,
      murine monoclonal antibodies have been produced in many different laboratories.
      Some of these antibodies are used to distinguish various cell types such as
      normal and transformed cells, while others are used to analyze developmentally
      regulated antigens. Recently, the structures of many of these carbohydrate
      antigens have been determined. The availability of these well-defined monoclonal 
      antibodies will be useful for the study of the regulation and function of
      glycoconjugates.

TI  - Antibodies to glycolipids in demyelinating diseases of the human peripheral
      nervous system.
PG  - 235-48
AB  - Antibodies to complex glycolipids occur in patients with a variety of diseases of
      the peripheral nervous system. Many patients with demyelinating neuropathy
      occurring in association with IgM paraproteinemia have a monoclonal antibody that
      reacts with a carbohydrate determinant shared between sulfate-3-glucuronyl
      paragloboside (SGPG), the myelin-associated glycoprotein and other glycoproteins 
      of peripheral nerve. Other patients with neuropathy in association with IgM
      paraproteinemia have monoclonal antibodies reacting with carbohydrate
      determinants on various gangliosides. More than 80% of the IgM monoclonal
      antibodies from patients of this type that have been screened in our laboratory
      react with SGPG or ganglioside antigens. High levels of antibodies reacting with 
      ganglioside antigens are also found in some patients with inflammatory
      neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome and chronic relapsing inflammatory
      polyneuropathy. The pathogenetic significance of these antibodies reacting with
      acidic sphingoglycolipids remains to be established.

TI  - Tumor-associated glycolipid antigens, their metabolism and organization.
PG  - 209-33
AB  - A number of experimental animal tumors as well as human cancers have been
      characterized by dramatic changes of glycolipid composition and metabolism. This 
      review focuses on the chemical and enzymatic basis of the appearance of
      tumor-associated glycolipid antigens belonging to four major structural classes, 
      i.e., globo, ganglio, lacto type 1, and lacto type 2 series. Some antigens
      represent the accumulation of precursors with deletion of more complex
      glycolipids, and others are the result of enhanced synthesis of new structures,
      most of which are aberrant fucosylation or sialylation or their combination;
      thus, novel structures such as di- or trimeric Le chi, trifucosyl Le gamma,
      sialyl Le chi, sialyl dimeric Le chi and disialyl Le alpha A have been isolated
      and characterized. Many monoclonal antibodies are capable of recognizing antigens
      in high density but are not capable of reacting with the same antigen in low
      density. Therefore, the expression of novel structures in high densities at the
      cell surface is important for recognition of tumor-association antigens.
      Molecular models of a typical tumor-associated antigen and its organization in
      membranes are also presented.

TI  - Animal glycolipids as attachment sites for microbes.
PG  - 153-72
AB  - The abundance of carbohydrate at the animal cell surface may explain why microbes
      have selected primarily carbohydrates as essential attachment sites for
      colonization or infection. Of the various surface glycoconjugates of interest,
      primary attention has been given to glycolipids, due in part to an efficient
      binding assay based on a thin-layer chromatogram with separated glycolipids. In
      this way the general character of carbohydrate recognition by microbes is being
      mapped. Mainly two examples are briefly described to illustrate some
      generalizations: lactosylceramide-recognition by several bacteria, and Gal alpha 
      l----4Gal-binding by Escherichia coli and the Shiga toxin. The unique recognition
      of internally placed sequences, the often low-affinity binding, and the
      preference of certain sequences before others are interpreted to be of decisive
      biological value. The binding to internal parts makes it technically possible to 
      approximate the binding epitope on a receptor glycolipid. For this the binding
      preferences to glycolipids carrying the binding site in different saccharide
      environments (isoreceptors) are compared with the computer-calculated preferred
      conformations (definition of steric hindrances to epitope access). Several
      binding epitopes dissected with this approach have a common surface character: a 
      nonpolar area of ring hydrogens over one or two sugars, surrounded by polar
      oxygens or amide. This is in agreement with the recent Lemieux concept for
      antibody-carbohydrate interaction. This information facilitates a rational
      synthesis of receptor analogues for potential applications. An outline is finally
      given of an improved general approach for receptor analysis.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum's disease by fast atom
      bombardment--mass spectrometry of urine bile salts.
PG  - 221-31
AB  - A method is described for the rapid determination of urinary bile salt profiles
      by fast atom bombardment--mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). Urine was passed through a 
      reverse-phase octadecylsilane bonded silica cartridge and the bile salts eluted
      with methanol. Negative ion FAB spectra could be obtained from the equivalent of 
      10 microliter of urine loaded onto the target probe with glycerol as matrix. In
      samples from normal infants and children bile salt peaks were rarely detectable
      above the background whereas peaks produced by steroid sulphates and glucuronides
      and bile alcohol glucuronides could usually be identified. In samples from
      infants and children with cholestasis the major peaks were produced by the
      taurine and glycine conjugates of di-, tri- and tetrahydroxycholanoic acids (and 
      their monosulphates). In samples from patients with Zellweger syndrome and
      infantile Refsum's disease, a unique ion at m/z 572 indicated the presence of
      taurine-conjugated tetrahydroxy-cholestanoic acid(s). The amide linkage to
      taurine was cleaved by alkaline hydrolysis but not by cholylglycine hydrolase.
      Capillary gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the bile acids
      liberated by alkaline hydrolysis indicated the presence of at least two
      nuclear-tetrahydroxylated cholestanoic acids, probably the 6 alpha- and 1
      beta-hydroxylated derivatives of 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5
      beta-cholestan-26-oic acid.

PG  - 847-54
AB  - Monkey kidney cells (CV-1) cultivated in the presence of 0.1 mM 4-thiouridine
      (S4U) and subsequently illuminated at 365 nm exhibit a marked RNA synthesis
      inhibition. Maximal effect (approximately 40%) was obtained for a 4 h S4U
      incubation and a 45 KJ/m2 dose. Under these conditions up to 20% of total
      cellular RNA is retained at the interphase during phenol-chloroform extraction.
      The fraction of RNA crosslinked to proteins amounts to 50% of the 3H-uridine
      labeled RNA synthesized during S4U incorporation and less than 10% for the
      control samples. This strongly suggests that S4U incorporated within the RNA
      chains acts as a photoaffinity probe. The data above provide the basis of a
      method for studying in vivo RNA-protein interactions under non destructive
      conditions.

AB  - In the original HL-60 cells (HL-60-S) and an HL-60 subline (HL-60-R) respectively
      susceptible and resistant to induction of differentiation by retinoic acid or
      dimethyl sulfoxide, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine inhibited growth equally but induced
      differentiation to a greater extent in HL-60-S. Flow cytometry showed that
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine produced in both HL-60 lines an increased proportion of
      cells in G2+M rather than G0/G1 as with retinoic acid. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine may
      have a differentiation-inducing effect in HL-60 provided cells have the
      competence to differentiate, indicating the importance of an alternate mechanism 
      of action.

PG  - 591-9
AB  - A high-affinity muscarinic receptor is detectable both in normal 3T3 mouse
      fibroblasts and in their transformed counterpart obtained by transfection with
      the oncogene EJ/T24-H-ras. However, only the transformed cell line is responsive 
      to muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine in terms of Ca2+ influx and
      polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, whereas the normal cell line is unresponsive.
      Using a point-mutated p21ras protein and monoclonal antibodies anti-p21ras, we
      provide evidences that p21ras couples to receptor-operating calcium channels and 
      to polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis a muscarinic receptor which is uncoupled in
      normal mouse fibroblasts.

AB  - Myelin basic protein, one of the major membrane protein component of the central 
      nervous system, was used to probe the molecular mechanism of cellular activation.
      Pre-treatment of human neutrophils with myelin basic protein selectively inhibits
      the formyl-peptide-induced chemotaxis, without affecting chemotaxis evoked by
      casein and activated serum. Furthermore, both the degranulation and superoxide
      anion production stimulated by the chemotactic peptide are not modified by the
      prior treatment of the neutrophils with myelin basic protein.

TI  - Calcium metabolism, renin activity, and the antihypertensive effects of calcium
      channel blockade.
PG  - 6-14
AB  - Although abnormalities of calcium metabolism have been described in various
      hypertensive states, the specific manner in which these abnormalities contribute 
      to the increased pressure remains unclear. Our own group, in attempting to
      resolve the seemingly contradictory evidence thus far obtained, has adopted an
      approach emphasizing the clinical as well as biochemical heterogeneity among
      hypertensive subjects. We have observed the following: broad-based deviations of 
      calcium ionic and hormonal indices in patients with essential hypertension; these
      deviations are linked with concurrent deviations in the renin-aldosterone system.
      Thus, low-renin subjects exhibit a calcium ionic and hormonal profile suggestive 
      of calcium deficiency, whereas high-renin subjects have an opposite metabolic
      profile suggestive of calcium excess; blood pressure responses to dietary salt
      loading may also differ among renin subgroups of essential hypertension and may
      be mediated by salt-induced alterations of calcium metabolism. In the absence of 
      these alterations, dietary salt intake results in little or no change in blood
      pressure; and calcium as a dietary supplement may itself possess antihypertensive
      properties in targeted subgroups of essential hypertensive patients,
      preferentially in low-renin, lower ionized calcium subjects. Interestingly,
      calcium channel blockade also preferentially lowers pressure in low-renin, lower 
      serum ionized calcium forms of hypertension and may define those subjects whose
      elevated pressure is most dependent on extracellular calcium. Conversely, renin
      profiling or serum ionized calcium measurements may be used clinically to help
      target subjects most likely to benefit from calcium channel antagonists. Lastly, 
      unlike other antihypertensive drug classes, high salt intake does not blunt, and 
      may even enhance, the hypotensive effects of calcium channel blockade, lessening 
      the need for stringent dietary recommendations. Altogether, these heterogeneous
      alterations of calcium metabolism in essential hypertension suggest that the
      linkage between the regulation of calcium metabolism, renin system activity, and 
      blood pressure in essential hypertension is of pathophysiologic as well as
      therapeutic relevance.

TI  - Effect of lindane on eggshell characteristics and calcium level in the domestic
      duck.
PG  - 245-58
AB  - Adult laying domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were forced fed
      lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) 20 mg/kg body weight daily, thrice/week and
      twice/week for 8 weeks. Significant shell thinning (18-21%) was observed in ducks
      with daily and thrice/week lindane feeding. SEM studies of thinned eggshells
      revealed reduced and tightly clustered mammillae with apparent decrease in
      intermammillary spaces and signs of inhibition of calcite formation. Such
      structural changes of thinned shells were associated with a significant reduction
      in the level of calcium both of the plasma and of shell gland of the ducks.
      Simultaneously, density of the pore in the shell and pore area/cm2 of the shell
      in these birds were drastically reduced, presumably because of total absence of
      'large' pores in such shells. Such porosity change is suggestive of reduced
      conductivity of eggshell implying impaired hatching success. Diethyl stilboestrol
      post-treatment neutralized all the adverse effects of lindane on duck eggshell,
      indicating induced estrogen deficiency in such birds by lindane.

      abruptio placenta.
PG  - 807-15
AB  - Rapid inhibition of urokinase in plasma obtained from women in the third
      trimester of pregnancy was assessed by the addition of 75 IU urokinase per ml
      plasma, and measurement of residual urokinase activity with PyroGlu-Gly-Arg-pNA
      after 5 minutes incubation at 37 degrees C. The urokinase inhibitory capacity was
      markedly increased for the pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls.
      Alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 2-antiplasmin did not
      account for the activity. Inhibition was higher for women with multiple
      gestations or macrosomia (n = 11) compared to normal pregnant women (n = 35)
      suggesting that the placenta contributes significantly to the measured activity. 
      Inhibition was lower for women with hypertension (n = 33) compared to the normal 
      pregnant women. Although the etiology for this difference is unclear, the
      decreased inhibitory activity may contribute to the increased risk for placental 
      abruption that is observed for this group of women.

TI  - Effects of EACA on thrombin generation as measured by the chromagen S2238.
PG  - 761-9
AB  - In the presence of epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) thrombin generation in
      recalcified platelet rich plasma (PRP) was markedly stimulated, as measured by
      the cleavage of the synthetic substrate S2238. However, thrombin activity
      remaining after 30 minutes incubation was reduced when compared with control
      values. The residual activity was shown to be hirudin insensitive and to be
      associated with a species of higher molecular weight than free thrombin. These
      results suggested an inhibition of thrombin binding to the antithrombin, alpha
      2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). Preincubation of PRP with EACA reduced the
      concentration at which EACA elicited its dual effects. Similar results were
      obtained with the alpha 2M inhibitor, hydrazine. These experiments indicated that
      alpha 2M may play a more important role in regulating thrombin generation than
      has been previously recognized.

TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to the turtle cortex reveal neuronal subsets, antigenic
      cross-reactivity with the mammalian neocortex, and forebrain structures sharing a
      pallial derivation.
PG  - 330-40
AB  - The dorsal cortex of the pond turtle (Pseudemys scripta) is a relatively simple
      structure consisting of two principal classes of neurons that occupy three
      distinct layers. Morphological, pharmacological, and physiological data suggest
      many similarities to the mammalian neocortex, rendering it an interesting
      preparation for comparative studies. We prepared monoclonal antibodies to the
      turtle dorsal cortex by immunizing mice with cortical tissue from adult turtles. 
      Twelve antibodies were generated that recognize specific components of the turtle
      cortex. Among these, eight antibodies label only neurons and four label only
      ependymal glial cells. Differences in tissue staining pattern and immunoglobulin 
      class suggest a heterogeneity of antigenic specificity among the antibodies. The 
      staining patterns of three of our antibodies are described. TC3, like all other
      neuron-marking antibodies generated, labels a subset of both pyramidal and
      stellate cell types. It also cross-reacts with a subset of mammalian cortical
      neurons and labels them with a pattern similar to that observed in the turtle
      cortex. TC5 stains ependymal cells and their glial processes in the turtle
      cortex, and cross-reacts with fibrous astrocytelike processes in mammalian
      neocortical white matter. TC9 appears to recognize antigens of neurons sharing a 
      pallial derivation in turtle.

      cells during in vitro exposure to dimethylsulfoxide.
PG  - 889-99
AB  - Kinetic events associated with the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-induced inhibition of
      hepatic tumor cell proliferation were studied using established lines of murine
      liver tumor cells (BW77-2 and Hepa-1/A1) and conditions of polar solvent
      treatment (1-3% final concentration in the culture medium for a period of 4 days)
      previously shown to increase the expression of differentiated functions in BW77-2
      cells. Cell-cycle substrates of exponentially growing and DMSO-treated liver
      tumor cell populations were compared by flow cytometric techniques employing
      recently developed cytochemical criteria to identify hepatocyte cell cycle
      compartments based on individual cellular RNA and DNA contents (Higgins, 1985).
      Suppression of hepatic tumor cell proliferation by DMSO (in non-cytotoxic
      concentrations) persisted only for the duration of the exposure period.
      Resumption of cell division was readily observed following removal of the polar
      solvent from the culture medium. During DMSO treatment, BW77-2 and Hepa-1/A1
      cells accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle
      (low-population-density 3% DMSO-treated cultures were composed of 88% G1 cells
      compared to only 48% G1 DNA content cells in control cultures of similar
      population density) and exhibited a substantial shift to lower mean cellular RNA 
      content. The relatively few S- and G2 + M-phase cells in DMSO cultures also
      possessed lower RNA contents compared to the corresponding cell cycle
      compartments in exponentially growing cultures. The mean RNA contents for the G1,
      S, and G2 + M compartments of DMSO-treated cells approximated 63.8, 78.6, and
      74.4%, respectively, of the amounts observed in control cultures. Low-RNA G1
      cells in DMSO cultures expressed a continuum of RNA distributions similar in
      range variation to (but at lower mean cellular RNA content levels than) cycling
      G1 cells in log-phase growth. Thus, G1 cells in 1% DMSO-treated populations had a
      mean cellular RNA content of just 25 (arbitrary RNA) units compared to over 40
      units for G1 cells in exponential phase growth. Low RNA content, non-replicating,
      hepatic tumor cells in polar solvent-treated cultures were designated as being in
      the "Qi" substate (DMSO-induced quiescent-type cells). Release of BW77-2 cells
      from Qi, after replacement of the DMSO-containing growth medium by medium without
      the polar solvent, was characterized by an increase in mean G1 RNA content and
      recruitment into log-phase growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

      amnion cells engaged in nucleotide excision DNA repair.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - PCNA autoantibodies specific for cyclin/PCNA were used to determine the nuclear
      distribution of this protein in transformed human amnion cells (AMA) irradiated
      with ultraviolet light (254 nm) under conditions that induced nucleotide excision
      DNA repair synthesis. The results showed a striking increase in nuclear
      cyclin/PCNA antigen staining of non S-phase cells that was not abolished by
      cycloheximide (20 micrograms/ml, added 2 h before irradiation), and that is most 
      likely due to a redistribution of pre-existing cyclin. These observations raise
      the possibility that cyclin/PCNA may play a role in nucleotide excision DNA
      repair synthesis in addition to its putative role in replicative DNA synthesis.

PG  - 231-4
AB  - Purified type I topoisomerase from calf thymus as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic
      extracts from EGF-stimulated human and mouse fibroblasts in cell culture
      efficiently convert supercoiled plasmid DNA to the relaxed form. The purified IgG
      fraction from the sera of Japanese patients with the rheumatic disease
      scleroderma were shown to inhibit this relaxation activity. Thus, these patients 
      likely produce autoantibodies to topoisomerase I. In addition, the human, bovine 
      and murine enzymes share antigenic determinants recognized by the antisera.

      subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) from a lambda gt-11 cDNA
      library derived from a porcine epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1). The cDNA was
      detected by immunological screening using an affinity purified polyclonal
      antibody for bovine RII. DNA sequence analysis of the 467 bp EcoRI insert
      confirmed the identity of the clone, because the deduced amino acid sequence
      corresponded to the published sequence for the bovine RII protein. Northern
      analysis of total RNA from the LLC-PK1 cells indicated a single mRNA species of
      about 6.0 kb, probably derived from a single copy gene.

TI  - Purification, subunit structure and pharmacological effects on cardiac and smooth
      muscle cells of a polypeptide toxin isolated from the marine snail Conus
      tessulatus.
PG  - 787-92
AB  - The most active component in smooth muscle contraction, isolated from the whole
      venom of the marine snail Conus tessulatus, has a molecular mass of about 55 kDa.
      The toxin protein, tessulatus toxin, appeared to be constituted by two distinct
      polypeptide bands of 26 kDa and 29 kDa. The pure toxin caused a marked
      contraction of both guinea-pig ileum and rabbit aorta at nanomolar
      concentrations. Tessulatus-toxin-induced contraction was indirectly prevented by 
      classical inhibitors of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. Tessulatus toxin
      caused a large increase in the initial rate of 45Ca2+ uptake by cardiac cells.
      This uptake was insensitive to Ca2+ channel blockers at concentrations 100-1000
      fold higher than those known to block voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in these
      cells. Voltage clamp experiments have confirmed that tessulatus toxin was not
      directly active on the Ca2+ current. Tessulatus-toxin-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx
      was inhibited by dichlorobenzamil and suppressed when Na+ was substituted by Li+,
      indicating that the toxin acted via activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange system in
      cardiac cells. Activation by tessulatus toxin of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange system
      occurred via a toxin-stimulated Na+ entry into cardiac cells and was observed in 
      the same range of toxin concentration which produced 45Ca2+ entry. The Na+ entry 
      system that was activated by tessulatus toxin was insensitive to classic
      inhibitors of known Na+ entry systems in cardiac cells. Possible mechanisms by
      which tessulatus toxin induced Na+ entry into cardiac cells and contractions in
      smooth muscles are discussed. Tessulatus toxin is cytotoxic when used at high
      concentrations.

PG  - 603-9
AB  - The voltage-dependent calcium channel from guinea-pig skeletal muscle T-tubules
      has been isolated with a rapid, two-step purification procedure. Reversible
      postlabelling of the channel-linked 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor and
      stereoselective photolabelling as a novel approach were employed to assess
      purity. A 135-fold purification to a specific activity of 1311 +/- 194 pmol/mg
      protein (determined by reversible equilibrium binding with (+)-[3H]PN200-110) was
      achieved. Three polypeptides of 155 kDa, 65 kDa and 32 kDa were identified in the
      purified preparation. The 155-kDa band is a glycoprotein. The arylazide
      photoaffinity probe (-)-[3H]azidopine bound with high affinity to solubilized
      membranes (Kd = 0.7 +/- 0.2 nM) and highly purified fractions (Kd = 3.1 +/- 2
      nM), whereas the optical antipode (+)-azidopine was of much lower affinity.
      Irradiation of (-)-[3H]azidopine and (+)-[3H]azidopine receptor complexes with
      ultraviolet light led to preferential incorporation of the (-) enantiomer into
      the 155-kDa polypeptide in crude solubilized and purified preparations. The
      pharmacological profile of irreversible labelling of the 155-kDa glycoprotein by 
      (-)-[3H]azidopine is identical to that found in reversible binding experiments.
      Specific photolabelling of the 155-kDa band by (-)-[3H]azidopine per milligram of
      protein increases 150-fold upon purification, whereas incorporation into
      non-specific bands in the crude solubilized material is identical for both, (-)
      and (+)-[3H]azidopine.

PG  - 579-87
AB  - A study has been made, following high-resolution refinement at 0.14 nm, of the
      structure of erabutoxin b, prototype postsynaptic neurotoxin from snake venom.
      The detailed patterns of intramolecular van der Waal's interactions have been
      determined. From information, hitherto unavailable, about atomic temperature
      parameters, the relative mobilities in different regions of the molecule have
      been estimated. A detailed model of structure/function relationships in these
      neurotoxins, which bind to the acetylcholine receptor, has thus been established:
      the probable dynamic mode of toxin-receptor binding is described. The model
      identifies, and the binding mode depends on a unique structural feature of these 
      protein toxins: the hydrophobic 'Trp' cleft. Charge-charge interactions are
      implicated in initial toxin orientation on the receptor surface. Possible
      reactive-site extension in short-chain toxins is described. Modifications in
      binding mode of long-chain toxins are considered. The relative mobilities of
      antigenic site residues are discussed.

TI  - Effects of induction of rat liver cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase on the
      oxidation of biogenic aldehydes.
PG  - 4563-9
AB  - Phenobarbital and tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induce two different forms
      of aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3, ALDH), designated phi and tau
      respectively, in the rat liver cytosol. The physiological substrates for these
      enzymes are as yet unknown. In this study we investigated whether the induction
      of these enzymes forms affected the metabolism of dopamine and norepinephrine in 
      rat liver slices. A 10-fold increase in phi-ALDH produced by phenobarbital
      treatment resulted in small increases in the formation of
      3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid from the biogenic
      amines. The 50- to 100-fold elevation of the tau-isozyme did not alter the rate
      of formation of the acids. When liver slices were incubated with 40 mM ethanol,
      the formation of the reduced products of dopamine and norepinephrine,
      3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, respectively, was
      favored. Under these conditions, the induction of the phi-isoenzyme again
      produced only a small increase in the formation of the acid products, whereas the
      induction of the tau-isoenzyme had no effect on acid production from biogenic
      amine metabolism. The results suggest that neither the phi- nor the tau-forms of 
      ALDH are involved in the hepatic metabolism of dopamine or norepinephrine and
      support the conclusion that the oxidation of the aldehyde derived from dopamine
      occurs in mitochondria [A. W. Tank, H. Weiner and J. Thurman, Biochem. Pharmac.
      30, 3265 (1981)].

      recognize the viral nucleoprotein (N), but not the major glycoprotein (G),
      expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants.
PG  - 3973-7
AB  - The viral antigens recognized by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) have not been defined in
      most viruses infecting mouse or man. Natural or artificial virus recombinants can
      be used to determine the antigen specificity of CTL directed against viruses with
      segmented genomes, such as influenza, but this technique is more difficult to
      apply to the study of unsegmented viruses. We describe here the use of
      recombinant vaccinia viruses, containing cDNA corresponding to either the
      nucleoprotein (N) gene or the major surface glycoprotein (G) gene of human
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to examine the antigen specificity of anti-RSV
      cytotoxic T cells from humans and mice. The results demonstrate that the RSV N
      protein is one of the target antigens for CTL in man and mouse, whereas the G
      protein was not recognized and can at best represent a minor target antigen for
      CTL.

TI  - IgM antibodies recognizing carbohydrate epitopes shared between schistosomula and

PG  - 3946-54
AB  - A series of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was raised in mice against Schistosoma
      mansoni, which recognized a carbohydrate determinant on a major Mr greater than
      200,000 schistosomulum surface antigen. These mAb cross-reacted with the surface 
      of cercariae and miracidia and with schistosomula of S. haematobium and S. bovis.
      Other mAb were generated that only recognized a Mr 20,000 schistosomulum surface 
      antigen; they did not cross-react with eggs or miracidia and were species
      specific. The anti-Mr 20,000 mAb of the IgG1 isotype exhibited high levels of
      complement-dependent cytotoxicity to schistosomula in vitro. IgM mAb that
      recognized carbohydrate epitopes of the Mr greater than 200,000 surface antigen
      blocked the lethal activity of the anti-Mr 20,000 mAb. The IgM anti-Mr greater
      than 200,000 mAb also reduced complement-dependent cytotoxicity of serum from
      mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae.

TI  - Characterization of primate bronchoalveolar mast cells. II. Inhibition of
      histamine, LTC4, and PGD2 release from primate bronchoalveolar mast cells and a
      comparison with rat peritoneal mast cells.
PG  - 3941-5
AB  - As described in the preceding companion paper, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of
      the primate Macaca arctoides infected with the nematode Ascaris suum yields a
      population of cells containing a high proportion of mast cells (21%). Nedocromil 
      sodium, a new drug undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of reversible
      obstructive airways disease, inhibited the release of histamine, LTC4, and PGD2
      from these cells challenged with antigen (with IC30 values of 2.1 X 10(-6) M, 2.3
      X 10(-6) M, and 1.9 X 10(-6) M, respectively) and with anti-human IgE (IC30
      values of 4.7 X 10(-6) M, 1.3 X 10(-6) M, and 1.3 X 10(-6) M, respectively).
      Cromolyn sodium was essentially inactive. Histamine release from rat peritoneal
      mast cells induced by anti-rat IgE was, however, inhibited by both nedocromil
      sodium and cromolyn sodium with IC30 values of 1.1 X 10(-6) M and 5.5 X 10(-7) M,
      respectively. Both compounds induce phosphorylation of a 78,000 m.w. protein in
      the rat peritoneal mast cell in the absence of any stimulus at the same
      concentrations as those required to inhibit histamine release stimulated by
      anti-IgE. This event may be part of a feedback mechanism to limit degranulation. 
      Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium were equipotent in their ability to inhibit
      anti-IgE-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, but differed
      markedly in their ability to inhibit histamine release from macaque BAL cells.

TI  - Characterization of primate bronchoalveolar mast cells. I. IgE-dependent release 
      of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.
PG  - 3933-40
AB  - Large numbers of functional mast cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage
      (BAL) of Macaca arctoides monkeys that had been infected with the nematode
      Ascaris suum. These lavage cells, of which 21% were mast cells, released
      histamine, LTC4, and PGD2 in a concentration-dependent fashion when challenged
      with ascaris antigen or antibody to human IgE. However, there was no release of
      histamine when these cells were challenged with compound 48/80. The amount of
      mediator released was highly dependent on the sensitivity of the cells to
      immunologic challenge, but was generally in the range of 2 to 5 micrograms
      histamine (30 to 70% of total), 20 to 80 ng LTC4, and 100 to 300 ng PGD2 per
      10(6) mast cells when maximally challenged. Other eicosanoids measured were
      released only in much smaller quantities. Maximal values were 4 ng LTB4, 2 ng
      PGE2, and approximately 10 to 20 ng PGF2 alpha per 10(6) mast cells. The amount
      of LTC4 and PGD2 released correlated with the release of histamine, the
      calculated regression line indicating that 18 ng LTC4 and 50 ng PGD2 were
      released per microgram of histamine released. This correlation suggests that the 
      majority of the LTC4 and PGD2 released was probably mast cell-derived. Further
      support for this conclusion was given by the observation that when lavage cells
      were fractioned on continuous Percoll gradients, the ability to release LTC4 and 
      PGD2 on immunologic challenge coincided with the peak of mast cells.

TI  - A syngeneic monoclonal antibody to murine Meth-A sarcoma (HepSS-1) recognizes
      heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG): cell density and transformation
      dependent alteration in cell surface HS-GAG defined by HepSS-1.
PG  - 3900-8
AB  - We have isolated a syngeneic monoclonal antibody (HepSS-1) reactive to a murine
      methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, Meth-A. HepSS-1 also bound to a wide
      variety of established and fresh normal cells derived from not only mice but also
      other species such as human, monkey, rat, hamster, and chicken.
      Immunoprecipitation of surface iodinated Meth-A cell extract with HepSS-1, as
      well as Sepharose 4B gel chromatography of Meth-A cell extract and detection of
      antigens recognized by HepSS-1 by a sandwich-type radioimmunoassay revealed that 
      the HepSS-1 antigens were composed of several molecular species, with one as
      large as approximately 10(6) daltons. The following evidence indicates that
      HepSS-1 specifically recognizes an epitope present in heparan sulfate
      glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG). First, treatment of Meth-A cells with heparitinase or
      heparinase, but not with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase, resulted in the
      loss of HepSS-1 binding. Second, HS-GAG but not seven other types of GAG
      (hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin
      6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate) inhibited HepSS-1 binding to
      Meth-A cells. Third, HepSS-1 bound with HS-GAG but not with the seven other types
      of GAG. From the binding analysis of HepSS-1 to various modified HS-GAG and whale
      omega-heparin, it is additionally suggested that HepSS-1 recognizes an epitope
      closely related to O-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine. We found that NIH 3T3
      cells expressed more HepSS-1 epitopes at a low cell density than at confluency
      and in G2 + M than in G1, whereas NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Kirsten-ras
      oncogene or SV-40 expressed high levels of HepSS-1 epitopes and ceased to show
      the density-dependent change in the amount of HepSS-1 epitopes. These
      observations were also reproduced by using NIH 3T3 cells transformed with a
      temperature sensitive Kirsten murine sarcoma virus maintained at permissive and
      non-permissive temperatures. Thus HepSS-1 is a first monoclonal antibody to
      HS-GAG and seems to be useful to elucidate changes in cell surface HS-GAG in
      normal cell growth and cell transformation.

TI  - Analysis of hybrid H-2D and L antigens with reciprocally mismatched aminoterminal
      domains: functional T cell recognition requires preservation of fine structural
      determinants.
PG  - 3881-90
AB  - Studies of immune recognition of hybrid class I antigens expressed on transfected
      cells have revealed an apparent general requirement that the N(alpha 1) and
      C1(alpha 2) domains be derived from the same gene in order to preserve
      recognition by virus-specific H-2-restricted and allospecific T cells. One
      exception has been the hybrid DL antigen in which the N domain of H-2Ld has been 
      replaced by that of H-2Dd. Cells bearing this molecule serve as targets for some 
      virus and allospecific CTL. Because cells expressing the reciprocal hybrid LD (N 
      domain of H-2Dd replaced by that of H-2Ld) antigen have not been available, it
      has not been possible to evaluate whether this exception stemmed from the
      relatedness of H-2Ld and H-2Dd or whether the DL antigen fortuitously preserved
      some function of the parent molecule as a rare exception. To assess this
      question, and to evaluate the contribution of the N and C1 domains of H-2Ld and
      H-2Dd to serologic and T cell recognition, we have constructed the reciprocal
      chimeric gene pLD (the N exon of H-2Ld substituted for that of H-2Dd), introduced
      this into mouse L cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer, and analyzed the expressed
      product biochemically, serologically, and functionally. Transformant L cells
      expressing either LD or DL antigens were both reactive with a number of
      anti-H-2Ld or anti-H-2Dd N/C1-specific monoclonal antibodies, indicating the
      preservation in the hybrid molecules of determinants controlled by discrete
      domains. Mab binding was generally greater with cells expressing hybrid DL
      antigen than with those transformants expressing LD molecules. Moreover, the
      amount of beta 2M associated with DL antigens was more than that associated with 
      LD. Cells expressing hybrid DL antigens were recognized as targets by bulk and
      cloned allospecific anti-H-2Dd and anti-H-2Ld CTL, whereas cells expressing LD
      molecules were not recognized by any of the T cells tested. VSV-specific
      H-2Ld-restricted CTL failed to lyse VSV-infected targets expressing either DL or 
      LD. These results indicate that T cell reactivity of cells expressing the DL
      hybrid antigen is an exception to the observed general requirement for class I
      antigens to possess matched N and C1 domains for functional T cell recognition by
      T cells restricted to parental antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Induction of experimental allergic neuritis in the BN rat: P2 protein-specific T 
      cells overcome resistance to actively induced disease.
PG  - 3826-31
AB  - T lymphocyte lines specific for the peripheral nerve myelin protein P2 were
      selected from the lymph nodes of Brown Norway (BN) rats immunized with bovine P2 
      protein in complete Freund's adjuvant. These T cells expressed the W3/25+,
      OX8-phenotype and responded specifically to bovine P2 protein, but not to PPD or 
      bovine basic protein, in T cell proliferation assays. When injected i.v. into
      syngeneic recipients, BN P2-specific T cell lines induced both clinical and
      histologic signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), overcoming the
      resistance of this rat strain to actively induced EAN. Although the
      histopathology of the disease was indistinguishable from that seen in T
      cell-mediated EAN in the Lewis rat, disease onset was considerably later, 7 to 8 
      days after cell transfer, as opposed to 4 days in Lewis. This lag phase between
      inoculation and disease onset could not be further reduced even by raising the
      cell dose to 50 X 10(6) cells/host. The fine specificity of the T cell response
      to P2 differs between Lewis- and BN-derived T cell lines. At least one
      neuritogenic epitope for each strain was present in the cyanogen bromide-derived 
      peptide CB2 (residues 21-113), as shown by the ability of CB2-specific T cell
      lines derived from each strain to transfer EAN to the appropriate host strain.
      However, neuritogenic BN T lines fail to mount a response to the sequence 53-78
      (SP4), which encompasses an epitope that is neuritogenic for Lewis rats. These
      results demonstrate that the resistance of BN rats to actively induced EAN is not
      due to the lack of appropriate P2-specific autoreactive T cell clones in the
      normal T repertoire. Furthermore, the results suggest that two distinct epitopes 
      of P2 are responsible for EAN in Lewis and BN rats.

TI  - Monoclonal anti-DNA IgM kappa in neuropathy binds to myelin and to a
      conformational epitope formed by phosphatidic acid and gangliosides.
PG  - 3821-5
AB  - Anti-DNA antibodies that cross-react with phosphorylated epitopes of other
      cellular constituents may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. 
      An IgM monoclonal antibody from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
      and neuropathy bound to denatured DNA and immunostained myelin in peripheral
      nerve and spinal cord. The monoclonal IgM bound to ELISA microwells coated with a
      mixture of phosphatidic acid and gangliosides at serum dilutions of up to
      1/100,000, but binding to phosphatidic acid alone was observed at dilutions of
      less than 1/100 only, and there was no binding to gangliosides alone. Incubation 
      with micelles containing phosphatidic acid and gangliosides selectively absorbed 
      the monoclonal IgM and inhibited its binding to denatured DNA and to myelin.
      These observations suggest that autoantibodies may bind to conformational
      epitopes formed by two separate molecules, and that autoantibodies that
      cross-react with phosphorylated epitopes in DNA and neural tissue could be
      involved in autoimmune neurologic diseases.

TI  - Influenza virus infection induces functional alterations in peripheral blood
      lymphocytes.
PG  - 3777-81
AB  - This report describes alterations in functional responses to lectin-induced
      stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the natural killer cell (NKC) 
      activity, of college students, obtained during an outbreak of influenza
      A/Philippines/2/82(H3N2) virus infection. These results are compared with similar
      observations in college students with an acute, febrile, noninfluenzal
      respiratory illness that occurred during the same outbreak. The lymphopenia
      typical of influenza during acute illness was shown to be due to a reduction in
      both T and B cells without alteration in the CD4:CD8 ratio. In addition,
      phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A responses were reduced and NKC activity was
      increased, while pokeweed mitogen reactivity was unaltered at the time of
      admission to the study. Patients with noninfluenzal illness showed early
      polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and a similar lymphopenia. Lymphocyte functions
      were virtually unchanged during acute illness in noninfluenza patients. The
      relatively specific alterations in lymphocyte responses to lectin-induced
      stimulation in influenza patients may indicate that the peripheral T cells are
      incapable of activation via the CD3 or CD2 activation pathways. In addition,
      increased NKC activity in the periphery may be reflective of increased NKC
      activity in the lung. Influenza-infected individuals with higher NKC activity at 
      the time of admission to the study also took longer to recover. Finally, the
      early lymphopenia and the later neutropenia in the influenza-infected patient may
      represent migration of these cells from the circulation to the infected
      respiratory tract as a consequence of infection.

PG  - 3748-52
AB  - Purified splenic B cells from C57BL/6 mice were separated into high-density
      (resting) and low-density (activated) B cells. Separated B cell populations were 
      cultured at low cell densities (1 X 10(4) cells/well) with recombinant
      interleukin 1 (r-IL 1) alone or in combination with dextran sulfate (DXS) or
      anti-IgM monoclonal antibodies (alpha IgM mab), respectively, and proliferative
      responses were determined. R-IL 1 alone, as well as in synergy with alpha IgM mab
      or DXS, respectively, stimulated the growth of low-density B cells. Moreover,
      r-IL 1 and alpha IgM mab costimulated replication of high-density B cells.
      Separated B cell populations (1 X 10(5) cells/well) were cultured with r-IL 1
      alone or in combination with DXS or alpha IgM mab, respectively, and the
      generation of plaque-forming cells was determined. R-IL 1 alone, as well as in
      synergy with DXS, stimulated the differentiation of low-density B cells into
      Ig-secreting cells. These findings suggest that r-IL 1 has B cell growth and
      differentiation factor activity and is operative on high- and low-density B
      cells. Thus, IL 1 may play an important role in B cell growth and maturation.

TI  - A cascade of T-T interactions, mediated by the linked recognition of antigen, in 
      the induction of T cells able to help delayed-type hypersensitivity responses.
PG  - 3726-33
AB  - Previous work has shown that specific helper T cells are required for the primary
      induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Conditions are defined here
      under which the primary induction by antigen of precursor helper T cells only
      occurs in the presence of specific, irradiated effector T cells, demonstrating
      that the induction of helper T cells requires T-T cooperation. The interaction
      between precursor and effector helper T cells is mediated by the recognition of
      epitopes that must be physically linked to one another. In more detail,
      hapten-Ficoll conjugates and xenogeneic red blood cells induce medium-density but
      not low-density cultures of unprimed murine spleen cells to express
      antigen-specific DTH. Low-density cultures do not support the induction of DTH
      unless they are supplemented with specific irradiated helper T cells. These
      helper T cells are themselves induced when antigen is added to medium-density but
      not low-density cultures. Precursor helper T cells in low-density cultures are
      only induced by antigen in the presence of additional specific irradiated T
      cells. Further experiments were directed at analyzing the nature of this T-T
      interaction. Irradiated hapten-primed T cells help the induction of precursor
      helper T cells specific for burro red blood cells (BRBC) in the presence of
      haptenated BRBC and chicken red blood cells (CRBC), but do not help in the
      presence of haptenated CRBC and BRBC. These experiments demonstrate that the
      interaction between precursor and effector T cells is mediated by the linked
      recognition of antigen. These findings show that the induction of precursor cells
      for both DTH reactivity, and those T cells able to help in the induction of DTH, 
      require specific helper T cells. It is further shown that the induction of T
      cells able to help in the induction of helper precursor cells takes place in
      medium-density but not low-density cultures. In order words, antigen, when added 
      to medium-density cultures of normal spleen cells, induces T cells able to
      mediate DTH, and T cells able to help in the induction of these helper T cells,
      whereas antigen induces none of these T cells when added to low-density cultures 
      unless appropriate specific helper T cells are added.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against a glycoprotein localized in coated pits and
      endocytic vesicles inhibit alpha 2-macroglobulin binding and uptake.
PG  - 16732-7
AB  - Eight monoclonal antibodies, all IgG2a, which recognize a 180/90-kDa glycoprotein
      similar in properties to the receptor for alpha 2-macroglobulin of mouse embryo
      3T3 cell plasma membranes, have been tested for their effect on the binding and
      uptake of alpha 2-macroglobulin by live cells. One antibody directly inhibited
      binding of 125I-alpha 2-macroglobulin under conditions in which 125I-transferrin 
      binding to the transferrin receptor was unaffected. Another monoclonal antibody
      decreased alpha 2-macroglobulin binding when preincubated with cells at 37
      degrees C. This antibody was also capable of specifically binding to
      ligand-receptor complexes formed by preincubating 125I-alpha 2-macroglobulin with
      detergent extracts of Swiss 3T3 cells. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the 
      180/90-kDa glycoprotein was localized in coated pits of the cell surface and in
      intracellular endocytic vesicles (receptosomes/endosomes). The data suggest that 
      the 180/90-kDa glycoprotein is a component of the receptor for alpha
      2-macroglobulin.

TI  - Interaction of vitronectin with collagen.
PG  - 16698-703
AB  - Purified human plasma vitronectin was demonstrated to bind to type I collagen
      immobilized on plastic as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by
      binding of 125I-radiolabeled vitronectin to a collagen-coated plastic surface.
      Vitronectin did not bind to immobilized laminin, fibronectin, or albumin in these
      assays. Vitronectin showed similar interaction with all types of collagen (I, II,
      III, IV, V, and VI) tested. Collagen unfolded by heat treatment bound vitronectin
      less efficiently than native collagen. Vitronectin-coated colloidal gold
      particles bound to type I collagen fibrils as shown by electron microscopy. Salt 
      concentrations higher than physiological interfered with the binding of
      vitronectin to collagen, suggesting an ionic interaction between the two
      proteins. Binding studies conducted in the presence of plasma showed that
      purified vitronectin added to plasma bound to immobilized collagen, whereas the
      endogenous plasma vitronectin bound to collagen less well. Although fibronectin
      did not interfere with the binding of vitronectin to native collagen, vitronectin
      inhibited the binding of fibronectin to collagen. These results show that
      vitronectin has a collagen-binding site(s) which, unlike that of fibronectin,
      preferentially recognizes triple-helical collagen and that the binding between
      vitronectin and collagen has characteristics compatible with the occurrence of
      such an interaction in vivo.

TI  - Human pregnancy zone protein and alpha 2-macroglobulin. High-affinity binding of 
      complexes to the same receptor on fibroblasts and characterization by monoclonal 
      antibodies.
PG  - 16622-5
AB  - Pregnancy zone protein (PZP) was isolated from late pregnancy serum and examined 
      for binding to normal skin fibroblasts in culture. A high-affinity binding site
      on these cells is demonstrated for PZP reacted with methylamine. Experiments with
      alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and PZP, both modified by methylamine, showed
      this receptor to be identical to the previously characterized receptor for alpha 
      2M-proteinase complexes (Van Leuven, F., Cassiman, J.J., and Van den Berghe, H.
      (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5155-5160). With available monoclonal antibodies
      directed toward alpha 2M and prepared toward PZP, only a limited cross-reaction
      was observed. We obtained a monoclonal antibody which defines a neo-antigenic
      site on PZP-methylamine, completely analogous to the monoclonal antibody F2B2,
      which was previously shown to define a neo-antigenic site on alpha 2M complexes
      (Marynen, P., Van Leuven, F., Cassiman, J.J., and Van den Berghe, H. (1981) J.
      Immunol. 127, 1782-1786). These results provide evidence for the homologous
      function of alpha 2M and PZP as proteinase scavengers. The need for an extra
      proteinase inhibitor of the alpha 2M-type in pregnancy is discussed. The
      monoclonal antibodies now available will prove helpful in quantitation and
      eventually isolation of proteinase complexes of alpha 2M and PZP.

TI  - New molecular forms of cholecystokinin. Microsequence analysis of forms
      previously characterized by chromatographic methods.
PG  - 16392-7
AB  - Cholecystokinin previously has been characterized by chromatographic and
      immunological techniques. Analysis of cDNA has revealed the structure of
      preprocholecystokinin. The predicted processing sites of preprocholecystokinin
      cannot account for the multiple forms of cholecystokinin detected. This report
      details the isolation and characterization of cholecystokinin peptides containing
      58, 39, 33, 25, 18, 8, 7, and 5 amino acids. None of the cleavages that occurred 
      to form these peptides was at the carboxyl side of double basic residues.
      Cholecystokinin 25, 18, and 7 have not previously been isolated and identified by
      sequence analysis. The processing that forms these peptides includes cleavage
      after single basic residues for the 58, 39, 33, and 8 amino acid peptides. The
      25, 18, 7, and 5 amino acid peptides must be formed by other endopeptidases or
      combinations of endo- and exopeptidases. The analysis of this series of peptides 
      provides the chemical basis for structural differences in cholecystokinin
      molecules previously demonstrated by chromatographic and immunological methods.
      These structures provide insight into tissue-specific processing that occurs for 
      this important regulatory peptide in intestine and brain.

TI  - Treatment of advanced stage mycosis fungoides with bleomycin, doxorubicin, and
      methotrexate with topical nitrogen mustard (BAM-M).
PG  - 2611-6
AB  - Ten patients with advanced stage (TNM IIB-IVB) mycosis fungoides were treated
      with a combination chemotherapy program consisting of bleomycin and methotrexate 
      weekly, doxorubicin every 3 weeks, and topical nitrogen mustard daily (BAM-M).
      Seven patients obtained histologically documented complete remissions ranging
      from 4 to 105+ months in duration. Median survival is 16.5+ months. Three
      patients in whom splenomegaly was detected during their staging evaluation
      underwent splenectomy. These three patients have had unmaintained disease-free
      survivals of 36+, 100+, and 105+ months. This study indicates that BAM-M is
      effective therapy for advanced stage mycosis fungoides and suggests that the
      therapeutic role of splenectomy should be evaluated further.

TI  - Chemotherapeutic complete remission in patients with metastatic ovarian
      dysgerminoma. Potential for cure and preservation of reproductive capacity.
PG  - 2594-9
AB  - Two patients with metastatic dysgerminoma of the ovary were treated with a
      combination of etoposide, bleomycin, and cisplatin at The University of Texas
      M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston. Both patients achieved a
      complete remission. Patient 1 developed a massive recurrence in the para-aortic
      lymph nodes 21 months after diagnosis and treatment with right
      salpingo-oophorectomy alone. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and is free
      of disease 21 months from the start of chemotherapy. Patient 2 had Stage III
      dysgerminoma and a lymphangiogram positive for tumor in the para-aortic lymph
      nodes. After surgery she received three cycles of chemotherapy and is free of
      disease 20 months from the start of chemotherapy. Both complete remissions were
      documented with second-look laparotomy. Chemotherapy may be an alternative to
      radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic dysgerminoma and should also be
      considered for selected patients with Stage I disease. A literature review
      further supports the conclusion that additional clinical trials might expand the 
      indications for chemotherapy in patients with this disease.

TI  - Use of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of copper poisoning in sheep.
PG  - 596-8
AB  - Intravenous administration of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (three doses on
      alternate days) appeared to be an effective means of containing the acute phase
      of copper toxicity in sheep, whether this arose from continuous ingestion of high
      copper feeds or by injudicious use of copper preparations for the control of
      copper deficiency. No adverse effects were recorded on lamb numbers, birth weight
      or survival of lambs born to ewes of normal to low copper status when the
      treatment was applied at sensitive periods of the reproductive cycle. Decreases
      in 'available' plasma copper and in liver damage occurred rapidly in response to 
      intravenous tetrathiomolybdate and it is suggested that all animals at risk be
      treated.

TI  - An investigation of bovine serum copper levels in Lincolnshire and South
      Humberside.
PG  - 593-5
AB  - Analysis of more than 2000 bovine serum samples showed a large monthly variation 
      in copper levels. There was also a difference in levels between beef and dairy
      cows although all showed the same monthly pattern. This monthly variation was
      correlated with rainfall; the higher the rainfall the lower the copper level. The
      interpretation of single herd blood copper values must be considered carefully in
      view of this variation.

TI  - [Paget's disease of bone treated per os with APD in 5 days].
PG  - 1787-9
AB  - Amino-hydroxy-propylidene bisphosphonic acid (APD) is a potent inhibitor of bone 
      resorption. Its oral use in Paget's disease of bone has proved effective and safe
      when the drug is administered on a long-term basis. Since APD was found not to
      impair bone mineralization, it was assumed that a long remission would be
      obtained by administering a high dose of the compound over a very short period of
      time. Therefore, 12 patients with symptomatic Paget's disease received 1200 mg/d 
      APD orally over 5 consecutive days. Follow-up is 2 months for all patients, 6
      months for 6 patients and one year for one patient. Clinical improvement and
      biochemical remission were observed in all patients. Side effects were negligible
      (transient nausea in 2 patients and +1 degree C temperature increment noted for 2
      days in 3 patients). Urinary hydroxyproline started decreasing within 2 days and 
      became normal as a mean (+/- SEM) after 5 days (1.9 +/- 0.3 mumol/lGF, nl less
      than 2.3) and in all cases after 15 days. Thereafter it remained within the
      normal range (1.9 +/- 0.2 mumol/lGF) for 6 months. Plasma alkaline phosphatase
      activity fell progressively and significantly, and became normal after 1-3 months
      in all patients but one, a man with very active disease in whom the parameter
      remained slightly above normal and stable. At the end of the sixth month, mean
      plasma alkaline phosphatase activity was 100 +/- 13 U/l (nl less than 120 U/l).
      Plasma calcium and phosphate fell transiently between days 4 and 15.(ABSTRACT

TI  - [Pyridoxine can normalize oxaluria in idiopathic renal lithiasis].
PG  - 1783-6
AB  - Pyridoxine (vitamin B6), given to patients with primary hyperoxaluria of type I, 
      generally leads to a decrease in urinary excretion of oxalate owing to
      stimulation of conversion of glyoxylate to glycine instead of oxalate. It is not 
      known, however, whether pyridoxine would equally influence hyperoxalurias of
      other origins, e.g. idiopathic or enteric. Two groups of patients were therefore 
      given pyridoxine orally for 2 months (300 mg/d). Group 1 consisted of 10
      idiopathic stone formers with mild hyperoxaluria of unknown origin. Group 2
      consisted of 4 patients with enteric hyperoxaluria after intestinal bypass
      surgery. As a mean, enteric hyperoxaluria was not influenced by vitamin B6, which
      suggests that this disorder is the consequence of intestinal hyperabsorption of
      oxalate rather than of glyoxylate. In contrast, idiopathic hyperoxaluria was
      influenced by vitamin B6: urinary excretion of oxalate decreased in 8 patients
      out of 10 and became normal in 7. However, two patients did not respond to
      pyridoxine; both had concomitant severe hyperuricosuria (greater than 1 g/24 h), 
      an observation suggesting that in these cases hyperoxaluria was of dietary
      origin. Four of the patients whose urinary excretion of oxalate became normal
      while on pyridoxine were followed up for 8 to 36 months after treatment: in all
      of them oxaluria remained normal. One whose oxaluria had returned to the upper
      normal limit was retreated after 2 years and again displayed a fall in urinary
      oxalate. It is concluded that pyridoxine given to idiopathic hyperoxalurics may
      correct the disorder, as in primary hyperoxaluria of type I; this is not the case
      in enteric hyperoxaluria. The mechanisms governing this sensitivity to vitamin B6
      remain to be clarified.

AB  - Purified lymphocyte and monocyte populations were obtained from peripheral blood 
      cells by ficoll-hypaque gradient and elutriation in different normal individuals.
      The two types of mononuclear cells were then analyzed by 2-dimensional gel
      electrophoresis. More than 1,000 spots were detected by our computer system and
      analyzed for each cell type. Automatic picture comparison showed a typical
      pattern for the two different populations with excellent reproducibility.

TI  - [Hypocalcemia and myelofibrosis: an unrecognized association].
PG  - 1771-3
AB  - Observation of a case of myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia of liver and
      spleen associated with hypocalcemia led us to investigate whether this
      association was fortuitous. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 30 patients
      with myelofibrosis and identified 9 patients with hypocalcemia out of 22 in whom 
      the plasma calcium level corrected for serum protein could be obtained, i.e. a
      prevalence of hypocalcemia of 41%. The spleen was significantly larger in the
      patients with hypocalcemia than in those with normal plasma calcium level,
      suggesting that hypocalcemia was related to the duration of the disease. In 5
      patients with hypocalcemia, biological and/or morphological evidence of
      osteomalacia was found. It is concluded that an association exists between
      myelofibrosis and hypocalcemia, possibly as a consequence of a disturbed vitamin 
      D metabolism.

PG  - 1767-70
AB  - 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25[OH]2D3) is the most important active
      metabolite of vitamin D3 and has a remarkable antiproliferative effect on
      megakaryocytes in vitro. It may have a favorable influence on collagen formation 
      and degradation by a megakaryocyte/monocyte dependent modulation. We evaluated
      the clinical effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 in four patients suffering from idiopathic
      myelofibrosis. The daily dose ranged from 0.006 to 0.016 microgram/kg. One
      patient died from asthenia 2.5 months after starting treatment and three were
      observed for more than a year. Despite treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, they all
      needed regular transfusions. During follow-up bone marrow biopsies did not reveal
      a decrease in fibrosis.

      of the erythrocyte damage].
PG  - 1763-6
AB  - A 36-year-old patient with chronic active hepatitis developed Coombs direct
      positive acute hemolytic anemia 2 weeks after a second course of cyanidanol (Cy).
      The patient's serum agglutinated control 0 Rh- erythrocytes only in the presence 
      of Cy. Human anti-globulin test showed that the red cells were covered with IgG
      as well as C3 and C4. Control erythrocytes previously treated with Cy were also
      agglutinated by the patient's serum (dilution 1:64). Upon addition to the serum
      of Cy (concentration up to 10 micrograms/ml), the agglutination was enhanced up
      to a serum dilution of 1:256. Further increase of the Cy concentration (greater
      than 10 micrograms/ml) was followed by a decreased reaction. These results
      indicate that red cell damage in this patient was mediated by both mechanisms,
      i.e. with immune complexes acting on "normal" red cells and also with antibodies 
      acting on cyanidanol-coated red cells.

TI  - An assessment of the preregistration year experience.
PG  - 1559
AB  - All 115 graduates qualifying at Liverpool University Medical School in one year
      were sent a questionnaire in the final week of their preregistration year to
      assess the experience they had gained. Of the 105 graduates (92%) who replied, 99
      (94%) considered the supervision that they had received to be adequate, 89 (85%) 
      received most of their teaching from other junior doctors, and only 47 believed
      that they had learnt a considerable amount from their consultant colleagues. Half
      of the doctors received little or no training in terminal care. Although 100
      (95%) felt competent in dealing with various medical emergencies, cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation skills were less developed; only 71 (68%) were confident in using a
      defibrillator, and 37 (35%) considered themselves to be competent in dealing with
      cardiac arrhythmias. A fifth of the doctors found interviewing relatives
      stressful. Of the 105 doctors who replied, 77 (73%) thought that their
      preregistration experience had had little or no effect on their choice of career.

TI  - Patient load and medical staffing in adult dialysis units in the United Kingdom.
PG  - 1545-8
AB  - A survey of medical staffing in 50 adult dialysis units in the United Kingdom in 
      1986 showed a wide range of patient to staff ratios or staffing score ratios. The
      total patient load (patients receiving haemodialysis in hospital and at home and 
      those receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) varied from 12 to 270 
      per unit. Patients receiving acute haemodialysis or who had received a transplant
      were not included. The unit staffing score, on a weighted scale based on
      experience, varied from 6.0 to 40.5. Previous surveys have all been regionally or
      nationally based so criteria for assessing the adequacy of staffing in single
      units do not exist. This survey attempts to provide a guideline by describing the
      range of medical staffing compared with patient load in single dialysis units. No
      unit considered itself to be overstaffed, and several considered themselves to be
      greatly understaffed. Individual dialysis units should plead their own case in
      the light of their own circumstances and up to date information provided in
      nationwide staffing surveys such as this one.

TI  - Role of vagal neuropathy in the hyponatraemia of alcoholic cirrhosis.
PG  - 1534-6
AB  - The hyponatraemia common in decompensated cirrhosis arises in part from secretion
      of antidiuretic hormone attributed to a decrease in effective blood volume.
      Baroreceptors send inhibitory impulses to the midbrain and hypothalamus through
      the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Since vagal neuropathy often occurs in
      chronic alcoholism, this might theoretically contribute to the inappropriate
      secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which might in turn induce hyponatraemia. In a
      prospective study including 34 patients with cirrhosis a high incidence of vagal 
      neuropathy was found in the alcoholics (64%) and a clear cut increase in the
      incidence of hyponatraemia in patients with evidence of vagal damage and ascites 
      (seven of eight patients (88%); p = 0.02). Results of a retrospective study of 64
      patients with cirrhosis and ascitic decompensation showed hyponatraemia in 17
      (50%) of 34 alcoholics but in only four (13%) of 30 patients with non-alcoholic
      disease (p = 0.006). Vagal neuropathy in alcoholic cirrhosis may contribute to
      the low serum sodium concentrations commonly found in these patients.

TI  - Chemoprophylaxis with oral amoxycillin against bacterial endocarditis: when
      should second doses be administered after dentistry?
PG  - 1532-4
AB  - The adequacy of serum bactericidal activity after oral amoxycillin given as
      prophylaxis against infective endocarditis was studied using a double blind
      randomised protocol in healthy volunteers having dentistry. One hour before their
      procedure 38 patients received 3 g amoxycillin syrup and 12 received matching
      placebo. Venous blood samples were drawn before and one and nine hours after
      dosing and serum amoxycillin concentrations determined using a standard bioassay.
      Samples containing amoxycillin had inhibitory titres measured against two
      reference isolates of viridans streptococci known to have caused infective
      endocarditis. The susceptibility to amoxycillin of one strain was high and the
      other low, respective minimal bactericidal and inhibitory concentrations being
      0.08 and 0.04 mumol/l (0.03 and 0.015 microgram/ml) and 2.74 and 1.37 mumol/l (1 
      and 0.5 microgram/ml). Amoxycillin was detected in only post-treatment samples of
      patients given the active drug. There were no significant correlations between
      one or nine hour drug concentrations and age or physical characteristics, nor was
      there any relation to preceding food consumption. Correlations between drug
      concentrations at one and nine hours were weak (r = 0.34; p less than 0.05), but 
      between corresponding drug concentrations and serum inhibitory titres there were 
      consistent correlations (r = 0.46-0.48; p less than 0.005). Against the low
      susceptibility reference isolate bactericidal amoxycillin concentrations were
      encountered in only 20 of the 38 nine hour samples (95% confidence limits 34% and
      66%). When repeat doses of amoxycillin are indicated after dentistry they should 
      be given about four hours later, not eight hours later as commonly practised.

TI  - Oral acyclovir in acute herpes zoster.
PG  - 1529-32
AB  - Oral acyclovir at a dose of 800 mg five times daily for seven days was compared
      with placebo in a randomised double blind trial conducted at three centres in the
      United Kingdom. The study group comprised 205 elderly immune competent patients
      suffering from herpes zoster who were entered within 72 hours of the onset of
      rash. Acyclovir significantly reduced the times to arrest of new lesion formation
      (p = 0.005), loss of vesicles (p less than 0.001), and full crusting (p = 0.02)
      in those patients entered within 48 hours of the onset of rash. In addition,
      there was a significant reduction in pain during treatment with acyclovir as
      compared with placebo (p = 0.008). Of the patients with severe pain on entry, 40%
      (10/25) of those treated with acyclovir had no or only mild pain at the end of
      treatment, whereas in the placebo group all had residual moderate or severe pain 
      (p less than 0.001). No clinically important adverse effects of acyclovir were
      reported. Oral acyclovir may modify acute herpes zoster and reduce pain.

TI  - Cough response to citric acid aerosol in occasional smokers.
PG  - 1528
AB  - Twenty two normal women volunteers underwent a standard cough provocation test by
      inhaling solutions of citric acid of progressively increasing concentration.
      Eight were non-smokers, eight moderate smokers, and six occasional smokers. All
      the non-smokers and moderate smokers coughed. Moderate smokers tended to cough
      more than non-smokers, but not significantly so. None of the occasional smokers
      coughed at all (p less than 0.001). Possibly the ability to smoke occasionally
      with enjoyment is a marker for a diminished cough reflex.

TI  - Imaging thrombus with radiolabelled monoclonal antibody to platelets.
PG  - 1525-7
AB  - Indium-111-hydroxyquinoline labelled platelets, though useful in the detection of
      thrombus, have not gained widespread use owing to the time and technical skill
      required for their preparation. A study was therefore conducted evaluating a new 
      method of imaging thrombus with platelets radiolabelled with a 111In labelled
      monoclonal antibody, P256, directed to the platelet surface glycoprotein complex 
      IIb/IIIa. When the number of receptors occupied by P256 was less than 3% of the
      total available on the platelet surface platelet function, as assessed by
      platelet aggregometry, was undisturbed. P256 was radiolabelled with 111In using
      diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, which achieved a specific activity of 185
      MBq (5 mCi)/mg. No impairment of immunoreactivity was detected at this specific
      activity. Platelets were labelled with radiolabelled monoclonal antibody in vitro
      in two patients at a receptor occupancy of 6% and in vivo--that is, by direct
      intravenous injection of P256--in six patients at a receptor occupancy of 1%. In 
      vivo recovery and biodistribution kinetics suggested that after in vitro
      labelling platelets were minimally activated. The 111In kinetics recorded after
      intravenous P256 suggested rapid and efficient radiolabelling of platelets and
      gave no indication of platelet activation. Of the six patients who received
      intravenous P256, three had documented thrombus, two of whom gave positive
      results on P256 platelet scintigraphy. The third subject had chronic deep venous 
      thrombosis and was scintigraphically negative. Imaging thrombus using a
      radiolabelled monoclonal antibody directed to platelets appears to offer great
      potential as a simple, non-invasive approach to the diagnosis of thrombosis.

      natural induction of puberty in a 20-year-old boy].
PG  - 1776-9
AB  - Successful induction of puberty by means of a pulsatile long-term therapy with
      GnRH--the variant closest to nature--can be performed on an outpatient basis
      without changing habits and lifestyle, as was demonstrated clinically and
      biochemically in a 20-year-old previously untreated boy with hypothalamic
      hypogonadism of unknown etiology. Unusual in this patient's course was the
      slow--and modest--increase in plasma FSH levels. Evidence that puberty did not
      occur spontaneously but was in fact due to treatment was gained from gonadotropin
      profiling by night and day before and after therapy withdrawal.

TI  - [Intestinal absorption of calcium gluconate and oseine-mineral complex: an
      evaluation by conventional analyses].
PG  - 1780-3
AB  - Calcium (Ca) preparations are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis,
      usually as soluble salts. Tolerance might be improved by prescription of slowly
      dissolved Ca preparations, since Ca is also absorbed distally, even in the colon.
      In this regard the use of natural forms of Ca might be advantageous, but natural 
      products cannot be labeled reliably for easy evaluation of their absorption. To
      study the intestinal absorption of an osseino-mineral complex (Ossopan) in
      comparison with Ca-gluconate, healthy males were investigated by means of
      conventional blood and urinary measurements before and after ingestion of either 
      substance containing 1.58 g Ca. All subjects were placed on a standard diet 2
      days before and during test day. Ca-gluconate (n = 7) evoked a marked and
      transient rise in plasma ionized calcium; total plasma calcium and urinary
      calcium followed a parallel course, while plasma and urinary phosphate decreased.
      After administration of osseino-mineral complex (n = 6), a slow but sustained
      elevation of plasma ionized calcium was observed while total calcium remained
      unchanged when corrected by the plasma proteins. Plasma phosphate and proteins
      increased, as did urinary phosphate. Comparing the 24-hour urine of the test day 
      with that of the previous day, the rise in calcium excretion was slightly greater
      in the subjects treated by osseino-mineral complex than in those who were given
      Ca-gluconate, while phosphate excretion increased in the first group and
      decreased in the second. It is concluded that the bioavailability of Ca in
      osseino-mineral complex is as good as, if not better than, that of
      Ca-gluconate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Vascular malformations of the colon. A frequently undetected etiology of lower
      digestive hemorrhage].
PG  - 2204-7
AB  - Angiectasia of the right colon is a new entity which must be considered in cases 
      of lower intestinal haemorrhage. Moore's classification is the one that is
      generally accepted today; it distinguishes between 3 types the most interesting
      and best individualized of which is type I. It consists of acquired lesions
      occurring after the age of 60, often multiple, localized in the right colon and
      frequently associated with aortic stenosis and atheroma. The diagnosis of these
      vascular malformations is usually delayed because the lesions are submucosal and 
      not visible at endoscopy. Bimesaraic arteriography may show typical images where 
      extravasation of contrast medium is associated with vascular tuft or "tuff". Even
      the anatomicopathological confirmation of the diagnosis is difficult, since the
      lesion can only be located by special techniques, such as intra-arterial
      injection of a silicone-containing substance. Owing to the failure of modern
      techniques such as embolization, the only possible treatment is surgical, based
      on resection of the colonic segment involved.

      cases].
PG  - 2201-3
AB  - Peripancreatic tuberculous lymphadenitis is rare and of difficult diagnosis. The 
      two cases described illustrate two clinical aspects according to the proximity of
      the biliary tract: either anterior lymph nodes responsible for obstructive
      jaundice, or posterior lymph nodes responsible for chronic epigastric pain.
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is essential to exclude a
      pancreatic lesion and facilitate the interpretation of the CT images.
      Tuberculosis must then be suspected. In the absence of another tuberculous
      localisation, laparotomy is necessary to assert the diagnosis. Antituberculous
      chemotherapy alone, administered for 9 to 12 months, cures this form of
      tuberculous lymphadenitis.

AB  - Three cases of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (SFNN) are presented.
      They occurred after a therapeutic coma induced by intravenous barbiturates to
      control convulsions unresponsive to conventional treatment. Two patients had
      widespread lesions. Histopathology showed prominent vascular involvement. Since
      1970, 26 cases of SFNN have been published. Among the aetiological factors
      already described, hypothermia and ischaemia play a major role. It is suggested
      that brown adipose tissue might be of importance in the pathophysiology of
      subdural fat necrosis of the newborn.

PG  - 2191-5
AB  - Sixty patients with aortic arch aneurysm have been operated upon at the Foch
      Medico-Surgical Centre between 1964 and 1984. This period can be subdivided into:
      January, 1964 to December, 1975 (24 cases) and January, 1976 to April, 1984 (36
      cases). The technique used (closure by patch or segmental replacement prosthesis)
      depended on the type of lesion encountered. In most cases, the cardiopulmonary
      bypass was between the femoral artery and the right atrium. After experimenting
      with different methods, we now protect the brain by selective cold blood carotid 
      perfusion, using independent circuit and heat-exchanger. Operative mortality was 
      12% in series I (1964-1975) and 0% in series II (1975-1984) patients. Hospital
      mortality was 25% in series I and 13% in series II patients. The improvements
      obtained during the last few years, using cold blood carotid perfusion and
      circulatory arrest in the lower half of the body, have made it possible to
      perform open distal anastomoses. This method ensures excellent brain protection
      and short cardiopulmonary bypass period.

OID - KIE: 23912
OAB - KIE: A member of a medical center fetal treatment program and division of
      pediatric surgery discusses the technical feasibility and unique suitability of
      fetal tissue and organ transplants for treatment of diseases and congenital
      defects in children. He argues that anencephalic fetuses would be ideal donors.
      Although some maintain that the anencephalic newborn is incapable of achieving
      personhood because it lacks the forebrain necessary for characteristic human
      activity, Harrison rejects using this claim because of the controversy concerning
      personhood, the potential for lack of respect for the fetus and its parents, and 
      the possibility that less severely handicapped fetuses might be denied
      personhood. He proposes that the anencephalic fetus be considered a dying person 
      because of clearly definable brain absence, and that such a fetus be recognized
      as brain dead for medicolegal purposes. The family could then be approached
      concerning donation.

TI  - Medical admissions in men: the risk among drinkers.
PG  - 1380-3
AB  - Information on alcohol consumption was elicited by the same method from men in a 
      general population survey and from male medical inpatients in a hospital serving 
      that population. A measure of risk controlling for age, the logarithm of the odds
      ratio, showed that for liver disorders, upper gastrointestinal disorders,
      myocardial infarction, other cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory disorders,
      rising consumption of alcohol was related to increased risk of hospital admission
      relative to abstention. The risk of admission for the remaining heterogeneous
      category of disorders was lower than that for abstention, perhaps reflecting the 
      effect of chronic illness on drinking habits, and also suggesting that the link
      between alcohol consumption and medical diagnoses is not simply due to greater
      frankness about drinking in hospital inpatients.

TI  - Giving up smoking and the risk of heart attacks. A report from The British
      Regional Heart Study.
PG  - 1376-80
AB  - In a prospective study of 7735 middle-aged men, both current and
      ex-cigarette-smokers had a risk of a major IHD event, within an average 6.2 years
      of screening, more than twice that in men who had never smoked cigarettes; men
      who had given up smoking more than 20 years ago still had an increased risk. This
      excess risk among ex-smokers is only to a small extent explained by their higher 
      blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, and body-mass index. An increased
      prevalence of IHD in men who had recently given up smoking also made a small
      contribution to excess risk. In both current and former cigarette smokers, the
      number of years a man had smoked cigarettes ("smoking-years") was the clearest
      indicator of IHD risk due to cigarettes. The major benefit of giving up smoking
      may lie in halting the accumulation of smoking years.

PG  - 1366-7
AB  - 302 women aged 16-80 without symptoms of spinal disease had their lumbar
      intervertebral discs examined by magnetic resonance. The prevalence of one or
      more degenerate discs increased linearly with age but disc degeneration was
      already present in over one-third of women aged 21-40; these young women may
      prove to be at special risk of disc prolapse later in life. The high prevalence
      of symptomless disc degeneration must be taken into account when magnetic
      resonance is used for assessment of spinal symptoms.

PG  - 1364-5
AB  - In a study of serum levels of endogenous tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in healthy 
      people and patients with neoplastic or infectious disease, only patients with
      kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis) and malaria were found to have a strikingly
      increased frequency of raised TNF levels (66.6% and 70.0%, respectively). 7.9% of
      samples from both healthy subjects and patients with neoplastic disease contained
      measurable TNF. The discovery of elevated TNF levels in the sera of patients with
      parasitic diseases suggests that this cytokine may play a part in host defences
      against parasitic infections.

TI  - Cardiac pumping capability and prognosis in heart failure.
PG  - 1360-3
AB  - In 63 patients with severe acute or chronic heart failure maximum cardiac
      performance was determined by calculation of the maximum hydraulic power output
      achieved by the heart during dobutamine challenge. After one year, all but 3 of
      the 23 patients with maximum cardiac power output (Wmax) less than the normal
      resting value of 1 W had died of progressive heart failure. Of the 40 with Wmax
      more than 1 W, all but 4 (who died suddenly) survived longer than one year.
      Hydraulic power output is a clinically important measure of cardiac pumping
      performance and a maximum power output value below the normal resting value
      indicates that long-term survival is unlikely.

TI  - Suicide attempts in hypo-oestrogenic phases of the menstrual cycle.
PG  - 1357-60
AB  - The phase of the menstrual cycle in women who had attempted suicide was
      determined by structured interview. 108 young women were investigated within 24 h
      of the attempt. Patients were grouped according to menstrual week and whether
      they used oral contraception (OC) (n = 73) or not (n = 35). In OC non-users
      suicide attempts were associated with low plasma oestradiol: they tended to
      happen during the first week of the menstrual cycle (42%) and after the fourth
      week (12%). Frequency of suicide attempts did not vary significantly during the
      menstrual cycle in OC users. In OC non-users, low oestradiol production may
      predispose to depression and attempted suicide.

TI  - Coronary artery bypass graft failure--an autoimmune phenomenon?
PG  - 1353-7
AB  - Plasma anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) was measured in 83 patients having coronary
      artery bypass graft surgery and results were correlated with the incidence of
      early (1-2 weeks) and late (12 months) graft occlusion, as judged by angiography.
      There was an association between preoperative ACA level and the incidence of late
      graft occlusion in relation to both number of patients with an occlusion and
      number of distal anastomoses occluded. 8 of 15 patients (53.3%) whose maximum ACA
      level exceeded 4 SD of the mean of controls had a late graft occlusion. When the 
      ACA titre was 2-4, 0-2, or less than 0 SD above the mean of the controls, the
      occlusion rates were 3 of 13 (23.1%), 3 of 33 (9.1%), and 1 of 15 (6.7%),
      respectively (p less than 0.03). The incidence of a postoperative rise in ACA
      level was higher in patients who had had a myocardial infarction in the past than
      in those with a history of angina only (chi 2 = 4.08, p less than 0.05). This
      observation supports the notion that one mechanism of ACA production is an immune
      response to myocardial injury. These results raise the further possibility that
      the ACA, or related antiphospholipid antibodies, may play a part in progressive
      coronary vessel disease.

TI  - Islet-cell antibodies and insulin autoantibodies in association with common viral
      infections.
PG  - 1351-3
AB  - The appearance of islet-cell antibodies (ICA) and insulin autoantibodies (IAA)
      was sought in a prospective study of subjects with acute infections (mumps,
      rubella, chickenpox, and measles) followed for 6 months. IAA appeared in many
      patients' serum samples after these acute infections, IgM-IAA being more
      prevalent than IgG-IAA; there was a particularly high incidence (81%) after
      chickenpox. ICA were detected in 2 subjects--in 1 after rubella and in the other 
      after measles, but this patient had evidence of previous rubella and a strong
      autoimmune family history. ICA did not appear after mumps. It is postulated that 
      viral infections may trigger the production of IgM-IAA by a common mechanism
      involving polyclonal immunocyte activation.

TI  - The color of the surface of venus.
PG  - 1379-83
AB  - Multispectral images of the basaltic surface of Venus obtained by Venera 13 were 
      processed to remove the effects of orange-colored incident radiation resulting
      from interactions with the thick Venusian atmosphere. At visible wavelengths the 
      surface of Venus appears dark and without significant color. High-temperature
      laboratory reflectance spectra of basaltic materials indicate that these results 
      are consistent with mineral assemblages bearing either ferric or ferrous iron. A 
      high reflectance in the near-infrared region observed at neighboring Venera 9 and
      10 sites, however, suggests that the basaltic surface material contains ferric
      minerals and thus may be relatively oxidized.

TI  - Randomly exact methods.
PG  - 1356-60
AB  - Important advances in the understanding of "random" processes have produced a
      variety of stochastic algorithms that offer unprecedented scope and utility in
      the study of physical systems. These algorithms represent a departure from the
      usual philosophy inherent in the study of many-body problems and have a number of
      significant features. Chief among these features are simplicity, weak dependence 
      on dimensionality, and ease of transition between classical and
      quantum-mechanical descriptions. These methods are also readily adapted for use
      on massively paraliel computer architectures. These new stochastic methods
      represent a valuable addition to the tools available for the analysis of both
      equilibrium and time-dependent many-body problems.

      atmosphere.
PG  - 1383-5
AB  - The possible consequences of very high carbon dioxide concentrations in the
      earth's early atmosphere have been investigated with a radiative-convective
      climate model. The early atmosphere would apparently have been stable against the
      onset of a runaway greenhouse (that is, the complete evaporation of the oceans)
      for carbon dioxide pressures up to at least 100 bars. A 10- to 20-bar carbon
      dioxide atmosphere, such as may have existed during the first several hundred
      million years of the earth's history, would have had a surface temperature of
      approximately 85 degrees to 110 degrees C. The early stratosphere should have
      been dry, thereby precluding the possibility of an oxygenic prebiotic atmosphere 
      caused by photodissociation of water vapor followed by escape of hydrogen to
      space. Earth's present atmosphere also appears to be stable against a carbon
      dioxide-induced runaway greenhouse.

TI  - Toxicologic and pharmacokinetic evaluation of a case of vancomycin intoxication
      during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 293-7
AB  - The use of vancomycin is rapidly increasing due to the emergence of strains of
      staphylococci resistant to betalactam antibiotics. In this communication the
      pharmacokinetics of an overdose of vancomycin in a patient during continuous
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is reported. Brainstem auditory evoked
      potentials (BAEPs) are used to assess ototoxicity. It could be shown that by
      shortening the dwell time, the apparent CAPD flow was increased and the
      vancomycin clearance was also increased. This may explain in part the differences
      in the values of vancomycin t1/2 in this patient (21 h) as compared to other
      studies (60-120 h). The age of the patient (3.5 years) may also have influenced
      the t1/2. Using brainstem auditory evoked potentials as a parameter to assess
      ototoxicity, it was shown that this patient suffered no damage from the overdose.

TI  - Screening for antimicrobial activity of some essential oils by the agar overlay
      technique.
PG  - 289-92
AB  - Fifty-three essential oils were tested against five micro-organisms (Bacillus
      subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Candida albicans) using the agar overlay technique. The essential oils were
      randomly selected and not on the basis of a supposed activity. It was found that 
      all oils showed an activity against at least one micro-organism, and that
      substantial activities against P. aeruginosa were scarce. Combined activities
      against C. albicans, the Gram-positive bacteria and E. coli, and an activity
      against C. albicans were most often observed. Secondly a combined activity
      against C. albicans, B. subtilis and S. aureus was found. The differences between
      the inhibition zones were too small for a differentiation of the antimicrobial
      activities of the essential oils. A correlation matrix shows the relationships of
      the micro-organisms as to the activity patterns of the essential oils. High
      correlations were found for all the micro-organisms, except for P. aeruginosa.

      in rats.
PG  - 281-5
AB  - The effect of sodium salicylate and anaesthesia on the rectal absorption of
      theophylline was evaluated in rats. Theophylline proved to be slowly but
      completely absorbed on rectal infusion in conscious rats, compared with
      intravenous infusion. Pentobarbital anaesthesia did not influence absorption. In 
      contrast to literature data, the results with salicylate showed that rectal
      absorption of theophylline was not enhanced.

TI  - Effects of Ca antagonists on the action potential and their relationship to the
      muscarinic ACh actions in isolated sympathetic neurons of rabbits.
PG  - 205-10
AB  - Muscarinically induced depressions of the shoulder in the falling phase as well
      as the after-spike-hyperpolarization and -depolarization of the action potential 
      in the isolated sympathetic neurons of rabbits were mimicked by a novel peptide
      Ca channel blocker, omega-conotoxin (synthetic; 0.1-0.5 microM). Cobalt ions
      (0.1-2 mM) showed bidirectional effects on the shoulder, an early depression
      followed by a later prolongation, while they consistently induced depressions of 
      other components. Organic Ca channel blockers, verapamil and D-600 (1-50 microM) 
      and nifedipine (0.1-1 microM) appeared to have other effects as they rather
      caused a prolongation of the falling phase that was shortened by further
      application of acetylcholine.

TI  - Biphasic actions of L-DOPA on the release of endogenous dopamine via presynaptic 
      receptors in rat striatal slices.
PG  - 194-8
AB  - In rat striatal slices, 30 nM of L-DOPA increased the impulse (5 Hz)-evoked
      release of dopamine (DA), without increasing the spontaneous release and tissue
      content of DA. The minimum dose required to increase spontaneous DA release was
      0.1 microM and the dose which led to an accumulation of DA was 100 microM. In the
      presence of NSD-1055, a DOPA-decarboxylase inhibitor, L-DOPA-induced increases in
      spontaneous DA release were prevented and L-DOPA produced dual actions on the
      evoked release of DA, a stereoselective propranolol-sensitive increase at 30 nM
      and a stereoselective sulpiride-sensitive decrease at 1 microM. L-DOPA produces
      dual presynaptic regulatory actions on DA release, via facilitatory
      beta-adrenoceptors at 30 nM and inhibitory DA receptors at 1 microM. The primary 
      action of L-DOPA appears to be the facilitation of release of DA rather than the 
      conversion to DA.

TI  - Octadecaneuropeptide, benzodiazepine ligand, -like immunoreactivity in rat
      central nervous system, plasma and peripheral tissues.
PG  - 183-8
AB  - Using a specific radioimmunoassay we have investigated the distribution of
      octadecaneuropeptide (a putative endogenous ligand at the benzodiazepine
      receptor)-like immunoreactivity (ODN-IR) in rat brain and peripheral tissues.
      Highest concentrations in brain were found in the hypothalamus, cerebellum and
      substantia nigra. Significant concentrations of ODN-IR were found in all
      peripheral tissues studied and in plasma. Chromatographic analysis revealed
      several molecular forms; one major form, indistinguishable from the synthetic
      peptide, was found predominantly in peripheral tissues and in plasma, while
      another major form, of higher molecular weight, was found in brain, peripheral
      tissues and plasma. Although ODN-IR was present in the synaptosomal fraction,
      concentrations in the microsomal fraction were higher than for other
      neuropeptides studied.

PG  - 158-62
AB  - The effects of micro-electrophoretically applied melatonin on the electrical
      activity of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of anaesthetized pigeons were
      studied. The proportion of excitatory and inhibitory responses to the pineal
      indoleamine varied significantly depending on whether the cells were tested
      during the day or at night. This day/night rhythm of responses was abolished if
      the birds were exposed to complete inversion of the vertical component of an
      artificial earth's strength magnetic field for one hour at 21.00 h. The results
      are in line with the concept that pineal involvement in endogenous central
      nervous rhythms is influenced by changes in the earth's magnetic field.

AB  - In chloralose-anaesthetized cats, the somata of cervical dorsal root ganglion
      cells with non-myelinated peripheral branches (group IV units) were impaled with

      The units were identified by their conduction velocity in the peripheral nerve
      (less than 2.5 m/s). After identification, HRP was injected iontophoretically
      into the soma. No significant correlation was found between the conduction
      velocity and cross-sectional areas of these somata. The soma sizes were
      distributed over a great portion of the whole size spectrum of the cells in the
      ganglia studied (C7 and C8).

PG  - 135-40
AB  - Sarcolemmal membranes were isolated from hindlimb muscles of the rat and the
      specific binding of [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin to the membranes was determined.
      Incubation of the membranes with a purified preparation of phospholipase C (ex
      Clostridium perfringens) increased the specific binding of the toxin (Bmax). The 
      apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding was unchanged by treatment
      with the enzyme. The possibility that latent acetylcholine receptors exist in
      muscle sarcolemma, and that these receptors can be activated by the enzyme, is
      discussed.

TI  - Relationship of parasagittal bands of acetylcholinesterase activity to the
      climbing fiber representation.
PG  - 128-34
AB  - The organization of the somatosensory representation by the climbing fiber system
      was correlated to parasagittal zones in the vermis, which were demarcated by the 
      parasagittal banding pattern of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity.
      Extracellular recordings were made of climbing fiber responses that were elicited
      by tactile stimulation in anesthetized cats. After the climbing fiber
      representation was mapped physiologically, the cerebellum was histologically

TI  - Major dopamine innervation of the cortical motor areas in the cynomolgus monkey. 
      A radioautographic study with comparative assessment of serotonergic afferents.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) innervations were revealed by radioautography 
      in primary motor, premotor and supplementary motor (SMA) cortex in Cynomolgus
      monkeys, using uptake of tritiated amines in vibratome sections under specific
      conditions that were previously established. DA and 5-HT axons were distributed
      throughout all cortical layers. A denser DA innervation was found in layers I,
      III and to a lesser extent layer V with a striking cluster-like arrangement in
      layer III, particularly in the SMA. 5-HT axons appeared less numerous; their
      lower density in comparison with DA axons was especially apparent in layer III,
      particularly in the premotor and motor areas. A DA-5-HT complementarity was thus 
      suggested in this layer. These results suggest that in addition to the motor
      control exerted through the nigrostriatal pathway, the cortical DA projections
      could directly modulate the neuronal activity in motor areas. This could be of
      major importance in the pathophysiology of motor disorders such as Parkinson's
      disease.

TI  - Fluorine-NMR studies of chimpanzee hemoglobin.
PG  - 372-4
AB  - It has been demonstrated that 4-fluorophenylalanine, a known inhibitor of protein
      synthesis, becomes incorporated into hemoglobin when present in the diet of a
      chimpanzee. 19F-NMR spectra of various forms of this protein show well-resolved
      lines, each line presumably corresponding to a unique
      phenylalanine/fluorophenylalanine position of the primary sequence. Fluorine
      chemical shifts and, by implication, tertiary structures vary with the oxidation 
      state and ligand.

TI  - Re-evaluation of the role of thiol groups in rabbit muscle aldolase A.
PG  - 365-7
AB  - Exposed thiol groups of rabbit muscle aldolase A were modified by
      5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid with concomittant loss of enzyme activity.
      When 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate residues bound to enzyme SH groups were replaced by
      small and uncharged cyanide residues the enzyme activity was restored by more
      than 50%. The removal of a bulky C-terminal tyrosine residue from the active site
      of aldolase A resulted in enzyme which was inhibited by
      5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid only by 50% and its activity was nearly
      unchanged after modification of its thiol groups with cyanide. The results
      obtained show directly that rabbit muscle aldolase A does not possess functional 
      cysteine residues and that the inactivation of the enzyme caused by sulfhydryl
      group modification reported previously can be attributed most likely to steric
      hindrance of a catalytic site by modifying agents.

TI  - The reactivity and function of cysteine residues in rabbit liver aldolase B.
PG  - 337-46
AB  - Rabbit liver aldolase B (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
      D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, EC 4.1.2.13) contains 8 SH groups/subunit and
      no disulfide bonds. In the native enzyme 3 SH groups/subunit are titrable with
      5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (Nbs2), 2,2'-dithiodipyridine and
      N-ethylmaleimide, whereas p-mercuribenzoate is able to react with 4 thiol groups 
      per subunit. Among the three thiol groups titrable with Nbs2, two react 'fast'
      with simple second-order kinetics, one reacts 'slow' and for this thiol group
      saturation kinetics is observed, suggesting a reversible binding of Nbs2 to the
      enzyme prior to covalent modification. It is shown that this binding most likely 
      occurs via ionic interactions in the region close to the active site. The kinetic
      differentiation between the two 'fast' reacting groups is possible by kinetic
      analysis of the release of Nbs residues from the modified enzyme. Modification of
      all exposed SH groups of aldolase B results in 14-32% loss of enzymatic activity.
      The complete inactivation of liver aldolase by 1 mM p-mercuribenzoate reported
      previously (Waud, J.M., Feldman, E. and Schray, K.J. (1981) Arch. Biochem.
      Biophys. 206, 292-295) is shown to be caused by a nonspecific reaction of this
      reagent used in large excess. It is concluded that this isoenzyme differs from
      muscle aldolase in the reactivity of exposed SH groups, the mechanisms of the
      interaction with modifying agents and also in the effect of SH group modification
      on the enzymatic activity.

TI  - The action of factor Xa on peptide p-nitroanilide substrates: substrate
      selectivity and examination of hydrolysis with different reaction conditions.
PG  - 326-36
AB  - Kinetic parameters for the action of bovine Factor Xa (EC 3.4.21.22) on 25
      commercially available peptide p-nitroanilides have been determined. The
      selectivity constant, kc/Km, ranges from 1.5 X 10(1) to 2 X 10(6) M-1 X s-1 for
      the poorest and the best substates, respectively. The best substrates for Factor 
      Xa were identified as those with arginine in the P1 position, and glycine in the 
      P2 position. Quantitative distinction between lysine and arginine in the P1
      position and other amino acids in the P2-P4 positions of the substrate is
      reported from the changes in the kinetic parameters for substrates differing in
      only a single amino acid in these positions. Effect of NaCl and CaCl2
      concentrations and temperature on the action of Factor Xa on selected substrates 
      have been assessed. Km values for Factor Xa hydrolysis of most substrates are
      greater than 100 microM. Solubility of the substrates consequently restricts
      measurements of reaction velocities to concentrations lower than desirable for
      optimally determining kc. Comparison of these kinetic parameters for Factor Xa
      with those of thrombin (Lottenberg, R., Hall, J.A., Blinder, M., Binder, E. and
      Jackson, C.M. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 742,539-557) for these same
      substrates indicates that the greater hydrolytic efficiency of thrombin is due
      primarily to lower Km values.

      cytochrome b5 in solution.
PG  - 274-84
AB  - Cytochrome b5 reconstituted with specifically deuterated hemins has led to the
      assignment of the resolved 6,7 beta-propionate protons and heme meso protons.
      Freshly reconstituted cytochrome b5 contains a mixture of two isomers in an
      approx. 1:1 ratio. As time proceeds the minor isomer decreases in intensity until
      the equilibrium ratio, approx. 8:1, of the two isomers is reached. The rate of
      the heme disorder kinetics was investigated for cytochrome b5 as a function of
      pH, oxidation state and 2,4 heme substitutents. Comparison of the kinetic data
      for cytochrome b5 with that obtained for other b-type heme proteins supports the 
      proposal that the heme disorder arises from a 180 degree rotation of the heme
      about the alpha, gamma-meso axis. Computer-difference methods allow the spectra
      of the two individual isomers to be generated. Comparison of the NMR spectral
      parameters for the two individual isomers indicates small structural differences 
      for amino acid side-chain orientations.

TI  - A Fourier transform infrared investigation of the structural differences between 
      ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S.
PG  - 255-65
AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate the small
      conformational differences which exist between ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S 
      in aqueous systems. Deconvolution and derivative methods were used to observe the
      overlapping components of the amide I and II bands. These proteins give identical
      spectra in H2O and after complete exchange in 2H2O. However structural
      differences are revealed by monitoring the rate of 1H-2H exchange by Fourier
      transform infrared spectroscopy. At equivalent times of exposure in 2H2O buffer
      ribonuclease S undergoes greater isotopic exchange than ribonuclease A. Thus
      complete exchange takes place for ribonuclease S but not ribonuclease A after
      incubation at room temperature for 8 days. Complete 1H-2H exchange of
      ribonuclease A was achieved by incubation at 62 degrees C for 30 min. The
      available X-ray data and comparison with the infrared spectra of other soluble
      proteins was used to assign the components of the amide I and II bands to various
      secondary structures. In particular, band shifts observed during the later stages
      of exchange are associated with slowly exchanging residues in beta-strand and
      alpha-helical regions. The higher rate of exchange for ribonuclease S is
      associated with a greater conformational flexibility and a more open structure.
      The results show that it is necessary to be cautious in making band assignments
      based on exchange methods unless the extent of exchange is known. Furthermore, it
      is seen that the combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
      hydrogen-deuterium exchange is a powerful technique for revealing small
      differences in protein secondary structure.

TI  - Physical theory of the orientation of astral mitotic spindles.
PG  - 1413-6
AB  - A physical theory was developed for mitotic spindle orientation. This is
      important because spindle position is known to determine the placement of the
      cleavage furrow separating the offspring of a mitosis. The theory is based on an 
      equation for the force exerted on spindle poles by the interaction of astral
      microtubules with the cell surface. Expected spindle placements are positions of 
      stable equilibrium where the net force and torque resulting from the action of
      the astral microtubules on the spindle poles is zero. The theory provides a novel
      physical explanation of cleavage patterns in the early embryo.

TI  - Characterization of T cell receptor gamma chain expression in a subset of murine 
      thymocytes.
PG  - 1401-5
AB  - While much information exists about the structure and function of the clonally
      distributed T cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta heterodimer, little is known about
      the gamma protein, the product of a third rearranging TCR gene. An antiserum to a
      carboxyl-terminal peptide common to several of the murine gamma chain constant
      regions and a monoclonal antibody to the murine T3 complex were used to identify 
      products of this TCR gene family in a subpopulation of Lyt2-, L3T4- thymocytes.
      This subpopulation does not express TCR alpha or full-length TCR beta messenger
      RNA. The gamma chain is a 35-kilodalton (kD) protein that is disulfide-bonded to 
      a 45-kD partner and is associated with the T3 complex. Analysis of the
      glycosylation pattern of this thymic gamma chain revealed that the major variable
      region gamma (V gamma) gene transcribed in activated peripheral T cells is absent
      from this subpopulation. The cells that bear this second T cell receptor may
      therefore represent a distinct lineage differentiating within the thymus.

TI  - Inhibition of secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen by a related presurface
      polypeptide.
PG  - 1388-91
AB  - The presurface (preS) proteins of hepatitis B virus are structural components of 
      the viral envelope that may play important roles in virion assembly and
      infectivity. They are specified by a large open reading frame that includes the
      coding region for the major surface (S) protein in its 3' half. Translation of
      the preS proteins initiates upstream from the S region, giving rise to proteins
      that are composed of the S domain and an additional 163 (preS1) or 55 (preS2)
      amino acids. Little is known about the biosynthesis and assembly of these
      proteins. The expression of the S and preS1 proteins was examined by transfecting
      cultured mammalian cells with viral DNA and injecting synthetic messenger RNA's
      into Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to the proteins encoded by the S region, the
      preS1 proteins are not detectably secreted into the culture medium. Furthermore, 
      when the S and preS1 proteins are synthesized together, secretion of the S
      proteins is specifically and strongly inhibited. The results suggest a unique
      molecular interaction during secretion of the S and preS proteins that may be
      important for virus assembly.

TI  - Ultraviolet irradiation transforms C3H10T1/2 cells to a unique, suppressible
      phenotype.
PG  - 1385-8
AB  - Transformation of C3H10T1/2 cells by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation
      followed by tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) has been used as a model of
      two-stage carcinogenesis. However, cells cloned from UV-TPA-induced foci (UV-TDTx
      cells) had a unique phenotype. Cloned UV-TDTx cells appeared transformed in pure 
      culture but were unable to form foci when cocultured with C3H10T1/2 cells.
      However, in the presence of TPA, UV-TDTx cells form foci in mixed culture with
      C3H10T1/2 cells. This phenotype was the only one observed for UV-TPA
      transformants. These data suggest that communal suppression of cell division is a
      discrete phenomenon that must be overcome as one step in the multistage process
      of transformation, and this protocol permits the routine isolation of transformed
      cells responsive to density-dependent growth suppression.

      Hypertension, which demonstrated prospectively the benefit of treatment of
      diastolic blood pressure in the range of 95 to 109 mm Hg, a retrospective
      analysis that classified subjects by the average diastolic pressure level
      attained during the trial purported to show an absence of treatment benefit at
      lower average diastolic pressures and a negative treatment effect at higher
      levels. However, the method of classification by average attained diastolic
      pressure introduced substantial selection bias, invalidating the retrospective
      analysis and rendering as spurious both the deleterious treatment effect and its 
      lack of efficacy at lower diastolic levels.

      dramatic change in excretion half-life of the mercury, from 33.1 days before
      treatment to 11.2 days during therapy. No significant toxic effects related to
      drug therapy were observed. Clearing of hematuria and reversal of
      electromyographic abnormalities were prompt in the symptomatic patient. Therapy
      with 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate was effective in these two patients.

TI  - Medical care costs of patients with AIDS in San Francisco.
PG  - 3103-6
AB  - This article reports on the findings of a study of medical care expenditures of
      persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treated at San Francisco
      General Hospital in 1984. We found that mean charges per AIDS hospital admission 
      were $9024, mean charges of patients with AIDS who received all their hospital
      inpatient and outpatient care at San Francisco General Hospital in 1984 ranged
      from $7026 to $23,425, and mean lifetime inpatient charges of patients with AIDS 
      who died and who had received all their inpatient care at the hospital were
      $27,571. These latter charges were considerably lower than previously published
      estimates of lifetime direct medical care costs of patients with AIDS, and the
      possible reasons for the differences include much lower lifetime use of hospital 
      services and somewhat lower cost per hospital day.

PG  - 1927-30
AB  - A woman gardener of 49 years of age suffered an inhalational intoxication from
      chlorine dioxide while bleaching dried flowers. Preparation of the bleaching
      solutions was associated with a sharp pungent smell, coughing, pharyngeal
      irritation and headache. Seven hours later increasing cough and dyspnoea led to
      hospitalisation. Clinical findings were tachypnoea, tachycardia, and rales of
      auscultation; clinical chemistry revealed marked leucocytosis. Chest X-ray did
      not yield any abnormal findings. Initially the vital capacity and forced
      expiratory volume in 1 s markedly reduced and the resistance correspondingly
      enhanced. Blood gas analysis showed hypoxaemia despite alveolar hyperventilation.
      Administration of corticosteroids resulted in significant alleviation of
      complaints and in improved lung function with stabilisation in a highly normal
      range, as confirmed by follow-up examination two years later. The chlorine
      dioxide intoxication had been due to pH level reduction resulting from an
      incorrect proportioning and handling of the individual bleaching agent components
      when preparing the solution.

TI  - [Iodized salt consumption and sodium chloride metabolism].
PG  - 1916-21
AB  - In 42 families from Dortmund common table salt was replaced by iodized salt. In
      adults and adolescents over 12 years (n = 95) median intake of iodized salt at
      home was 1.9 g/d, in schoolchildren between 6 and 12 years (n = 36) 1.6 g/d and
      in small children (n = 20) 0.9 g/d. The range of the individual intake of iodized
      salt was large. Only 7% of the adults and the adolescents used more than 5 g/d.
      Only 39% of the daily consumption of iodized salt was directly added to the food 
      consumed, whereas 61%, used e. g. to season cooking water, was only partially
      ingested. Overall urinary excretion of sodium chloride within the groups studied 
      did not differ from data from other German groups. In men and boys median urinary
      excretion of sodium chloride was 12.2 g/d, in women and girls 9.5 g/d, in
      schoolchildren 5.9 g/d, and in small children 3.5 g/d. The consumption of iodized
      salt at home with an iodine concentration of 20 micrograms/g may increase iodine 
      intake in adults and adolescents by about 20 micrograms/d. As an iodine deficit
      of about 100 micrograms/d cannot be met by regular consumption of iodized salt at
      home the present concept for prophylaxis of iodine deficiency should be revised.

PG  - 147-52
AB  - Combining intracellular recording techniques with immunocytochemistry revealed
      the existence of serotonin within a few ganglion cells of the turtle retina.
      Lucifer yellow was intracellularly injected into physiologically classified
      ganglion cells. Sections containing labeled somata were subsequently incubated
      with an antibody directed against serotonin and immunoreactivity was revealed
      using horseradish peroxidase as a marker. In 3 ganglion cells the two markers
      were co-localized. These cells ramified in layers 2 and 3 of the inner plexiform 
      layer and produced color opponent ON-OFF photoresponses.

TI  - Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor purified from a Hodgkin's 
      tumor cell line.
PG  - 266-73
AB  - Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was purified from
      3 liters of serum-free conditioned medium of the Hodgkin's tumor cell line L428
      KSA. The conditioned medium contained a high specific activity of 2.5 X 10(5)
      units of total colony-stimulating factor per mg protein. Colony-stimulating
      factor activity was determined by colony formation by human fetal liver cells or 
      mouse bone marrow cells. The latter bioassay discriminated colony-stimulating
      factor 1, a subclass specific for monocyte/macrophage production, and G-CSF,
      specific for granulopoiesis, from GM-CSF. The starting material contained
      predominantly GM-CSF with CSF-1 and G-CSF constituting 10% and 12%, respectively,
      of the total activity. A seven-stage purification scheme was employed. The first 
      stage involved concentration by batch chromatography on calcium phosphate gel.
      Subsequent stages involved gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA44, affinity
      chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, batch chromatography on calcium
      phosphate gel and high-performance liquid chromatography on C1 reversed-phase
      (TSK TMS-250), gel permeation and C8 reversed-phase columns. The purified
      material showed a single disperse band, having an Mr of 30,000, by silver
      staining on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An
      amino-terminal sequence of 20 amino acids was determined in a gas-phase sequencer
      with 500 ng of purified material. The sequence was identical to that predicted
      from the cDNA sequence. It was active on human fetal liver cells with
      half-maximum colony formation at 1 X 10(-12) M, but was not active on mouse bone 
      narrow cells.

AB  - Complex social relationships among nonhuman primates appear to contribute to
      individual reproductive success. Experiments with and behavioral observations of 
      natural populations suggest that sophisticated cognitive mechanisms may underlie 
      primate social relationships. Similar capacities are usually less apparent in the
      nonsocial realm, supporting the view that at least some aspects of primate
      intelligence evolved to solve the challenges of interacting with conspecifics.

TI  - [The antinuclear antibody spectrum in circumscribed forms of scleroderma].
PG  - 1922-7
AB  - Sera from 56 patients with circumscribed scleroderma (CS) were tested for the
      presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence on
      HEp-2-cells. 16 patients (28.6%) had ANA, mostly in low titers of 1: 40 and with 
      uncharacteristic fluorescence patterns. Nucleolar antibodies as in progressive
      systemic sclerosis were seen in a few cases only. Two female patients
      demonstrated antibodies with a centromere-like pattern. ANA were most frequently 
      found in patients with atrophodermia idiopathica progressiva (60%) and in linear 
      CS (44%). Rheumatoid factor was present in 62% of patients with linear CS; it was
      less frequent in other forms of CS. Antibodies against double-stranded DNA were
      found only in one female patient, but three patients with systemic involvement
      had antibodies to single-stranded DNA. Antibodies to soluble nuclear Scl-70,
      Ul-RNP and LA(SSB) antigens or to the cytoplasmatic Ro(SSA)-antigen,
      respectively, were not detected in the patients with CS. These results
      demonstrate that humoral autoimmune phenomena may occur in CS, mainly in patients
      with linear CS. These phenomena, however, are less frequent and specific than in 
      progressive systemic sclerosis or in other collagen vascular diseases.

      double-blind study].
PG  - 1910-5
AB  - 134 outpatients with acute benign gastric ulcer confirmed by endoscopic biopsy
      received either 1 g sucralfate suspension four times daily or one 150 mg
      ranitidine tablet twice daily for six to 12 weeks in a multicentre therapy study 
      (double-blind study according to the double-dummy technique). After six to 12
      weeks, respectively, 56% and 82% of the ulcers had healed in the sucralfate
      group. The rates of healing in the ranitidine group were 72% and 88%,
      respectively. The differences in the rates of healing between sucralfate and
      ranitidine were not statistically significant. Ranitidine was superior to the
      sucralfate suspension in corpus ulcer. In the distally located ulcers, the two
      kinds of treatment were equivalent. There were no appreciable differences between
      the medications with regard to antacid consumption and compliance. Gastric pain
      was influenced better by ranitidine than by sucralfate.

TI  - 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment decreases dopamine 
      and increases lipofuscin in mouse retina.
PG  - 221-6
AB  - The compound 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a relatively 
      selective neurotoxin that destroys dopamine (DA)-containing nigrostriatal
      neurons. We have now studied the effects of MPTP on retinal dopaminergic neurons.
      Acute treatment resulted in the accumulation of DA when evaluated by direct
      chemical analysis or histofluorescence. Chronic treatment resulted in a decrease 
      of DA, an apparent loss of fluorescent cells, and a striking increase of
      lipofuscin in the retina. Thus, MPTP may be a useful drug for studying the
      dopaminergic neuronal system of retina and the possible link between neurons and 
      the accumulation of lipofuscin.

TI  - The Fos protein complex is associated with DNA in isolated nuclei and binds to
      DNA cellulose.
PG  - 1417-9
AB  - The properties of the viral and cellular fos proteins (Fos) were investigated as 
      a first step toward understanding the function of the fos gene. Treatment of
      nuclei with salt and nonionic detergents solubilized a complex that contained Fos
      together with several other cellular proteins. The majority of the Fos protein
      complex was released from isolated nuclei incubated in the presence of
      deoxyribonuclease I or micrococcal nuclease but not with ribonuclease A,
      suggesting that Fos is associated with chromatin. This hypothesis is supported by
      the finding that Fos protein from native or denatured nuclear extracts exhibited 
      DNA-binding activity in vitro. These results suggest that Fos is involved in the 
      regulation of gene expression.

TI  - Determination of junction avidity of cytolytic T cell and target cell.
PG  - 1405-8
AB  - A direct measurement of the avidity of the junction between a cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte and its target cell was achieved by using a biophysical approach. A
      micromanipulation technique was used to determine the force required to separate 
      a cytotoxic T cell (human clone F1, with specificity for HLA-DRw6) from its
      specific target cell (JY: HLA-A2, -B7, -DR4, w6) prior to delivery of the lethal 
      hit. The force required to separate the F1-JY pair is 1.5 X 10(4) dynes per
      square centimeter. This junction avidity for F1-JY pairs is 6 to 13 times greater
      than that for F1-F1 and JY-JY pairs; the F1-JY conjugate requires a stronger
      separating force and is more easily rejoined than the homologous cell pairs. This
      study provides an estimate of the avidity of cytotoxic T cells for their target
      cells and insights into the biophysical correlates of the molecular complexes
      formed in the interaction of cytotoxic T cells and their targets during the
      cytotoxic process.

TI  - The nucleocapsid of hepatitis B virus is both a T-cell-independent and a
      T-cell-dependent antigen.
PG  - 1398-401
AB  - One characteristic of the immune response during hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      infection in humans is the vigorous production and subsequent persistence of
      antibodies of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M and G to the nucleocapsid antigen
      (HBcAg). In this study HBcAg was shown to be similarly immunogenic in mice. When 
      injected into athymic (nude) B10.BR and athymic BALB/c mice, HBcAg induced IgM
      and IgG class antibodies to HBc in spite of the absence of T cells in nude mice. 
      In euthymic mice, HBcAg efficiently stimulated T-cell proliferation in vitro and 
      helper T-cell function in vivo. The dual functions of HBcAg as a
      T-cell-independent and a T-cell-dependent antigen may explain its enhanced
      immunogenicity. Denaturation of HBcAg yields a nonparticulate antigen designated 
      HBeAg; when HBeAg was used as the immunogen, antibody production required helper 
      T-cell function. Although HBcAg and HBeAg are serologically distinct, they are
      structurally related, and in these experiments were highly cross-reactive at the 
      T-cell level. These results suggest that the elevated levels of IgM antibodies to
      HBc and the enhanced immunogenicity of HBcAg during HBV infection in humans
      reflect the ability of HBcAg to directly activate B cells to produce antibodies
      to HBc in the presence or absence of HBcAg- or HBeAg-sensitized T cells.

TI  - High-dose recombinant interleukin 2 in the treatment of patients with
      disseminated cancer. Responses, treatment-related morbidity, and histologic
      findings.
PG  - 3117-24
AB  - Experience with the administration of high doses of interleukin 2 (IL-2) alone is
      described herein. Ten patients with a variety of malignant disorders unresponsive
      to conventional treatments were treated with at least 30,000 U/kg of IL-2 by
      bolus administration three times a day. Patients were treated intravenously or
      intraperitoneally from four to 21 days in a single course, usually interrupted by
      a week of recovery. Three of six patients with melanoma experienced an objective 
      regression (greater than 50% decrease in volume); there was no response to
      treatment in patients with colorectal (0/3) or ovarian (0/1) cancer. Two patients
      with initial objective regressions who subsequently developed progression were
      re-treated and one sustained a second partial response. Responses lasted 1, 3,
      and 7 months without additional treatment. Responses in the three patients with
      melanoma were in visceral sites (lung, liver, and spleen), as well as cutaneous
      sites in one patient. Progressive shrinkage of tumors for three to six months
      after the conclusion of therapy has been noted in two patients. Marked
      lymphocytic infiltrate was noted in a patient with lesions accessible to repeated
      biopsies. This study demonstrates that the administration of IL-2 can mediate the
      regression of established cancer in some patients.

TI  - Medical care costs of AIDS in Massachusetts.
PG  - 3107-9
AB  - Previous investigation has suggested that the direct cost of medical care for the
      24,011 reported patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may be as
      high as $147,000 per patient. To evaluate the use and cost of medical services
      for patients with AIDS in Massachusetts, we performed a one-year cost of illness 
      study of 45 AIDS patients. Sociodemographic and clinical data as well as
      information on medical utilization were obtained from review of outpatient and
      hospital records. Patients with AIDS required a mean of 3.3 (+/- 3.2)
      hospitalizations per year and 18.4 (+/- 21.8) ambulatory visits per year.
      Overall, medical costs averaged $46,505 +/- $38,720 per patient per year, with
      91% of these expenditures related to use of inpatient services. These results
      suggest that the cost of medical care for AIDS patients may be substantially less
      than previously estimated.

      with occupational exposure.
PG  - 3099-102
AB  - A study of seroprevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus involving 2384
      (96%) of Mama Yemo Hospital's (Kinshasa, Zaire) 2492 personnel found 152 (6.4%)
      to be seropositive. Prevalence was higher among women than among men (8.1% vs
      5.2%); in women peak seroprevalence (13.9%) occurred in 20- to 29-year-olds.
      Workers most likely to be seropositive were those who were relatively young,
      those who were unmarried, those reporting a blood transfusion or hospitalization 
      during the previous ten years, and those receiving medical injections during the 
      previous three years. Medical, administrative, and manual workers had similar
      seroprevalence (6.5%, 6.4%, and 6.0%, respectively), and seropositivity was not
      associated with any measure of patient, blood, or needle contact. These findings 
      are consistent with other hospital-based studies indicating low risks for
      occupational transmission of human immunodeficiency virus.

AB  - Solutions of 0.6 mg/ml mitomycin C (Mutamycin) in NaCl solution 0.9% in plastic
      minibags for intravesical use were stored at -20 degrees C and -30 degrees C and 
      thawed by microwave radiation. Both unbuffered solutions and solutions buffered
      to approximately pH 7.5 were investigated. Concentrations were measured with
      HPLC. During freezing and storage at -20 degrees C sometimes crystallization of
      mitomycin C occurred. However, both buffered and unbuffered solutions could be
      frozen at -30 degrees C during at least four weeks and subsequently thawed
      without loss of content. Unbuffered mitomycin C solutions could be refrozen at
      -30 degrees C for another four weeks. Also buffered and unbuffered solutions of
      another brand of mitomycin C (Mitomycin-C Kyowa) could be frozen at -30 degrees C
      during four weeks without significant deterioration.

TI  - Detection of tracking errors by visual climbing fiber inputs to monkey cerebellar
      flocculus during pursuit eye movements.
PG  - 163-8
AB  - The activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells was monitored in alert monkeys during
      visually guided smooth pursuit eye movements. The climbing fiber input evokes
      'complex-spikes' which show increased firing during the contralateral phase of
      sinusoidal pursuit. 'Complex-spike triggered averaging' revealed that the
      increased firing is a visual response to the retina slip which results from
      inaccurate tracking. The complex-spikes in turn cause a transient reduction in
      the simple-spike pursuit command signal that emanates from the flocculus and this
      may contribute to the corrective eye movement. We postulate that the detection
      (and possibly the correction) of small errors in motor performance may be a
      general function of climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellum.

      phosphorylase: 7-methylguanosine and 7-methylinosine.
PG  - 355-63
AB  - The properties of two unusual substrates of calf spleen purine-nucleoside
      phosphorylase (purine-nucleoside:orthophosphate ribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.1), 
      7-methylguanosine and 7-methylinosine, are described. The corresponding bases,
      7-methylguanine and 7-methylhypoxanthine, are neither substrates in the reverse, 
      synthetic reaction, nor inhibitors of the phosphorolysis reaction. Both
      nucleosides exhibit fluorescence, which disappears on cleavage of the glycosidic 
      bond, providing a new convenient procedure for continuous fluorimetric assay of
      enzymatic activity. For 7-methylguanosine at neutral pH and 25 degrees C, Vmax = 
      3.3 mumol/min per unit enzyme and Km = 14.7 microM, so that Vmax/Km = 22 X
      10(-2)/min per unit as compared to 8 X 10(-2) for the commonly used substrate
      inosine. The permissible initial substrate concentration range is 5-100 microM.
      Enzyme activity may also be monitored spectrophotometrically. For
      7-methylinosine, Vmax/Km is much lower, 2.4 X 10(-2), but its 10-fold higher
      fluorescence partially compensates for this, and permits the use of initial
      substrate concentrations in the range 1-500 microM. At neutral pH both substrates
      are mixtures of cationic and zwitterionic forms. Measurements of pH-dependence of
      kinetic constants indicated that the cationic forms are the preferred substrates,
      whereas the monoanion of inosine appears to be almost as good a substrate as the 
      neutral form. With 7-methylguanosine as substrate, and monitoring of activity
      fluorimetrically and spectrophotometrically, inhibition constants were measured
      for several known inhibitors, and the results compared with those obtained with
      inosine as substrate, and with results reported for the enzyme from other
      sources.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor reduces c-myc expression and cooperates with
      interferon-gamma in HeLa cells.
PG  - 1419-21
AB  - The suppression of the c-myc nuclear oncogene is associated with growth arrest
      and may therefore be directly controlled by naturally occurring growth
      inhibitors. The effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and of interferon-gamma
      (IFN-gamma) on c-myc expression was investigated in HeLa cells, which respond to 
      these cytokines by a specific arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.
      Northern blot and nuclear transcription analyses indicated that each cytokine
      reduced within 1 to 3 hours the c-myc messenger RNA levels as a result of
      transcriptional inhibition. Adding the two cytokines together at saturating
      levels resulted in enhanced inhibition of c-myc transcription and of the c-myc
      messenger RNA steady-state levels. While the reduction of c-myc messenger RNA by 
      IFN-gamma was dependent on new protein synthesis, the inhibitory effect of TNF on
      c-myc messenger RNA was direct and was not abrogated by cycloheximide. The
      differential effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor and the cooperative
      inhibitory effects of the two cytokines when added together suggest that
      IFN-gamma and TNF reduce c-myc transcription through different molecular
      mechanisms.

TI  - The hypogonadal mouse: reproductive functions restored by gene therapy.
PG  - 1372-8
AB  - The hypogonadal (hpg) mouse lacks a complete gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      (GnRH) gene and consequently cannot reproduce. Introduction of an intact GnRH
      gene into the genome of these mutant mice resulted in complete reversal of the
      hypogonadal phenotype. Transgenic hpg/hpg homozygotes of both sexes were capable 
      of mating and producing offspring. Pituitary and serum concentrations of
      luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were restored to
      those of normal animals. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization showed
      that GnRH expression was restored in the appropriate hypothalamic neurons of the 
      transgenic hpg animals, an indication of neural-specific expression of the
      introduced gene.

TI  - Tifluadom, a kappa-opiate agonist, acts as a peripheral cholecystokinin receptor 
      antagonist.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - Tifluadom, a benzodiazepine kappa-opiate agonist, stereoselectively inhibited the
      binding of 125I-CCK to pancreatic membranes (IC50 = 47 nM). Several other opiate 
      agonists were ineffective. Scatchard analysis indicated the inhibition of CCK
      binding by tifluadom was competitive in nature. Tifluadom (1 microM) did not
      displace 125I-CCK binding to brain tissue or 125I-gastrin binding to fundic
      glands. In the isolated guinea pig gallbladder, tifluadom antagonized CCK-8
      induced contractions with an estimated pA2 of 6.8. These data demonstrate that
      tifluadom is a peripherally selective CCK antagonist. This unique action could
      contribute to its reported analgesic and appetite stimulatory properties.

TI  - Evidence that endogenous enkephalins produce delta-opiate receptor mediated
      neuronal inhibitions in rat dorsal horn.
PG  - 179-82
AB  - Kelatorphan, a full inhibitor of aminopeptidases, enkephalinase and
      dipeptidylaminopeptidase, enzymes which degrade the enkephalins, produced
      inhibitions (around 50%) of dorsal horn C fibre evoked responses in the rat,
      following local application. The inhibitions were reversed by the selective
      delta-opiate receptor antagonists ICI 174,864. Furthermore the inhibitions
      produced by two doses of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAGO), a potent selective
      mu-opiate receptor agonist, were not altered in the presence of kelatorphan, so
      demonstrating an additive effect of the mu-agonist and the enzyme inhibitor. The 
      inhibitions produced by the enzyme inhibitor would seem due to an increased
      availability of endogenous opioids, presumably the enkephalins which act via the 
      delta-opiate receptor.

AB  - The effect of food deprivation for 72 h or a high fat diet on [3H]naloxone
      binding in the discrete brain regions of male lean Zucker rats was studied. In

      high-affinity site. These results suggest that dietary manipulations could
      produce significant changes in the endogenous opioid system.

TI  - NH2-terminal spin labeling of human hemoglobin--spin states and temperature
      dependence.
PG  - 312-7
AB  - In order to explore fully how ligand- and temperature-induced alterations in the 
      spin states of heme iron are related to protein readjustments, the spin label
      4-isothiocyanate (I) was covalently attached at beta-93 cysteines and at
      NH2-terminal valines of various heme-iron ligand forms of human hemoglobin. It
      was found that the mobility of NH2-terminally bound spin labels depends on the
      magnetic moment of the heme iron. There is a an approximately linear relationship
      between the magnetic moment of the heme iron and the mobility of NH2-terminally
      bound spin labels. In accordance with our previous results, the temperature
      dependence of ESR spectra of spin-labeled hemoglobin suggests the
      temperature-induced protein conformational change in those heme-iron ligand forms
      that are characterized by the equilibrium of the spin states of the heme iron.
      The conformational change was sensed at both spin-label-binding sites: at beta-93
      cysteines and at NH2-terminal valines.

TI  - Tissue-specific and ectopic expression of genes introduced into transgenic mice
      by retroviruses.
PG  - 1409-13
AB  - Recombinant retroviruses containing the complete genomic human beta globin gene
      (under the control of its own promoter) and the bacterial neomycin
      phosphotransferase gene (under the control of the normal or enhancerless viral
      promoter) were used to derive transgenic mouse strains by infection of
      preimplantation embryos. Expression of the beta globin gene in hematopoietic
      tissues was observed in all transgenic strains. In addition, one strain showed
      ectopic expression of beta globin in the same tissues that also expressed high
      levels of RNA from the viral promoter. It is likely that expression from the long
      terminal repeat (LTR), in contrast to expression from the internal promoter, is
      dependent on the site of integration. Thus, retroviral vectors can be used for
      tissue-specific expression of foreign genes in transgenic mice, as well as for
      the identification of loci that allow developmental activation of a provirus.

      tissue sections, but immunocytochemical analysis failed to show the presence of
      antigen corresponding to any part of the precursor protein.

TI  - Cyclosporine improves psoriasis in a double-blind study.
PG  - 3110-6
AB  - In a double-blind trial, 21 patients with severe plaque psoriasis were randomly
      assigned to receive oral cyclosporine, 14 mg/kg/d, or its vehicle. After four
      weeks of therapy the 11 cyclosporine recipients had the following response to
      treatment: two had total clearing and six improved markedly, two moderately, and 
      one minimally; whereas ten vehicle-treated patients showed no change or minimal
      improvement. Vehicle-treated patients, after a switch to cyclosporine for four
      weeks, demonstrated impressive improvement similar to that seen in patients who
      initially received only cyclosporine. Moderate or marked improvement or total
      clearing was noted in 17 (81%) of 21 and 20 (95%) of 21 after one and four weeks 
      of therapy, respectively. Mitotic figures and leukotriene B4 levels in lesions
      decreased 86% and 64%, respectively, after seven days of cyclosporine therapy.
      Mononuclear (including activated T cells) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte
      infiltrates were markedly reduced in lesions of all patients after seven days of 
      cyclosporine therapy. These results suggest that psoriasis may have an
      immunologic basis mediated by activated T cells and/or other immune cells; if a
      long-term regimen with a favorable efficacy-side effect ratio can be determined, 
      cyclosporine would be a significant advance in the treatment of psoriasis.

TI  - Localization of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-immunoreactive material in the
      hypothalamo-pituitary complex of the frog.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - The presence of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-like material in the
      hypothalamo-pituitary complex of the frog (Rana ridibunda) was studied by means
      of indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold techniques. In the hypothalamus,
      numerous ANF-positive cell bodies were located in the preoptic nucleus, the
      lateral forebrain bundle and the dorsal infundibular nucleus. The ventral
      infundibular area and the median eminence contained only ANF-immunoreactive
      fibers. A dense network of fibers and nerve terminals was observed in the neural 
      lobe of the pituitary. Scarce nerve endings were also noted in the intermediate
      lobe whereas ANF-like immunoreactivity was totally absent in the anterior lobe of
      the pituitary. At the ultrastructural level, positive material appeared
      restricted to dense core vesicles (about 100 nm in diameter). These results
      demonstrate that an ANF-like substance is contained in nerve terminals of the
      frog pars nervosa, and support the hypothesis that ANF may exert a physiological 
      role in the control of release of neurohypophyseal peptides.

TI  - Physico-chemical properties of rat and dog cardiac alpha-actinin.
PG  - 347-54
AB  - alpha-Actinin exists in several polymorphic forms which appear to be
      characteristic of the muscle type from which it is isolated. In order to
      determine the possible physiological role of this structural protein in cardiac
      muscle, we describe and compare here the physico-chemical properties of cardiac
      alpha-actinin from two different mammalian species, rat (fast contracting muscle)
      and dog (slow contracting muscle). Purification of cardiac alpha-actinin was
      achieved by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite columns. The
      alpha-actinins isolated were different in their electrophoretic mobility
      (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), molecular size and alpha-helical
      content. However, their shape as revealed by electron microscopy and their
      activating effect on Mg2+-ATPase activity of actomyosin appear to be similar.
      These studies suggest that the rat and dog cardiac alpha-actinin are structurally
      different but functionally similar proteins.

      transitions in the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-adenosine triphosphatase of sarcoplasmic
      reticulum.
PG  - 305-11
AB  - Second and fourth derivatives have been calculated from the fluorescence emission
      spectra of N-acetyl tryptophanamide in solvents of varying polarity. It is
      demonstrated that the otherwise featureless fluorescence emission spectrum can be
      resolved into a series of discrete bands by the use of the derivative technique. 
      These bands appear to have their origins in the transitions of electrons from the
      first excited singlet state back to the various vibrational levels of the ground 
      state. The shifting of the fluorescence emission maximum to shorter wavelengths
      upon decreasing the solvent polarity is shown to be due to changes in the
      relative contributions of each of the bands combined with smaller changes in the 
      band positions. Derivative spectra have also been obtained from the intrinsic
      tryptophan fluorescence of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-adenosine triphosphatase of
      sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. A similar pattern of bands is observed to that 
      found in the model system and is consistent with the majority of the tryptophan
      residues being located in hydrophobic environments. Addition of calcium ions to
      the protein results in enhancement of the protein fluorescence accompanied by a
      small and hitherto unseen blue-shift of the spectrum. The mechanistic
      implications of this finding are discussed in relation to the calcium transport
      function of the protein.

TI  - 2-Oxo-[14C]glutarate is taken up by glutamatergic nerve terminals in the rat

PG  - 227-31
AB  - High affinity uptake of [14C]glutamate into rat striatal synaptosomes was reduced
      by 33% after bilateral cortical ablation. The lesion had no effect on striatal
      [14C]GABA uptake, but reduced 2-oxo-[14C]glutarate uptake by 67%. The results
      demonstrate the existence of a high-affinity uptake site for 2-oxoglutarate on
      glutamatergic nerve terminals and support the contention that this Krebs cycle
      intermediate may be used to replenish the neuronal pool of neurotransmitter
      glutamate. 2-Oxo-[14C]glutarate uptake may serve as a selective marker for
      glutamatergic neurones.

      dopaminergic neurons in cultures of dissociated rat mesencephalic neurons.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - Dopaminergic neurons were studied in cultures of dissociated cells from the
      ventral mesencephalon of fetal rat embryos (gestational day E15-16). After a week
      of growth, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or
      1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) was added to the growth medium for 24 h.
      Dopaminergic neurons were then visualized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
      immunocytochemistry or catecholamine (CA) cytofluorescence. Concentrations of
      MPTP in the range of 10 to 100 microM obliterated CA fluorescence without
      affecting the number of TH-positive neurons. At concentrations greater than 100
      microM, MPTP decreased the number of TH-positive neurons as well as the number of
      all other cell types. MPP+ (0.1-10.0 microM) produced a decrease in the number of
      TH-positive neurons without decreasing the total number of all cell types. The
      findings indicate that MPP+ but not MPTP is able to selectively destroy rat
      dopaminergic neurons in our cultures. The selective toxicity of MPP+ for
      dopaminergic neurons was partially prevented by pretreatment and co-incubation
      with mazindol (a selective inhibitor of dopamine uptake) but not by desipramine
      or deprenil, in confirmation of the notion that MPP+ enters dopaminergic neurons 
      by the specific uptake mechanism for dopamine.

TI  - Monoamine oxidase activity in chick cerebral microvessels.
PG  - 174-8
AB  - In chick brain microvessels, monoamine oxidase activity using catecholamines
      (dopamine and noradrenaline) and indoleamines (serotonin and tryptamine) as
      substrates was higher than that measured in synaptosomes and free mitochondria.
      In contrast, phenylalkyamines such as tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine were more
      deaminated in free mitochondria and synaptosomes than in microvessels. These
      results suggest that the activity of monoamine oxidase towards neurotransmitter
      amines in microvessels should be considered as a site of inactivation of these
      neurotransmitters in the chick brain parenchyma.

TI  - Activation of M2 muscarinic receptors causes an alteration of action potentials
      by modulation of Ca entry in isolated sympathetic neurons of rabbits.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - Activation of muscarinic receptors caused an alteration of the configuration of
      action potentials in the isolated sympathetic ganglion cells of rabbits, e.g.
      elimination of the shoulder in the falling phase and depression of the
      afterspike-hyperpolarization and after-depolarization. The responsible receptors 
      appeared to be of the M2-type since the above changes by the low concentration
      (greater than or equal to 10 nM) of muscarinic agonists were potently antagonized
      by AF-DX 116. Similar changes were induced by removing the external Ca2+ and no
      more changes were produced by further application of muscarinic agonists in the
      absence of external Ca2+. The action potential in sympathetic neurons is thus
      shown to be modulated via the M2 receptor possibly by regulating the Ca entry.

TI  - Oligodendrocyte adhesion activates protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of
      myelin basic protein.
PG  - 1395-8
AB  - When isolated adult oligodendrocytes adhere to a substratum myelinogenesis
      occurs. Investigation of the mechanism by which this happens indicated that the
      oligodendrocyte-substratum interaction activated protein kinase C-dependent
      phosphorylation of myelin basic protein and promoted the synthesis of myelin
      basic protein. In addition, when agents that activate protein kinase C (second
      messenger diacylglycerol or a tumor-promoting phorbol ester) were added to
      nonattached oligodendrocytes, they mimicked the influence of the substratum by
      inducing phosphorylation of myelin basic protein; and reagents that increase
      cellular adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) inhibited phosphorylation of
      myelin basic protein. Thus, at least in vitro, the interaction between
      oligodendrocytes and the substratum may mediate myelinogenic events, and
      phosphorylation of myelin basic protein may be an early requirement in the
      sequence of steps that ultimately results in myelin formation.

TI  - HTLV-III/LAV-neutralizing antibodies to an E. coli-produced fragment of the virus
      envelope.
PG  - 1392-5
AB  - Immunization with either an Escherichia coli recombinant segment of the human
      T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-III/LAV) envelope protein (gp 120) or with
      deglycosylated gp 120 envelope protein produced antibodies that neutralize
      HTLV-III/LAV infection in vitro. Virus neutralization titers of these antisera
      were equivalent to those obtained with purified native gp120 as immunogen. This
      localizes at least one class of neutralizing epitopes to the carboxyl-terminal
      half of the molecule. In addition, native gp120 prevented HTLV-III/LAV--mediated 
      cell fusion, whereas the recombinant gp120 fragment did not. This shows that
      although glycosylation is not required for induction of neutralizing antibodies, 
      it may be important for interaction with CD4, the virus receptor. A segment of
      the HTLV-III/LAV envelope produced in E. coli may be an important ingredient of a
      vaccine for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

TI  - Research toward malaria vaccines.
PG  - 1349-56
AB  - Malaria exacts a toll of disease to people in the Tropics that seems
      incomprehensible to those only familiar with medicine and human health in the
      developed world. The methods of molecular biology, immunology, and cell biology
      are now being used to develop an antimalarial vaccine. The Plasmodium parasites
      that cause malaria have many stages in their life cycle. Each stage is
      antigenically distinct and potentially could be interrupted by different
      vaccines. However, achieving complete protection by vaccination may require a
      better understanding of the complexities of B- and T-cell priming in natural
      infections and the development of an appropriate adjuvant for use in humans.

TI  - Chronic measurement of cardiac output in unanesthetized rats using miniature
      thermocouples.
PG  - H1365-72
AB  - A thermodilution technique is described for measuring steady-state cardiac output
      (CO) in conscious rats for periods of 2-3 wk. The method utilizes small
      implantable aortic thermocouples inserted via the femoral artery at the time of
      placement of other chronic indwelling catheters. Data are presented to validate
      the accuracy and reproducibility of the technique by acute in situ comparison
      with electromagnetic flowmeter measurements. Responses in chronically
      instrumented rats were tested with hemorrhage and infusions of vasodilator and
      vasoconstrictor agents administered repeatedly over a period of 9 days. The
      results show that the system is capable of measuring CO chronically and provides 
      reproducible responses for periods of at least several weeks. We conclude that
      these methods provide a single, inexpensive, and accurate way to measure
      steady-state CO in conscious, unrestrained rats.

TI  - Cardiovascular actions of vasopressin: baroreflex modulation in the conscious
      rat.
PG  - H1244-51
AB  - Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and total
      peripheral resistance (TPR) were recorded during graded infusions of arginine
      vasopressin (AVP), angiotensin II (ANG II), and phenylephrine (PE) in conscious, 
      unrestrained, sinoaortic-denervated (SAD) and normal rats. Base-line MAP, CO, and
      TPR values before infusion were not different between groups. HR values were
      significantly higher in SAD rats. Dose-response curves indicated that there was a
      similar enhancement in pressor sensitivity to AVP, ANG II, and PE in the absence 
      of the baroreceptors. Pressor responses to AVP were buffered by offsetting
      decreases of CO. Similar elevations in MAP evoked a 50% greater reduction in CO
      with AVP, and HR decreased 1.5 times as much with AVP than with ANG II or PE. The
      dose of AVP required to raise MAP by 25 mmHg in control rats resulted in similar 
      falls of CO in SAD rats, whereas HR responses to AVP were attenuated
      significantly in SAD rats. We conclude that baroreceptor buffering of AVP-induced
      pressor responses is due principally to reflex reduction of TPR. Furthermore, CO 
      suppression was not baroreflex-mediated, whereas bradycardia was reflex
      dependent. Finally, in rats, AVP does not appear to interact with the
      baroreceptor reflexes in a manner unique from other vasoconstrictor agents to
      buffer MAP.

TI  - Ionomycin acts as an ionophore to release TRH-regulated Ca2+ stores from GH4C1
      cells.
PG  - C887-91
AB  - In the GH4C1 strain of rat pituitary cells, ionomycin, a divalent cation
      ionophore, induces a rapid and transient spike in cytosolic free Ca2+
      concentrations [( Ca2+]i) similar to that induced by the Ca2+-mobilizing hormone 
      thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). To test directly the hypothesis that
      ionomycin causes the spike in [Ca2+]i by altering cellular Ca2+ stores, we have
      measured ionomycin-induced changes in 45Ca2+ fluxes and have compared these to
      previously characterized changes induced by TRH. Ionomycin (half-maximal
      concentration = 30 nM) rapidly (within 1 min) induced a release into the medium
      of 50-60% of cell-associated 45Ca2+, paralleling the spike in [Ca2+]i. The
      ionomycin-induced 45Ca2+ efflux was greater than with TRH, and TRH did not induce
      further 45Ca2+ efflux in the presence of ionomycin. Ionomycin pretreatment
      blocked induction of the spike in [Ca2+]i elicited by TRH but did not alter basal
      or TRH-induced enhancement of inositol phosphate levels. These results provide
      evidence that the spike in [Ca2+]i induced by ionomycin or TRH is produced
      largely by release of Ca2+ into the cytosol from the same intracellular pool,
      followed by rapid extrusion of the released Ca2+ into the extracellular space.
      However, unlike TRH, ionomycin appears to release cellular Ca2+ directly, acting 
      as an ionophore, without the generation of known second messengers.

TI  - Vasopressin responses to corticotropin releasing factor and hyperosmolality in
      conscious dogs.
PG  - R1235-9
AB  - We recently reported that ovine corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) infusion in 
      conscious dogs elevated plasma vasopressin. The present study examines the
      vasopressin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol responses to CRF
      infusion (20 ng X kg-1 X min-1), to hypertonic saline infusion (NaCl 0.054 meq X 
      kg-1 X min-1), and to simultaneous coinfusion of CRF and NaCl (CRF + NaCl)
      without (no-dex) or with (dex-treated) dexamethasone pretreatment in six
      conscious dogs (6-8 experiments/dog). CRF had no significant effect on plasma
      sodium or osmolality, blood pressure, or heart rate. NaCl increased plasma sodium
      from 146 +/- 1 to 151 +/- 1 meq/l and plasma osmolality from 298 +/- 3 to 305 +/-
      3 mosmol/kg. Vasopressin increased significantly during CRF (2.1 +/- 0.5 to 4.8
      +/- 1.1 pg/ml) and NaCl (1.9 +/- 0.3 to 5.0 +/- 0.8 pg/ml). Coinfusion of CRF and
      NaCl resulted in a response larger than the sum of the two infusions alone (3.0
      +/- 1.6 to 31.4 +/- 18.5 pg/ml). The ACTH response to CRF (45 +/- 8 to 288 +/- 88
      pg/ml) was not augmented by coinfusion with NaCl. DEX attenuated the vasopressin 
      and ACTH responses to each infusion. We conclude that CRF-induced increases in
      vasopressin are augmented by a simultaneous osmotic stimulus. In addition, the
      plasma vasopressin responses to CRF and/or hypertonic saline infusion are
      inhibited by glucocorticoid pretreatment.

TI  - Na+-H+ exchanger of human placental brush-border membrane: identification and
      characterization.
PG  - C852-60
AB  - Syncytiotrophoblast brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from full-term human 
      placentas were shown to transport Na+ against a concentration gradient in the
      presence of an outward proton gradient [( H+i] greater than [H+]o). This proton
      gradient-coupled Na+ uptake was markedly inhibited and the uphill transport
      abolished when the electrochemical proton gradient was dissipated by
      carbonylcyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone. The presence of nigericin
      also eliminated the concentrative uptake of Na+ in these vesicles.
      Dimethylamiloride and harmaline inhibited the proton gradient-induced Na+ uptake.
      The apparent inhibition constant for this process was 0.32 microM for
      dimethylamiloride was freely reversible and the inhibitor reduced the Na+ uptake 
      by directly interacting with the exchanger protein rather than by dissipating the
      H+ gradient. The dimethylamiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake was saturable with
      respect to Na+. The affinity constant for Na+ was 7.8 +/- 1.2 mM and the maximal 
      velocity was 38.7 +/- 2.4 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1. The
      dimethylamiloride-insensitive Na+ uptake was not saturable and probably
      represented simple diffusion. The diffusional component accounted for only 10% of
      the total uptake. Li+ strongly competed with Na+ for the uptake process and the
      apparent inhibition constant was 3.6 +/- 0.4 mM. Tetraethylammonium also caused
      significant inhibition of Na+ uptake, whereas K+, Rb+, Cs+, and choline had no
      effect. These data provide evidence for the existence of a Na+-H+ exchanger in
      human placental brush-border membrane, and the properties of this exchanger are
      similar to those of the Na+-H+ exchanger identified in the brush-border membrane 
      of mammalian kidney and small intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Effects of hypertonic saline infusion and water drinking on atrial peptide.
PG  - R1091-4
AB  - This study was undertaken to define the changes in plasma levels of atrial
      natriuretic peptide (ANP) induced by hypertonic saline infusion followed by
      spontaneous water drinking and to determine whether these changes in ANP are
      correlated with changes in right atrial pressure (RAP) and plasma levels of
      vasopressin (AVP). Conscious dogs (n = 5) were infused with hypertonic saline
      (6%) at a rate of 1.4 ml/min for 4 h. Water was withheld for the first 2 h and
      administered ad libitum for the final 2 h. Hypertonic saline infusion induced
      increases (P less than 0.05) in plasma osmolality (posM), pAVP, mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), and RAP (1.9 +/- 0.6 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 mmHg). These changes were
      accompanied by an increase of pANP (68 +/- 14 to 120 +/- 33 pg/ml, P less than
      0.05). Spontaneous water drinking (1,410 +/- 127 ml) returned posM and pAVP to
      control levels and produced a further and significant increment in RAP (150%) and
      pANP (100%). During the water-drinking phase MAP was not further altered, and
      hematocrit decreased by 11.1% (P less than 0.05). A positive linear correlation
      (P less than 0.001) was found between increases in RAP and pANP. The
      administration of an AVP vasopressor antagonist in a similar protocol, and before
      hypertonic saline infusion, inhibited the increase of MAP, but it did not alter
      the changes of posM, hematocrit, RAP, nor pANP. These results suggest that
      changes in the release of ANP during increases in posM and after spontaneous
      water drinking are predominantly controlled by changes in RAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

PG  - 1525-32
AB  - To acquire information about the characteristics of U.S. citizens who had
      recently studied medicine abroad, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical 
      Graduates (ECFMG) and the Association of American Medical Colleges merged
      independently collected data on a study group of 10,460 U.S. citizens who
      attended 359 medical schools in 75 foreign countries and who took their first
      ECFMG examination between 1978 and 1982. The study group was markedly
      heterogeneous: 21 percent were not U.S. citizens at birth, 32 percent did not
      have English as a native language, and 12 percent had two or more years of
      undergraduate college education in Puerto Rico. Sixty-seven percent resided in
      New York, New Jersey, California, Florida, or Puerto Rico, and 74 percent studied
      medicine in Mexico or the Caribbean. Forty-six percent passed the ECFMG
      examination on their first attempt, and 22 percent passed a subsequent
      examination. Only 45 percent had applied to a U.S. medical school, and 65 percent
      had taken the Medical College Admission Test. The means of the college
      grade-point averages, known for 39 percent of the study group, and of the scores 
      on the admission test, known for 65 percent, were lower than those of both
      accepted and unaccepted applicants to U.S. medical schools in the 1976 and 1978
      entering classes. The finding that 55 percent of the study group did not apply to
      a U.S. medical school does not support the widely held belief that most, if not
      all, U.S. citizens who attend foreign medical schools do so only after several
      unsuccessful attempts to gain admission to a U.S. school.

TI  - Appendectomy and the risk of tubal infertility.
PG  - 1506-8
AB  - We studied the importance of a history of appendectomy for appendicitis in 279
      women with laparoscopically or surgically diagnosed tubal infertility and a
      control group of 957 fertile women. After controlling for the effects of age, use
      of an intrauterine device for contraception, a history of pelvic inflammatory
      disease, and other potential confounding variables, we found that no excess risk 
      of tubal infertility was associated with a simple appendectomy without rupture.
      However, when the operation was reportedly for a ruptured appendix, the relative 
      risk of tubal infertility was 4.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.9)
      for women who had never been pregnant and 3.2 (95 percent confidence interval,
      1.1 to 9.6) for women with one or more previous pregnancies. We conclude that the
      early diagnosis and treatment of suspected appendicitis in girls and women of
      reproductive age may reduce the incidence of tubal infertility resulting from the
      sequelae of a ruptured appendix.

TI  - Effect of mutations at the lariat branch acceptor site on beta-globin pre-mRNA
      splicing in vitro.
PG  - 589-91
AB  - Introns are excised from full-length transcripts (pre-messenger RNAs) of
      eukaryotic genes in two steps. First, the pre-mRNA is cleaved at the 5' splice
      site and a branched (lariat) intermediate is formed. Then, cleavage at the 3'
      splice site and ligation of the two exons leads to the release of the lariat
      intron. The intron sequence which accepts the 5' end to form the lariat branch is
      strictly conserved in yeast, but shows more variation in eukaryotes. To
      investigate the requirements for branch formation in eukaryotes further, we have 
      studied in vitro splicing of a rabbit globin gene intron with mutations of the
      normal branch-accepting adenosine nucleotide. We conclude that all four
      nucleotides can serve as branch acceptors, but that A and C are preferred to G
      and U in lariat formation. Mutation of the normal A to G or U can lead to an A
      residue one nucleotide upstream of the normal branch site being used instead.
      Only branches to A or C participate efficiently in the second splicing step.

TI  - 13-cis-retinoic acid in the treatment of oral leukoplakia.
PG  - 1501-5
AB  - 13-cis-Retinoic acid has been reported to be effective in treating oral
      leukoplakia. We randomly assigned 44 patients with this disease to receive
      13-cis-retinoic acid (24 patients) or placebo (20), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of
      body weight per day for three months, and followed them for six months. There
      were major decreases in the size of the lesions in 67 percent (16 patients) of
      those given the drug and in 10 percent (2 patients) of those given placebo (P =
      0.0002); dysplasia was reversed in 54 percent (13 patients) of the drug group and
      in 10 percent (2 patients) of the placebo group (P = 0.01). The clinical response
      to the drug correlated with the histologic response in 56 percent (9 of 16) of
      the patients evaluated. Relapse occurred in 9 of 16 patients two to three months 
      after treatment ended. The toxic effects of the drug were acceptable in all but
      two patients. Cheilitis, facial erythema, and dryness and peeling of the skin
      were common; conjunctivitis and hypertriglyceridemia also occurred. All adverse
      reactions could be reversed by reducing the dose or temporarily discontinuing the
      drug. We conclude that 13-cis-retinoic acid, even in short-term use, appears to
      be an effective treatment for oral leukoplakia and has an acceptable level of
      toxicity.

TI  - Recombination between immunoglobulin variable region gene segments is enhanced by
      transcription.
PG  - 585-9
AB  - Immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region genes are assembled in precursor B
      (pre-B) lymphocytes from multiple germline segments. The heavy-chain V-region
      gene is composed of variable (VH), diversity (D) and joining (JH) segments; kappa
      (K) and lambda (lambda) light-chain V-region genes have analogous VL and JL
      segments. Assembly of Ig V-gene segments, as well as those of the highly related 
      T-cell receptor, is regulated at several levels and shows both stage and tissue
      specificity; for example Ig heavy-chain V-gene assembly precedes that of Ig light
      chains during B-cell differentiation. Joining of all classes of V-gene segments
      involves conserved recognition sequences that are probably targets for a common
      recombinase. Evidence has been presented suggesting that rearrangement of
      specific classes of segments is regulated by modulation of their accessibility to
      the recombinase. To elucidate mechanisms which control V-region gene assembly, we
      have investigated the effect of flanking gene expression on the frequency at
      which introduced V-gene segments are assembled in pre-B cell lines. Our findings 
      suggest that transcription may play a direct role in the regulation of
      immunoglobulin V-gene assembly.

TI  - H-2-restricted cytolytic T cells specific for HLA can recognize a synthetic HLA
      peptide.
PG  - 578-9
AB  - It is generally accepted that T lymphocytes recognize antigens in the context of 
      molecules encoded by genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC
      class II-restricted T cells usually recognize degraded or denatured rather than
      native forms of antigen on the surface of class II-bearing antigen presenting
      cells. It has recently been shown that short synthetic peptides corresponding to 
      mapped antigenic sites of the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) can render uninfected 
      target cells susceptible to lysis by NP-specific class I-restricted cytolytic T
      cells (CTL). These and earlier experiments that showed specific recognition of NP
      deletion mutant transfectants suggest that class I-restricted recognition might
      also involve processed antigenic fragments. One important issue arising from
      these studies is whether the model applies not only to viral proteins that are
      expressed internally (such as NP) but also to antigens normally expressed as
      integral membrane proteins at the cell surface. We have recently isolated class
      I-restricted mouse CTL clones that recognize class I gene products of the human
      MHC (HLA) as antigens in mouse cell HLA-transfectants. Here we show that these
      anti-HLA CTL can lyse HLA-negative syngeneic mouse cells in the presence of a
      synthetic HLA peptide. These results suggest that the model applies generally.

TI  - Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize influenza haemagglutinin that lacks a signal
      sequence.
PG  - 575-7
AB  - A surprising feature of most cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responding to
      influenza infection is that they recognize the unglycosylated (non-transmembrane)
      proteins of the virus, including the nucleoprotein. Recognition of cells that
      express nucleoprotein by CTL does not depend on a definite signal sequence within
      the protein, and the epitopes recognized can be defined with short synthetic
      peptides in vitro. Haemagglutinin (HA), the major transmembrane protein of the
      virus, is recognized by a minor population of CTL from infected mice. We have
      deleted the sequence coding for the N-terminal signal peptide from a
      complementary DNA encoding HA of the H1 subtype. The signal-deleted HA is
      detected with antibodies as a short-lived, unglycosylated, intracellular protein.
      However, CTL raised to the complete molecule recognize cells expressing the
      signal-deleted HA and vice versa. These results cast doubts on the assumption
      that CTL recognize the HA molecule only after its insertion into the plasma
      membrane.

      virus infection. An update.
PG  - 1562-4
AB  - HIV is not readily transmitted to health care workers, even after accidental
      parenteral exposure to infected blood. Existing guidelines for reducing exposure 
      to blood and other body fluids will protect workers who care for patients
      infected with this pathogen. New infection-control guidelines for patients with
      AIDS are therefore not required. Awareness of the potential for nosocomial
      transmission of HIV has resulted in a renewed respect for the principles and
      practice of infection control. The procedures that the task force recommended to 
      prevent contact with body fluids will reduce exposure not only to HIV but also to
      other potentially contagious pathogens in the health care environment.
      Implementation and enforcement of these guidelines for all patients could greatly
      reduce the incidence of nosocomial and occupationally acquired infections.

TI  - Long-range restriction map around the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene.
PG  - 582-5
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disease affecting about 1 in
      4,000 newborn boys. As in many other inherited diseases, the biochemical basis of
      the condition is unknown, and as yet there is no effective treatment.
      Translocations, deletions and other mutations leading to the DMD phenotype are
      distributed over a chromosomal area of large, but unknown size. Using
      pulsed-field gradient gel electrophoresis, we have now determined restriction
      maps of a major fraction of this area, covering two regions of three million
      basepairs in total, and used it to determine the position of several probes
      linked to DMD. The maps establish physical distances between structural changes
      associated with the DMD phenotype and provide evidence for a CpG-rich island
      proximal to the area containing translocations and deletions associated with the 
      DMD phenotype.

      lymphocytes.
PG  - 579-82
AB  - The development from stem cells to pre-B cells, B lymphocytes and, finally,
      plasma cells and memory cells proceeds through various stages which have been
      defined by the genomic context in which immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) and light
      (L) chain gene segments are found, as well as by their state of expression. They 
      have also been identified by surface marker analysis and susceptibility to
      various stimuli regulating growth and differentiation. We have searched for genes
      that are expressed at given stages in the B-lymphocyte development pathway and
      which might function to control this development at various stages. A
      complementary DNA sequence called pZ183 was found in a library constructed from
      messenger RNA of the murine pre-B lymphoma cell line 70Z/3 which is selectively
      expressed in pre-B cells. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone 
      (pZ183-1) containing 0.7 kilobases (kb) of the pZ183 gene. Part of this sequence 
      shows strong homology to constant (C) and joining (J) region sequences of lambda 
      1 L chains. Our findings define a new immunoglobulin L-chain-related locus, which
      we call lambda 5, that is selectively transcribed in pre-B lymphocytes.

TI  - Apolipoprotein B-gene DNA polymorphisms associated with myocardial infarction.
PG  - 1509-15
AB  - Levels of apolipoprotein B, the protein component of low-density lipoproteins,
      correlate with the risk of coronary heart disease. We examined whether genetic
      variation in apolipoprotein B is associated with myocardial infarction by
      studying apolipoprotein B-gene restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms in 84
      patients with myocardial infarction and an equal number of matched controls.
      Southern blot analysis with apolipoprotein B-gene probes, performed after DNA was
      digested with the endonucleases XbaI and EcoRI, revealed alleles that we
      designated as X1, X2, and X3 and as R1 and R2, respectively. Similar studies with
      the endonuclease MspI revealed alleles of many different sizes (the difference
      was due to an insertion-deletion polymorphism), which we grouped as larger and
      smaller alleles and designated as ID1 and ID2, respectively. The frequencies of
      the X1, R1, and ID1 alleles were all significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in
      the cases than in the controls. None of the alleles, however, was significantly
      associated with variation in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or
      apolipoprotein B, and the functional importance of these alleles is therefore
      uncertain. Nonetheless, in addition to quantitative variation in apolipoprotein B
      levels in plasma, genetic variation at the apolipoprotein B locus may be a new
      and independent risk factor for myocardial infarction.

TI  - A prospective study of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, mortality, and
      cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 1519-24
AB  - It has been postulated that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester, 
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), the major secretory products of the human
      adrenal gland, may be discriminators of life expectancy and aging. We examined
      the relation of base-line circulating DHEAS levels to subsequent 12-year
      mortality from any cause, from cardiovascular disease, and from ischemic heart
      disease in a population-based cohort of 242 men aged 50 to 79 years at the start 
      of the study. Mean DHEAS levels decreased with age and were also significantly
      lower in men with a history of heart disease than in those without such a
      history. In men with no history of heart disease at base line, the age-adjusted
      relative risk associated with a DHEAS level below 140 micrograms per deciliter
      was 1.5 (P not significant) for death from any causes, 3.3 (P less than 0.05) for
      death from cardiovascular disease, and 3.2 (P less than 0.05) for death from
      ischemic heart disease. In multivariate analyses, an increase in DHEAS level of
      100 micrograms per deciliter was associated with a 36 percent reduction in
      mortality from any causes (P less than 0.05) and a 48 percent reduction in
      mortality from cardiovascular disease (P less than 0.05), after adjustment for
      age, systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, obesity, fasting plasma
      glucose level, cigarette smoking status, and personal history of heart disease.
      Our conclusions are limited by the single determination of DHEAS levels, but the 
      data suggest that the DHEAS concentration is independently and inversely related 
      to death from any cause and death from cardiovascular disease in men over age 50.

TI  - The correct activation of Antennapedia and bithorax complex genes requires the
      fushi tarazu gene.
PG  - 592-7
AB  - In the Drosophila embryo the establishment and specification of metameric units
      depends upon the selective activation of the segmentation and the homoeotic
      selector genes. The former are necessary for establishing the appropriate number 
      of metameric or parasegmental units, whereas the latter control the pathways of
      differentiation followed by particular parasegments. Classical embryological
      manipulations have show n that these processes must be closely coordinated during
      normal development. However, previous studies of pair-rule genes have led to the 
      suggestion that the specification of segmental identity proceeds independently of
      the establishment of metameres as physical units. These apparently conflicting
      perspectives can be reconciled by envisaging a common maternally derived
      positional information system which is independently interpreted by the
      components of both processes. In the case of the partitioning process, the gap
      and pair-rule genes would be instrumental in translating this information,
      whereas the activation of the homeotic genes would be mediated via other
      intermediaries (see ref. 9 for review). It is difficult to see, however, how such
      a system could ensure the precise regulation of the tw o types of genes implicit 
      in the final differentiated pattern. This difficulty has led to the suggestion
      that the segmentation mechanism must define the precise boundaries of selector
      gene expression. Here we confirm this suggestion and propose that the gene fushi 
      tarazu plays a key role in this process, integrating the processes of metameric
      partitioning and regional specification in the Drosophila embryo.

TI  - Cholinergic neurones acquire adrenergic neurotransmitters when transplanted into 
      an embryo.
PG  - 569-72
AB  - During development, cells become progressively restricted, until they reach their
      final phenotype. Differentiation was originally thought to be irreversible, but
      phenotypic plasticity has been observed in a variety of cell types, for example
      sympathetic neurones, the limb blastema and some glial cell types. A detailed
      description of the individual steps that lead to expression or reversal of
      phenotype is essential to understand the molecular events underlying cell
      differentiation. We examined whether ciliary neurones acquire adrenergic
      properties when exposed to a permissive embryonic environment. Cholinergic
      neurones were selectively labelled with a retrogradely transported marker and
      injected into chick embryos during active neural crest migration. Four to five
      days after injection, some of the labelled neurones were found in 'adrenergic
      sites' and had developed catecholamine histofluorescence. The cells had thus
      accumulated adrenergic neurotransmitters even after differentiation into
      cholinergic neurones. This result shows that neurotransmitter plasticity occurs
      in cholinergic neurones and suggests that the neurotransmitter phenotype can be
      modified by the embryonic environment.

TI  - Variable and conserved neutralization antigens of human immunodeficiency virus.
PG  - 572-5
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, HTLV-III/LAV), the retrovirus
      responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), shows a high degree
      of genetic polymorphism, particularly in the env gene. We have examined sera from
      rabbits and guinea pigs immunized with gp130, a recombinant env glycoprotein, and
      sera from HIV-1-infected subjects, to test their capacity to neutralize a panel
      of genetically divergent HIV-1 isolates. The sera raised against recombinant
      antigen specifically neutralized the virus strain from which the env gene was
      cloned (HTLV-IIIB), but not an independent isolate (HTLV-IIIRF). One rabbit serum
      tested on seven isolates cross-neutralized two at lower titres. In contrast,
      human sera from Britain and Uganda, chosen for ability to neutralize HTLV-IIIRF, 
      cross-neutralized six other HIV-1 isolates. When serum and isolate were derived
      from the same subject, the serum was in some cases effective at slightly lower
      concentrations (higher titres). Human complement did not affect neutralization
      titres. These findings indicate that genetically diverse HIV-1 isolates carry
      both variable and widely conserved antigenic epitopes for neutralizing
      antibodies. The identification of shared epitopes may help the development of
      protective vaccines.

TI  - Eosinophiluria--a new method of detection and definition of the clinical
      spectrum.
PG  - 1516-9
AB  - Eosinophiluria is considered a useful marker of drug-induced acute interstitial
      nephritis. However, recognition of eosinophiluria by Wright's staining is
      technically difficult, and the spectrum of disorders causing eosinophiluria is
      not completely defined. We have adapted Hansel's stain for the examination of
      urinary sediment. Whereas there was a variable uptake of Wright's stain by
      eosinophils in the urine, such eosinophils were readily recognized with Hansel's 
      stain by the presence of bright red granules. The prevalence of eosinophiluria in
      acute interstitial nephritis was 10 of 11 patients, in acute tubular necrosis
      none of 30, in acute pyelonephritis none of 10, in acute cystitis 1 of 15, in
      postinfectious glomerulonephritis 1 of 6, in rapidly progressive
      glomerulonephritis 4 of 10, and in acute prostatitis 6 of 10. Eosinophiluria in
      acute interstitial nephritis was demonstrated by Hansel's stain in 10 of 11
      patients but by Wright's stain in only 2 of 11 patients. We conclude that
      Hansel's stain substantially improves the recognition of eosinophiluria as
      compared with Wright's stain. Eosinophiluria is useful in distinguishing acute
      interstitial nephritis from acute tubular necrosis. The clinical spectrum of
      eosinophiluria also includes rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, acute
      prostatitis, and occasionally, acute cystitis or postinfectious
      glomerulonephritis.

TI  - Nipecotic acid: preferential accumulation in the cochlea by GABA uptake systems
      and selective retrograde transport to brainstem.
PG  - 399-403
AB  - [3H]Nipecotic acid was shown to be preferentially accumulated by the same
      cochlear structures which selectively accumulate [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid
      ([3H]-GABA), including the terminals of a subset of olivocochlear neurons. With
      both amino acids, olivocochlear fibers selectively transported label in a
      retrograde direction, from cochlea to brainstem. However, only [3H]nipecotic acid
      produced dense labeling, and labeling of cell bodies in the superior olive,
      presumably because it is metabolized very slowly. Nipecotic acid appears to
      provide a selective retrograde tracer, specific to neurons whose terminals
      exhibit preferential GABA uptake.

TI  - Decreased phosphorylation of synaptic glycoproteins following hippocampal
      kindling.
PG  - 390-4
AB  - Rats with chronic electrode implants to region CA3 of the hippocampus were
      rapidly kindled by stimulation with a 10 s, 10 Hz train of biphasic square waves 
      presented every 5 min, until generalized seizures developed (60-70 stimulations).
      The hippocampi were isolated from the brains of control animals (implanted but
      not stimulated), and experimental animals which had developed generalized
      seizures. Synaptic membranes (SM) were prepared. SM were incubated with
      [gamma-32P]ATP and the incorporation of 32P into proteins and glycoproteins
      isolated by affinity chromatography on concanavalin-A-agarose was investigated.
      There was no difference in the phosphorylation pattern of total SM proteins
      between groups. In contrast, the phosphorylation of a glycoprotein with an
      apparent molecular weight of 180,000 was decreased 20-40% in kindled animals.
      This result was replicated in three independent experiments. The results suggest 
      that the phosphorylation of glycoprotein 180 may be related to neuroplastic
      events.

TI  - Entorhinal lesions result in increased nerve growth factor-like growth-promoting 
      activity in medium conditioned by hippocampal slices.
PG  - 383-9
AB  - Nerve growth factor (NGF) is present in high concentrations in the rat
      hippocampal formation where it may be involved in sympathetic sprouting following
      septohippocampal denervation. In addition, recent evidence suggests that some
      forebrain cholinergic neurons, including septohippocampal neurons, are responsive
      to exogenous NGF. Since septohippocampal neurons have been shown to sprout in
      response to entorhinal lesions both in rats and, recently, in humans, we sought
      to determine whether endogenous NGF-like activity increases in the rat
      hippocampal formation following injury to the entorhinal cortex. We found that
      entorhinal lesions which result in extensive denervation of the dentate granule
      cells, and subsequent sprouting of septohippocampal axons, do result in greater
      NGF-like growth-promoting activity in medium conditioned by slices of the
      denervated tissue when compared to medium conditioned by control tissue. These
      results suggest that brain NGF may be involved in injury-induced sprouting of
      forebrain cholinergic neurons.

PG  - 379-82
AB  - Prepuberal female rats (25 days of age) were injected with estradiol benzoate (EB
      10 micrograms/rat, s.c. in oil) or oil vehicle. Forty-eight hours after
      treatment, all animals were decapitated, their brains removed and sectioned. The 
      arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and median eminence were microdissected and
      processed for isoelectric focusing followed by slab gel electrophoresis. The
      resulting two-dimensional electrophoretic gels were analyzed to quantitate the
      specific proteins resolved using a scanning microdensitometric method. Out of 235
      proteins measured, 8 proteins were found to be significantly increased and 4 were
      decreased by EB treatment. The proteins which increased in concentration ranged
      in molecular weight from 15 to 43 kDa and isoelectric points (pI) of 4.9 to 7.0. 
      The 4 proteins decreased by the EB treatment were 44, 67, 74 and 80 kDa in
      molecular weight and their pI's ranged from 6.5 to 7.1. It is suggested that
      these proteins might be involved in some of the neuroendocrine effects that are
      induced by estradiol in this region of the brain.

TI  - Cell bodies of origin of serotonin-immunoreactive afferents to the inferior
      olivary complex of the rat.
PG  - 369-73
AB  - Previous studies have used immunohistochemistry to localize serotonin to distinct
      olivary nuclei in several mammalian species. However, the location of the cell
      bodies of origin for the serotoninergic projection to the inferior olive in any
      of these species was unknown. In the present study, a paradigm which combines
      transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and serotonin immunohistochemistry
      (PAP) was used to identify the cell bodies of origin of this afferent system to
      the inferior olivary complex of the rat. Cells which contain both retrogradely
      transported HRP and brown cytoplasmic staining indicating that they are
      serotoninergic cells that project to the inferior olivary complex are found
      exclusively in an area dorsal to the rostrolateral dorsal accessory olive within 
      the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis. Neurons within this nucleus were
      also found to be a source of serotoninergic afferents to the cerebellum and
      spinal cord of the rat. This raises the possibility that individual
      serotonin-immunoreactive neurons within this nucleus may project to all 3 areas. 
      Future studies will be designed to address this possibility. No double-labeled
      cells were observed within any of the raphe nuclei.

TI  - Nucleus basalis of Meynert neuronal activity during a delayed response task in
      monkey.
PG  - 364-8
AB  - A total of 183 nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) neurons were recorded in a monkey
      performing a delayed response task. Significant changes in discharge rate were
      detected in 74% of the NBM cells sampled with most responses occurring in the
      choice (64%) or the reward (67%) epochs of the task. Neuronal responses in the
      cueing epoch were less common (31%) and less robust than in the choice epoch,
      although the animal made essentially the same arm movement in both cases. Only
      14% of the task-related NBM cells had significant changes in discharge rate in
      the delay period, and none of these responded differentially for the two
      positions indicated in the preceding cueing epoch. These findings do not support 
      a role of the NBM in the differential responses of cortical neurons in delayed
      response tasks, but they provide further evidence for NBM involvement in aspects

TI  - Retraction and degeneration of sympathetic neurites in response to locally
      elevated potassium.
PG  - 357-63
AB  - Sympathetic neurons from superior cervical ganglia of newborn rats were plated
      into center compartments of 3-compartment culture dishes, allowing exposure of
      distal neurites to media of different composition than provided to cell bodies
      and proximal neurites. Cultures were maintained initially with an external
      potassium concentration ([K+]o) of either 5 mM in all compartments or 50 mM in
      all compartments. After neurites had elongated into distal compartments, the
      culture medium was changed such that: the cell bodies and proximal neurites were 
      exposed to 5 mM [K+]o; the distal neurites in one side compartment of each
      culture were also exposed to 5 mM [K+]o; but the distal neurites in the opposite 
      side compartment were exposed to 50 mM [K+]o. During the next 7-10 days, the
      distal neurites locally exposed to 50 mM [K+]o degenerated. Many neurites
      developed a stretched appearance before degenerating, and detailed observations
      suggest that the neurites retracted to the point where mechanical tension
      exceeded their strength and then abruptly disintegrated. Neurites in opposite
      side compartments exposed to 5 mM [K+]o were normal in appearance and did not
      degenerate. These results suggest that a proximo-distal increase in [K+]o causes 
      an extreme retraction of neurites distal to the increase. These results raise the
      possibility that K+ released by active nerve endings might cause the retraction
      of inactive nerve endings, thus providing a possible mechanism for the influence 
      of activity on competition for synaptic sites, a pervasive phenomenon in the
      developing nervous system.

      sleep-waking cycle and their responses to sensory stimuli.
PG  - 317-26
AB  - Spontaneous activity of the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) neurons during the
      sleep-waking cycle and effects of sensory stimuli upon NRD neurons were studied
      in cats. Seventy-one neurons recorded within the NRD were classified into two
      groups with the use of the coefficient of variation of firing intervals during
      waking (W): 41 regularly firing (clock-like) and 30 irregularly firing
      (non-clock-like) neurons. The majority of clock-like and one-third of
      non-clock-like neurons showed a decrease in their firing rate during slow-wave
      sleep (SWS) compared with W. All neurons of both types displayed their lowest
      level of activity during paradoxical sleep. During the late phase of SWS, many
      clock-like neurons reduced their firing prior to the occurrence of
      pontogeniculo-occipital waves, whereas non-clock-like neurons did not show such a
      specific property. Clock-like neurons were totally unresponsive to nociceptive
      and non-nociceptive somesthetic stimuli, while about half of the non-clock-like
      neurons were driven by these stimuli. Half of the clock-like and one-third of the
      non-clock-like neurons were driven by click stimulation, and the majority of them
      showed an excitatory response. Some of the clock-like and non-clock-like neurons 
      exhibited inhibitory and excitatory response to flash stimulation, respectively. 
      The results of this experiment show that two types of neurons do exist in the NRD
      and suggest that they play a functionally different role in the brain.

AB  - The 28,000-Da vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein, CaBP, which is induced
      by one hormonally active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, was
      localized by immunocytochemistry in the human brainstem, cerebellum and cervical 
      segment of the spinal cord. Positive structures (neurons and their processes)
      were restricted to some well-defined motor and sensory pathways. In motor
      regions, the highest density of immunoreactive sites was found in the Purkinje
      cell layer of the cerebellar cortex, and CaBP-positive neurons were also found in
      the reticular formation and the inferior olivary nucleus. In sensory pathways,
      positive neurons were mainly localized in structures associated with protopathic 
      thermalgesia (pain and temperature), as well as in the solitary nucleus and
      parabrachial nucleus of the taste pathway.

TI  - Active properties of dendritic membrane examined by current source density
      analysis in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - The laminar profile of extracellular field potentials evoked by alveus or stratum
      radiatum stimulation was recorded at the CA1 region of guinea pig hippocampal
      slices. One-dimensional approximation of the current source density analysis
      method was applied to the data. When the alveus was stimulated, the location of
      inward membrane current (sink) moved from the cell body layer to the dendritic
      region for a distance of at least 200 micron at a velocity of 0.16 +/- 0.03 m/s
      (n = 6). This sink movement was not blocked by either low- Ca2+ or
      Ca2+-free/high-Mg2+ medium, but was blocked by tetrodotoxin application
      restricted to the dendritic region by a local perfusion method. When the stratum 
      radiatum was stimulated, sink movement from the dendritic region to the cell body
      layer was not distinct. Retrograde sink movement from the cell body layer to the 
      dendritic region subsequent to the cell body spike was not observed. These
      findings indicated that the dendrites of the CA1 pyramidal neurons can generate
      action potentials which propagate along the dendrite and that they might
      primarily be mediated by Na ion.

TI  - Effects of androgens and estrogens on the vasopressin and oxytocin innervation of
      the adult rat brain.
PG  - 296-302
AB  - Recently we reported that castration of rats eliminates vasopressin
      immunoreactivity in the lateral septum and other areas that appear to receive
      vasopressin innervation from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.
      Testosterone treatment counteracts this effect of castration. In the present
      study, we investigated whether this action of testosterone depends on its
      androgenic or estrogenic metabolites by treating long-term castrated rats with
      estradiol (E) and/or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or testosterone. The
      brains were then processed for immunocytochemistry or radioimmunoassay. DHT did
      not increase vasopressin staining in the lateral septum, although it fully
      restored the size of the seminal vesicles. E did restore the original fiber
      density, but individual fibers stained more weakly than in sham-operated males.
      Only treatment with both E and DHT fully restored the vasopressin innervation.
      This pattern was also reflected in the radioimmunoassay data. The vasopressin
      content of the lateral septum decreased about 90% after castration but was fully 
      restored by either testosterone or E + DHT treatment. E alone, however, was only 
      half as effective as E + DHT. The treatments had no effect on the oxytocin
      content of the septum, or on the vasopressin or oxytocin content of the dorsal
      vagal complex. The results suggest that E mediates most of the effects of
      testosterone on the vasopressin innervation of the lateral septum. DHT enhances
      the response to E but has little effect on its own.

TI  - A comparative study on characterization and distribution of cholecystokinin
      binding sites among the rat, mouse and guinea pig brain.
PG  - 271-81
AB  - Using the in vitro quantitative receptor autoradiographical technique,
      [propionyl-3H]propionylated cholecystokinin octapeptide ([3H]pCCK-8) binding
      sites were investigated in tissue sections of rat, mouse and guinea pig brains.
      In all the tested animals, [3H]pCCK-8 bound very slowly to the tissue sections.
      Dissociation was also slow, and had a biphasic profile suggesting CCK-8 binding
      sites are heterogeneous. Dissociation rate constants were, however, unequal among
      these species. In the saturation binding studies, both Bmax and (Kd)app values
      varied among the animal species. The autoradiograms revealed marked species
      differences in [3H]pCCK-8 binding sites in the brain among 3 closely related
      species of rodents. [3H]pCCK-8 binding sites were undetectable in the nucleus
      accumbens/caudate-putamen and the amygdaloid complex of the mouse brain, and
      scarcely found in the ventromedialis of the hypothalamus of the mouse and guinea 
      pig brain. Furthermore, moderate-to-high densities of [3H]pCCK-8 binding sites
      were observed in the cerebella of the mouse and guinea pig, whereas in the rat
      cerebellum the binding sites were undetected. The above-mentioned observations
      suggest the existence of species differences in the binding pattern of CCK-like
      peptides among closely related animal species. Furthermore, it would appear that 
      CCK-like peptides in the brain may play different physiological roles among
      animal species.

      neurons in the nucleus raphe dorsalis of freely moving cats in relation to the
      cardiac cycle.
PG  - 262-70
AB  - Single unit activity of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the nucleus raphe dorsalis
      (NRD) and of noradrenergic (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) was recorded 
      in relation to the cardiac cycle in awake, freely moving cats. The discharge of
      NRD-5-HT neurons showed no relationship to the cardiac cycle, while LC-NE neurons
      displayed a cardiac periodicity such that the units were most likely to fire from
      80 to 180 ms after the peak of the cardiac r-wave (diastole), and least likely to
      fire during the period from 40 ms before to 60 ms after the r-wave (systole). The
      strength of this periodicity was inversely related to the discharge rate of
      individual cells. Exposure to a noxious environmental stimulus (15 min of 100 dB 
      white noise) greatly attenuated the cardiac relationship of LC-NE neurons. A
      blood volume expansion of approximately 15% (9.0 ml/kg b. wt.) decreased unit
      rate by about 25%, but did not alter either the timing or the magnitude of the
      LC-NE cardiac relationship. These data are discussed in terms of the
      participation of NRD-5-HT and LC-NE neurons in cardiovascular function, and the
      possible role of LC-NE neurons in short- and long-term volume homeostasis.

      effects of N-ethylmaleimide.
PG  - 232-9
AB  - Binding sites for N-ethylcarboxamido[3H]adenosine (NECA) in rat brain membranes
      and cryostat sections were examined in relation to their sensitivities to
      displacement by unlabeled NECA and R(-)-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA). In
      membrane fractions from cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum,
      nanomolar concentrations of these adenosine receptor agonists displaced [3H]NECA 
      such that R-PIA was more effective than NECA, consistent with the presence of an 
      A1-adenosine receptor. At concentrations of displacing agent higher than 1
      microM, R-PIA was unable to displace [3H]NECA further in cerebral cortex,
      cerebellum and hippocampus. In striatum, a second R-PIA-sensitive component of
      [3H]NECA binding was evident which was more sensitive to NECA than to R-PIA, i.e.
      it showed the characteristics of an A2-adenosine receptor. In striatum, however, 
      R-PIA was also unable to displace [3H]NECA binding completely. Similar results
      were obtained in quantitative autoradiographic studies. Preincubation of cryostat
      sections with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) abolished both the A1- and R-PIA-insensitive
      binding components such that both NECA and R-PIA were able to displace [3H]NECA
      binding completely. The remaining sites showed IC50 values of 0.13 and 3.68
      microM for NECA and R-PIA, respectively. These A2-like [3H]NECA binding sites had
      a highly specific distribution in the brain, being concentrated in the striatum, 
      nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The results indicate the presence in
      brain tissue of at least 3 classes of [3H]NECA binding sites, an A1-site, an
      A2-site and a third, unidentified R-PIA-insensitive site.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of cerebellar lesions on respiration in the spontaneously
      breathing, anesthetized cat.
PG  - 224-31
AB  - Acute cerebellectomy depressed spontaneous respiration in cats anesthetized with 
      chloralose-urethane. After cerebellectomy there was an increased interbreath
      interval (TTOT) accompanied by increased inspiratory and expiratory durations (TI
      and TE, respectively). However, the change of TE exceeded that of TI so that
      TI/TTOT decreased. Tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) were not
      affected. No respiratory variable was significantly altered when cerebellectomy
      was performed subsequent to bilateral vagotomy. Bilateral lesions of the rostral 
      fastigial nuclei (FN) in cats with intact vagi also caused a reduction in
      ventilation due to increased TTOT. In this case TI and VT/TI increased, but VT
      and TI/TTOT remained unchanged. Bilateral control lesions that usually included
      portions of the dentate nuclei did not influence respiration. The results suggest
      that in the anesthetized cat the cerebellum tonically excites respiratory centers
      controlling respiratory rate and the termination of inspiration. A part of this
      influence may be mediated by the rostral FN. In addition, vagal input appears to 
      be important in the expression of the cerebellar influence on spontaneous
      respiration.

TI  - Direct relation of long-term synaptic potentiation to phosphorylation of membrane
      protein F1, a substrate for membrane protein kinase C.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - One hour after long-term potentiation (LTP) in the intact hippocampus, a
      selective increase in protein F1 in vitro phosphorylation was observed in
      homogenate prepared from dorsal hippocampus. Protein F1 phosphorylation was
      directly related to the magnitude and persistence of potentiation. No other
      phosphoprotein studied exhibited a relationship with synaptic enhancement.
      Low-frequency, non-potentiating stimulation did not increase protein F1
      phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of F1 was not elevated when high-frequency
      stimulation did not produce potentiation. We also confirmed our earlier
      demonstration of a similar pattern of results 5 min after LTP. In related work we
      have previously observed: that protein F1 is a substrate for protein kinase C
      (PKC); that membrane PKC activity was increased by translocation from the cytosol
      following LTP; and that membrane PKC activity was directly related to the
      persistence of enhancement. We therefore predicted in the present study that
      protein F1 phosphorylation in a dorsal hippocampal membrane fraction would be
      related to LTP. Hippocampal membrane protein F1 was found to be directly related 
      to both the magnitude and persistence of response enhancement. Thus the molecular
      events leading to prolonged potentiation may involve increased PKC/protein F1
      association. Persistence of potentiation may be related to synaptic growth
      processes involving the growth-associated function of protein F1.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase activity was assayed in the absence and presence of
      pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. If substrate hydrolysis was measured by the pH-stat
      method, its rate was not significantly affected by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. In the
      spectrophotometric assay, however, this compound led to an apparent decrease in
      rate. The discrepancy between the two assays is explained by stray-light
      artefacts produced by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at the wavelengths of the
      spectrophotometric assay.

TI  - Determination of peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase activity using a
      lauroyl-CoA-based fluorometric assay.
PG  - 585-93
AB  - A simple, sensitive fluorometric method for the determination of peroxisomal
      fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (EC 1.3.99.3) activity has been developed. Studies of
      enzyme activity relative to subcellular distribution and to clofibrate induction 
      indicate that this assay is specific for peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase. The 
      lauroyl-CoA-dependent production of H2O2 is quantitated by measuring the
      oxidation of 4-hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid to a fluorescent product in a
      horseradish peroxidase-coupled assay. Assays can be performed in either a fixed
      time or continuous mode. In either mode, H2O2 production is related to a change
      in fluorescence intensity through use of a standard curve generated with known
      amounts of H2O2. The use of lauroyl-CoA (12:0), rather than the more generally
      used substrate palmitoyl-CoA (16:0), provides significant advantages. Much of the
      substrate inhibition problem associated with palmitoyl-CoA has been avoided, and 
      a greater than 4.5-fold higher specific activity has been achieved compared with 
      a palmitoyl-CoA-based assay. In the fixed-time mode, linearity relative to time
      and to the amount of enzyme added has been established without resorting to the
      use of bovine serum albumin as a substrate binding medium. Sensitivity is
      estimated to be at least equal to that of the most sensitive methods reported,
      while reliability, versatility and range have been improved. Use of this method
      should greatly facilitate the study of peroxisomal beta-oxidation regulatory
      mechanisms in hepatocyte cell culture systems as well as in other circumstances
      where low activities or small samples must be assayed.

TI  - Low affinity binding of taurine to phospholiposomes and cardiac sarcolemma.
PG  - 559-66
AB  - A sarcolemma-enriched membrane fraction was prepared from the hearts of
      Sprague-Dawley rats and its ability to bind taurine (0.5-150 mM) was measured. In
      the absence of cations, the sarcolemma bound a maximum of 661 nmol taurine/mg
      protein, with a dissociation constant of 19.2 mM and a Hill coefficient of 1.9,
      indicating positive cooperativity. Scatchard analysis of taurine binding to
      sarcolemma gave a bell-shaped curve. Neither beta-alanine nor guanidinoethane
      sulfonate, inhibitors of taurine transport, affected the degree of taurine
      binding to sarcolemma. However, hypotaurine was an effective antagonist.
      Equimolar concentrations of Ca2+, Na+ or K+ also reduced taurine binding.
      Heterogeneous phospholipid vesicles of phosphatidylcholine,
      phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine
      (18:19:2:1) also bound taurine with positive cooperativity, yielding a
      bell-shaped Scatchard curve. The affinity of taurine for these mixed phospholipid
      vesicles was enhanced by the inclusion of cholesterol (50%). Taurine associated
      in a maximum ratio of 1:1 with homogeneous vesicles of phosphatidylcholine or
      phosphatidylserine. Vesicles of phosphatidylethanolamine bound taurine in a
      maximum ratio of 2:1, whereas those of phosphatidylinositol bound insignificant
      amounts of taurine. These studies demonstrate a low affinity binding to
      sarcolemma of taurine at concentrations normally present in rat heart. Similar
      levels of binding were observed in phospholipid vesicles, suggesting that the
      interaction of taurine with biological membranes involves phospholipids.

TI  - Retro-all-D and retro isomers of a formyl-methionyl peptide chemoattractant: an
      insight into the mode of binding at the receptor on rabbit neutrophils.
PG  - 545-9
AB  - The retro-all-D analog and retro isomer of the
      formyl-methionyl-carboxamide-tripeptide chemoattractant,
      CHO-L-Met-L-Leu-L-Phe-NH2, namely CHO-D-Phe-D-Leu-D-Met-NH2 and
      CHO-L-Phe-L-Leu-L-Met-NH2, respectively, have been synthesized in solution by
      classical methods and fully characterized. The tetrapeptide
      CHO-L-Phe-Gly-L-Leu-L-Met-NH2, representing the C-terminal portion of the
      tachykinin, Substance P, and resembling the sequence of the retro isomer, has
      also been synthesized and characterized. The three N alpha-formylated tripeptide 
      amides, prepared in order to obtain a deeper insight into the model of binding at
      the formyl peptide chemotactic receptor on rabbit neutrophils, have been tested
      for their ability to induce granule enzyme secretion from rabbit peritoneal
      neutrophils. The retro isomer, CHO-L-Phe-L-Leu-L-Met-NH2 is approximately
      100-fold less active, the retro-all-D analog, CHO-D-Phe-D-Leu-D-Met-NH2
      approximately 10,000-fold less active and the Substance P analog
      CHO-L-Phe-Gly-L-Leu-L-Met-NH2 1000-fold less active than the parent formyl
      peptide chemoattractant, CHO-L-Met-L-Leu-L-Phe-NH2. We interpret these results to
      indicate that a precise alignment of amino acid side chains as well as backbone
      amide bonds is an important factor involved in the receptor recognition of the
      formyl tripeptide chemoattractant.

TI  - Nitrogen-13 flux from L-[13N]glutamate in the isolated rabbit heart: effect of
      substrates and transaminase inhibition.
PG  - 531-44
AB  - Kinetic and biochemical parameters of nitrogen-13 flux from L-[13N]glutamate in
      myocardium were examined. Tissue radioactivity kinetics and chemical analyses
      were determined after bolus injection of L-[13N]glutamate into isolated
      arterially perfused interventricular septa under various metabolic states, which 
      included addition of lactate, pyruvate, aminooxyacetate (a transaminase
      inhibitor), or a combination of aminooxyacetate and pyruvate to the standard
      perfusate containing insulin and glucose. Chemical analysis of tissue and
      effluent at 6 min allowed determination of the composition of the slow third
      kinetic component of the time-activity curves. 13N-labeled aspartate, alanine and
      glutamate accounted for more than 80% of the tissue nitrogen-13 under the
      experimental conditions used. Specific activities for these amino acids were
      constant, but not identical to each other, from 6 through 15 min after
      administration of L-[13N]glutamate. Little labeled ammonia (1.9%) and glutamine
      (4.7%) were produced, indicating limited accessibility of exogenous glutamate to 
      catabolic mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, under
      control conditions. Lactate and pyruvate additions did not affect tissue amino
      acid specific activities. Aminooxyacetate suppressed formation of 13N-labeled
      alanine and aspartate and increased production of L-[13N]glutamine and
      [13N]ammonia. Formation of [13N]ammonia was, however, substantially decreased
      when aminooxyacetate was used in the presence of exogenous pyruvate. The data
      support a model for glutamate compartmentation in myocardium not affected by
      increasing the velocity of enzymatic reactions through increased substrate (i.e.,
      lactate or pyruvate) concentrations but which can be altered by competitive
      inhibition of transaminases (via aminooxyacetate) making exogenous glutamate more
      available to other compartments.

TI  - Is chemiluminescence an index of hepatic lipoperoxidation accompanying chloroform
      anesthesia?
PG  - 517-9
AB  - Hepatic lipoperoxidation by highly reactive metabolites produced during
      biodegradation of chloroform is believed to cause delayed hepatic necrosis.
      Chemiluminescence occurs during interaction of these metabolites with a lipid
      membrane. We have made continuous in vivo measurements of hepatic light output in
      the phenobarbital-induced rat breathing either air or chloroform vaporized in
      air. The data permitted direct estimation of the time course of
      chloroform-induced lipoperoxidation. These potentially toxic events began 15 min 
      after initiation of anesthesia and continued for the duration of the study.
      Chemiluminescence did not occur with inhalation of isoflurane, an anesthetic
      undergoing minimal biodegradation.

PG  - 474-81
AB  - Liposomes composed of either dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and oleic acid
      (pH-sensitive) or dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and oleic acid (pH-insensitive)
      were injected into C3H and Balb/c mice in order to determine the tissue
      distribution of both the lipid and the aqueous content. The lipid component was
      monitored by use of [3H]cholestanyl ether and the aqueous content was monitored
      by use of encapsulated 125I-tyraminyl-inulin. The pH-insensitive liposomes
      injected into both types of mice were rapidly cleared from the blood stream
      followed by accumulation primarily in the liver, followed by the spleen. The
      presence of a monoclonal antibody on the liposome surface caused a slight
      acceleration in liver accumulation, though generally gave the same profile as the
      antibody-free liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes were leaky upon exposure to the
      mouse plasma following injection. The lipid component, though, displayed a large 
      amount (e.g., 50-70% in C3H mice) of accumulation in the lung for up to 6 h,
      followed by a subsequent appearance in the liver and spleen. The presence of
      monoclonal antibody had no effect on the tissue distribution profile. These
      results indicate that the pH-sensitive liposomes, although ineffective as an
      aqueous drug delivery agent, may be effective as a means of delivering lipophilic
      drugs to the lung.

TI  - Inhibition of cell membrane lipid peroxidation by cadmium- and
      zinc-metallothioneins.
PG  - 448-61
AB  - The effects of all-zinc metallothionein (Zn-metallothionein) and predominantly
      cadmium metallothionein (Cd/Zn-metallothionein) on free radical lipid
      peroxidation have been investigated, using erythrocyte ghosts as the test system.
      When treated with xanthine and xanthine oxidase, Zn-metallothionein and
      Cd/Zn-metallothionein underwent thiolate group oxidation and metal ion release
      that was catalase-inhibitable, but superoxide dismutase-non-inhibitable. Similar 
      treatment in the presence of ghosts and added Fe(III) resulted in metallothionein
      oxidation that was significantly inhibited by superoxide dismutase. Ghosts
      incubated with xanthine/xanthine oxidase/Fe(III) underwent H2O2- and
      O2--dependent lipid peroxidation, as measured by thiobarbituric acid reactivity. 
      Neither type of metallothionein had any effect on xanthine oxidase activity, but 
      both strongly inhibited lipid peroxidation when added to the membranes
      concurrently with xanthine/xanthine oxidase/iron. This inhibition was far greater
      and more sustained than that caused by dithiothreitol at a concentration
      equivalent to that of metallothionein thiolate. Significant protection was also
      afforded when ghosts plus Cd/Zn-metallothionein or Zn-metallothionein were
      preincubated with H2O2 and Fe(III), and then subjected to vigorous peroxidation
      by the addition of xanthine and xanthine oxidase. These results could be mimicked
      by using Cd(II) or Zn(II) alone. Previous studies suggested that Zn(II) inhibits 
      xanthine/xanthine oxidase/iron-driven lipid peroxidation in ghosts by interfering
      with iron binding and redox cycling. Therefore, the primary determinant of
      metallothionein protection appears to be metal release and subsequent uptake by
      the membranes. These results have important implications concerning the
      antioxidant role of metallothionein, a protein known to be induced by various
      prooxidant conditions.

TI  - Effect of limited modification of amino groups on the reactivity of human factor 
      Xa.
PG  - 409-18
AB  - The basis of the specificity of human coagulation factor Xa has been probed with 
      a reagent that reacts with nucleophiles, N-succinimidylpropionate. At pH 8.0 and 
      0.25 mM N-succinimidylpropionate, 0.4 microM factor Xa lost approx. 90% of its
      activity toward prothrombin in 4 min. The decay was first-order, k = 0.64 min-1, 
      which increased to 0.98 min-1 in 1 mM Ca2+, and the dependence of k upon pH was
      consistent with primary amines being the target. The rate of modification was
      unaffected by the presence of a tetrapeptide substrate during modification;
      likewise, activity toward a tripeptide p-nitroanilide was unaltered during
      exposure of factor Xa to N-succinimidylpropionate with or without Ca2+. In
      addition, inhibition by antithrombin III was retained with a somewhat enhanced
      rate after modification; however, the acceleration of this by heparin was
      significantly less. Kinetic determination of the number of residues modified gave
      a reaction order of 2.0, while reaction with N-succinimidyl[3H]propionate yielded
      labeled factor Xa containing 1.0 mol N-succinimidylpropionate/mol factor Xa and
      50% normal clotting activity, or 2.0 mol N-succinimidylpropionate/mol and 1%
      activity, respectively. Thus, one nucleophilic group is required for the reaction
      of factor Xa with prothrombin but not for the hydrolysis of peptides or
      recognition of antithrombin III. The decay of clotting activity of the factor X
      zymogen in N-succinimidylpropionate was much slower though still Ca2+-dependent. 
      Conversely, the reaction of a related
      compound--N-succinimidyl(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate or Bolton-Hunter
      reagent--with factor Xa broadly resembled that of N-succinimidylpropionate but
      the decay curves indicated more complex kinetics. Therefore, the target groups
      vary in their accessibility to modification according to the structural
      characteristics of both the protein and the reagent.

TI  - Comparative kinetic analysis of the activation of human plasminogen by natural
      and recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator.
PG  - 402-8
AB  - Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) may be obtained from
      conditioned cell culture media (natural scu-PA) or by expression of the cDNA
      encoding human scu-PA in Escherichia coli (recombinant scu-PA). The activation of
      Glu-plasminogen by natural and recombinant scu-PA can be described by a sequence 
      of three reactions, each of which obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Initial
      activation of plasminogen to plasmin by scu-PA (reaction I) occurs with a high
      affinity (Km below 0.8 microM) for both scu-PAs, while the catalytic rate
      constant (k2) is 0.017 s-1 for recombinant scu-PA but only 0.0009 s-1 for natural
      scu-PA. Subsequent conversion of scu-PA to urokinase (two-chain urokinase-type
      plasminogen activator, tcu-PA) by generated plasmin (reaction II) occurs with a
      comparable affinity (Km about 5 microM) for natural and recombinant scu-PA and
      with a k2 of 0.23 s-1 for natural and 1.2 s-1 for recombinant scu-PA. Finally,
      activation of plasminogen by tcu-PA (reaction III) occurs with low affinity (Km
      30-50 microM) but with a high catalytic rate constant (k2 about 5 s-1) for both
      natural and recombinant tcu-PA. The differences in the kinetic parameters of the 
      activation of plasminogen by natural or recombinant scu-PA are thus mainly due to
      differences in turnover rate in the first reaction. Indeed, the catalytic rate
      constant of the first reaction is about 20-times higher for recombinant scu-PA
      than for natural scu-PA. Thus, surprisingly, the artificial, unglycosylated
      recombinant scu-PA molecule has a better catalytic efficiency than its natural
      glycosylated counterpart.

TI  - Laminar asymmetry in the distribution of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive
      neurons in the retina of the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri).
PG  - 332-8
AB  - Cholinergic neurons in the retina of the tree shrew were identified
      immunocytochemically using a monoclonal antibody directed against choline
      acetyltransferase (ChAT). The chief result is that roughly 4 times as many
      ChAT-immunoreactive neurons are found in the inner nuclear layer (INL) as in the 
      ganglion cell layer (GCL). In the INL, two classes of cholinergic neuron can be
      distinguished on the basis of soma size, one large and one small. The large
      neurons correspond closely in size and number to the displaced cholinergic
      neurons in the GCL, suggesting that these are the matching populations of
      cholinergic amacrine cells reported in other species. The small
      ChAT-immunoreactive neurons, on the other hand, which make up 60% of the total
      number of ChAT-positive neurons in the retina, appear to have no counterpart in
      the GCL. Whether these small neurons are a separate class of amacrine cell or
      some other cell type (e.g. bipolar, interplexiform, etc.) remains to be
      determined.

TI  - Lateral hypothalamic lesions in ground squirrels: rapid recovery and residual
      deficits.
PG  - 282-95
AB  - The effects of lateral hypothalamic (LH) lesions were studied in golden-mantled
      ground squirrels, Spermophilus lateralis, a species of mammalian hibernator that 
      displays endogenous circannual body weight cycles when kept in constant
      conditions. The lesions were made during the weight-gain phase. Evidence that the
      lesions were well placed included interruption of weight gain, transient aphagia,
      disrupted nest building, increased spillage of food crumbs and in some cases
      abnormal postures or movement. Despite these deficits most animals survived.
      Their body weights at the first postoperative peak of the cycle recovered either 
      to within the control range (Experiment 1) or close to preoperative peak levels
      (Experiment 2). There was no evidence that the lesions lowered set points. The
      rapid recovery of weight and eating by ground squirrels given only dry rodent
      chow, after large lesions (1.5-2.5 mA, DC anodal, 15-25 s), contrasts with what
      is seen in rats following LH lesions.

TI  - Anterior thalamic mediation of generalized pentylenetetrazol seizures.
PG  - 212-23
AB  - The effects of microinjection of various neuroactive compounds into the anterior 
      thalamic nucleus (AN) and other selected subcortical regions of guinea pig brain 
      on the expression of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced behavioral and electrical
      seizure activity were examined. Excitatory agents, kainic acid (KA), bicuculline 
      (BIC) or PTZ, injected into the AN or other thalamic nuclei, striatum, but not
      the mammillary bodies (MB), facilitated the EEG convulsant action of systemically
      administered PTZ. Injection of muscimol into the AN protected against the
      expression of PTZ-induced repetitive high-voltage EEG seizure discharges and
      inhibited the facilitatory effects of subcortically applied KA or BIC. Injection 
      of muscimol into the AN was also able to terminate established ongoing seizure
      discharges. Unilateral application of muscimol to the AN did not prevent the
      repetitive hypersynchronous EEG discharges following systemic PTZ but did result 
      in the delay in the onset of cortical hypersynchrony in the ipsilateral
      hemisphere. Muscimol injections into other thalamic nuclei, MB, cortex, striatum 
      or directly into the CSF space had no anticonvulsant effect, however.
      Microinjection of gamma-vinyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid, a selective GABA
      transaminase inhibitor, resulted in protection from the behavioral convulsant
      action and lethal effects of PTZ when administered into the thalamus, especially 
      the AN, but not when injected into the striatum or CSF. These data demonstrate
      that the AN is an important subcortical nucleus for the mediation of both
      cortical EEG synchrony and behavioral seizure expression induced by PTZ. In light
      of previous results establishing a role for the brainstem and diencephalon in PTZ
      seizure expression, the AN may serve, in part, as a gating mechanism for the
      propagation of paroxysmal activity between subcortical areas and the cerebral
      cortex.

AB  - Using highly purified T-kininogen and cathepsin E-like proteinase and 72 kDa
      proteinase in rat spleen, the release of T-kinin from T-kininogen was found to
      occur by consecutive cleavage by cathepsin E-like proteinase and 72 kDa
      proteinase. 72 kDa proteinase seems to be serine proteinase, because it was
      completely inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate but not by pepstatin,
      leupeptin and bestatin.

TI  - Tunicamycin and papulacandin B inhibit incorporation of specific mannoproteins
      into the wall of Candida albicans regenerating protoplasts.
PG  - 550-8
AB  - Regeneration of Candida albicans protoplasts began with the formation of a chitin
      network which was complemented after a lag of about 60 min by the deposition of
      beta-glucan. Proteins were incorporated early to the growing structure, beginning
      with the mannoproteins which are kept in place by non-covalent bonds.
      Incorporation of covalently linked mannoproteins took place only after deposition
      of glucan. The incorporation of these mannoproteins did not occur when
      protoplasts were incubated with papulacandin B which inhibited glucan formation, 
      or with tunicamycin which blocked N-glycosylation of mannoproteins. In the
      presence of papulacandin B, large amounts of native mannoproteins accumulated in 
      the medium. However, in the presence of tunicamycin, the large mannoprotein
      material found was of smaller apparent molecular weight, suggesting that it was
      deficient in glycosylation. Partially regenerated walls were able to incorporate 
      'in vitro' non-covalently bound mannoproteins, indicating that some components of
      very large cellular structures such as walls are capable of being articulated by 
      a self-assembly process.

TI  - Kinin-releasing enzyme from the venom of Bitis arietans (puff adder).
PG  - 502-9
AB  - A kinin-releasing enzyme was isolated from Bitis arietans (puff adder) venom by
      Sephadex G-100 and DEAE-cellulose column chromatographies. The kinin-releasing
      enzyme was shown to be homogeneous as demonstrated by a single band on acrylamide
      gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. Its molecular mass is approximately 45
      kDa with an isoelectric point of 6.5. Kinin-releasing enzyme possesses
      proteolytic activity which hydrolyzes the Leu6-Cys7, His10-Leu11 and Ala14-Leu15 
      bonds of the B chain of oxidized insulin and the A alpha and B beta chain of
      fibrinogen. Kinin-releasing and benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester hydrolytic
      activities of this enzyme were inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate,
      suggesting that the serine hydroxyl group is involved in enzymatic activities.

TI  - Stop ourselves smoking: a smoking cessation programme.
PG  - 954-6
AB  - The stop ourselves smoking (SOS) pilot programme, designed for those who want to 
      stop smoking, is based on a self-help approach. It was developed in Christchurch 
      to supplement existing smoking cessation programmes in the community. Of the 142 
      participants, 118 finished the course. Of these, 80 (68%) were not smoking at the
      end of the eighth week and 61 (52%) were still not smoking at the end of the
      15-month followup period. The success of this programme exceeds that of any
      reviewed in the literature. The format of the programme is readily adaptable to
      other lifestyle programmes.

TI  - Institutions versus community placements: the effects of different residential
      environments on the behaviour of intellectually handicapped adults.
PG  - 951-4
AB  - A major issue in the care of the intellectually handicapped is whether they
      should continue to be cared for in large institutions, or live in community
      homes. The community homes are presumed to provide more normal environments than 
      institutions, and to therefore encourage residents to behave more normally than
      they would in institutions. This study used a measure of normalisation to compare
      three hospital and four community residences for the intellectually handicapped. 
      It also measured changes in the behaviour of residents who moved from one
      environment to another. Results showed overlap in the level of normalisation of
      hospital and community units. Whether in the hospital or the community, the more 
      normal environments had residents with higher levels of adaptive behaviour and
      mental functioning. The everyday behaviour of residents who moved to more
      normalised units generally remained unchanged but some adaptive skills and
      interactive behaviours declined. The existence of continued training programmes
      appeared more critical than the normalisation of the home in developing and
      maintaining residents' behaviour.

TI  - The use of simulated patients in the assessment of actual clinical performance in
      general practice.
PG  - 948-51
AB  - This pilot study assessed a novel approach to the evaluation of clinical
      performance in the practice setting, using actors trained to simulate real
      patients. Thirteen general practitioner teachers, 10 family medicine training
      programme registrars, and 10 recent graduates of the FMTP were recruited. They
      agreed to be consulted by an unknown simulated patient. Two young patients with
      classical migraine were selected. Two young actors, a male and a female, were
      trained to simulate their symptomatology and history. A scoring system was
      devised to broadly assess a single general practice first consultation, and the
      simulators were trained to score. Eighty-five percent of respondents were willing
      to take part in a further study. Seventy-three percent had no suspicion at all
      that the patient was simulated. The average consultation time was 17 minutes
      (range 4-40). The average score was 67% (range 10-100%). The diagnosis was made
      in every case and a wide variety of treatments were prescribed. This appears to
      be a practical and acceptable method of assessing clinical performance.

PG  - 939-41
AB  - The pattern of postneonatal mortality over the past 16 years in Christchurch and 
      New Zealand is described. In Christchurch the postneonatal rate has risen from
      about four to eight per 1000 live births over this time, while for the rest of
      New Zealand the rate has been stable at about six. This rise has been due to an
      increasing number of cot deaths. The reason for this is unknown. Increased child 
      health surveillance may reduce these deaths.

      precipitation, gel filtration through Sephadex G-100, DEAE-Sephadex A-50
      chromatography and ion-exchange HPLC on DEAE-Polyol. The enzyme activity is
      stabilized (at temperatures from 0 degrees C to 40 degrees C) by 50 mM NH4+ or
      K+, while it is irreversibly lost in the absence of these or a few other
      monovalent cations. Glycerol (24% by volume) helps the cation in stabilizing the 
      enzyme activity above 40 degrees C, but also exerts per se a noticeable
      protecting effect at room temperature. B. cereus adenosine deaminase displays the
      following properties: Mr on Sephadex G-200, 68,000; Mr in SDS-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis, 53,700; optimal pH-stability (in the presence of 50 mM KCl) over
      the range 8-11 at 4 degrees C, and maximal catalytic activity at 30 degrees C
      between pH 7 and 10; Km for adenosine around 50 microM over the same pH range and
      Km for 2'-deoxyadenosine around 400 microM.

TI  - Non-competitive inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase by a phosphopeptide and
      phosphoamino acids.
PG  - 482-9
AB  - In Tetrahymena pyriformis the cytosolic ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine
      carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) activity is considerably inhibited by the presence of
      polyamines in the growth medium, while the nuclear ornithine decarboxylase is
      only slightly affected. Experimental evidence suggests that the presence of
      putrescine and/or spermidine elicits the appearance of non-competitive inhibitors
      of ornithine decarboxylase. One of the inhibitors has a molecular weight of
      25,000 and properties of antizyme. In addition, two other low molecular weight
      inhibitors are extracted, one which is a phosphoserine oligopeptide, and the
      other which is phosphotyrosine. All inhibit non-competitively the homologous and 
      heterologous (Escherichia coli and rat liver) ornithine decarboxylases.
      Similarly, non-competitive inhibition was obtained when the commercially
      available phosphoamino acids were tested against the already mentioned ornithine 
      decarboxylases.

      characterization of a human liver cytochrome P-450 isozyme catalyzing microsomal 
      mephenytoin hydroxylation.
PG  - 435-47
AB  - A genetic polymorphism causing deficient metabolism of the anticonvulsant drug
      mephenytoin occurs in 5% of the Caucasian and 23% of the Japanese population. By 
      monitoring the activities of the two major oxidative pathways of mephenytoin
      metabolism in the column eluates, we have purified from human livers a cytochrome
      P-450 isozyme, P-450 meph, which exclusively and stereoselectively catalyzes the 
      4-hydroxylation of (S)-mephenytoin, the major pathway affected by the
      polymorphism, whereas P-450 meph was virtually devoid of catalytic activity for
      N-demethylation of mephenytoin, the pathway remaining unaffected by the genetic
      deficiency. P-450 meph had an apparent Mr of 55 000 and a lambda max in the
      reduced CO-binding spectrum of 450 nm. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against
      purified human P-450 meph almost completely inhibited the 4-hydroxylation of
      mephenytoin but had little effect on N-demethylation in human liver microsomes.
      In microsomes of liver biopsies of two subjects characterized in vivo as 'poor
      metabolizers' of mephenytoin, immunocrossreactive and immunoinhibitable material 
      was observed with similar or identical properties to those of P-450 meph. There
      was no difference in the extent of the immunochemical reaction between microsomes
      of in vivo phenotyped poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of
      mephenytoin. These data suggest that P-450 meph is the target of the genetic
      deficiency and support the concept that a functionally altered variant form of
      P-450 meph causes this polymorphism.

TI  - Mucus glycoprotein secretion by duodenal mucosa in response to luminal
      arachidonic acid.
PG  - 419-28
AB  - The effect of luminal application of arachidonic acid on the alkaline secretion, 
      prostaglandin generation, and mucus glycoprotein output and composition was
      studied in proximal and distal duodenum of conscious dogs. Surgically prepared
      duodenal loops were instilled in vivo for up to 2 h with saline (control)
      followed by various concentrations (12.5-100 micrograms/ml) of arachidonic acid. 
      The experiments were conducted with and without intravenous pretreatment with
      indomethacin. The recovered instillates were assayed for the content of
      prostaglandin and HCO3-, and used for the isolation of mucus glycoprotein.
      Exposure of duodenal mucosa to arachidonic acid led to concentration-dependent
      increase in the output of HCO3- and prostaglandin generation. In both cases this 
      response was greater in the proximal duodenum. Pretreatment with indomethacin
      caused reduction in the basal HCO3- and prostaglandin output, and prevented the
      increments evoked by arachidonic acid. The proximal and distal duodenum displayed
      similar basal output and composition of mucus glycoprotein. Comparable increases 
      in these glycoproteins were also obtained with arachidonic acid, the effect of
      which was abolished by indomethacin. Compared to basal conditions, mucus
      glycoproteins elaborated in response to arachidonic acid exhibited higher
      contents of associated lipids and covalently bound fatty acids, and contained
      less protein. The associated lipids of mucus glycoproteins elaborated in the
      presence of arachidonic acid showed enrichment in phospholipids and decrease in
      neutral lipids. The carbohydrate components in these glycoproteins also exhibited
      higher proportions of sialic acid and sulfate. The changes brought about by
      arachidonic acid were prevented by indomethacin pretreatment, and in both cases
      the glycoprotein composition returned to that obtained under basal conditions.
      The enrichment of mucus glycoprotein in lipids, sialic acid and sulfate in
      response to endogenous prostaglandin may be of significance to the function of
      this glycoprotein in the hostile environment of the duodenum.

      on inhibition and facilitation in the dentate gyrus.
PG  - 404-8
AB  - The enkephalin analogue [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin, applied locally in vivo,
      enhanced the responsiveness of dentate granule cells of the hippocampus to
      perforant path stimulation. The facilitatory effect included a decrease in the
      inhibition and increase in the facilitation induced by sequential stimuli. The
      results indicate that opioids, acting at opioid receptors, can enhance
      responsiveness of the dentate gyrus to perforant path transmission, possibly via 
      a disinhibitory mechanism.

TI  - Protein glycosylation regulates the externalization of two distinct classes of
      glucocorticoid-induced glycoproteins in rat hepatoma cells.
PG  - 520-30
AB  - The relationship of protein glycosylation to the externalization of
      glucocorticoid inducible alpha1-acid glycoprotein and mouse mammary tumor virus
      glycoproteins was examined in M1.54, a clonal population of mouse mammary tumor
      virus-infected rat hepatoma cells. Multiple freeze-thaw of isolated microsomes
      revealed that while alpha 1-acid glycoprotein is carried through the cell as a
      soluble component of vesicles, extracellular viral glycoproteins are initially
      membrane-associated. At concentrations of tunicamycin that specifically inhibited
      N-linked protein glycosylation, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein fractionated between
      the cellular and extracellular compartments. Thus, approximately one half of the 
      newly synthesized, nonglycosylated (22,000 Mr) alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was
      rapidly secreted with kinetics similar to its glycosylated counterpart (release
      half-time of 60 min), while the remaining species first localized in an undefined
      intracellular compartment prior to its slow secretion (release half-time of 24
      h). The same distribution of nonglycosylated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was
      observed at various absolute levels of polypeptide, suggesting that this was not 
      due simply to the saturation of an efficient secretory pathway at high
      polypeptide levels. In contrast to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, no labeled viral
      antigens were released by tunicamycin-treated M1.54, while a nonglycosylated
      viral precursor glycopolyprotein was expressed intracellularly. Taken together,
      these results suggest that carbohydrate attachment strongly regulates the
      externalization of both alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and mouse mammary tumor virus
      species, which represent two distinct classes of extracellular glycoproteins.

TI  - Analysis of the ESR spectrum of synthetic dopa melanin.
PG  - 510-6
AB  - The 35 GHz ESR spectrum of frozen aqueous suspensions of synthetic melanin from
      autoxidation of dopa is asymmetric in the pH range 3-12. This asymmetry increases
      with increasing pH. A detailed computer analysis of second-derivative spectra
      suggests that the asymmetry is a result of two factors: approximately axial
      anisotropy of the g-tensor of the radical species; superposition of ESR spectra
      arising from a total of four radical species. The relative amounts of these
      individual spectra vary in a pH-dependent manner. Anisotropy of spectra varies
      with pH, probably due to pH-induced changes in the delocalization of the unpaired
      electrons. Thus the species present at high pH are suggested to be relatively
      localized radical anions, while the species detected at low pH are suggested to
      be protonated forms of the high pH species in which the unpaired electron is more
      extensively delocalized.

TI  - Effect of doxazosin on blood pressure and renal haemodynamics of hypertensive
      patients with renal failure.
PG  - 942-5
AB  - Doxazosin, a quinazoline derivative, has alpha 1- adrenoreceptor antagonist
      properties similar to those of prazosin. This antihypertensive agent has a longer
      elimination half-life than prazosin. The pharmacokinetic properties of doxazosin 
      are not significantly different in patients with renal insufficiency compared
      with healthy controls. In this study eight hypertensive patients with renal
      insufficiency were studied during a two week washout period, followed by a two
      week single blind placebo phase and an eight week open doxazosin treatment
      period. Doxazosin was commenced in a dose of 1 mg daily and titrated if
      necessary, with the dose being doubled every two weeks. In all but one patient
      doxazosin was successful in controlling the blood pressure. Treatment with
      doxazosin for eight weeks had no adverse effects on the effective renal plasma
      flow or glomerular filtration rate of these patients. Six of the eight patients
      suffered side effects attributable to doxazosin.

TI  - Demonstration of a heterogeneous distribution of glycolytic enzymes and of
      pyruvate kinase isoenzymes types M1 and M2 in unfertilized hen eggs.
PG  - 395-401
AB  - The intracellular distribution of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase,
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and the pyruvate 
      kinase isoenzymes type M1 and type M2 within unfertilized hen eggs was studied.
      Most of glycolytic enzyme activities were found in the yolk fraction; 8-24% of
      total glycolytic enzyme activities were found in the vitelline membrane fraction.
      However, the specific activities of these enzymes in the vitelline membrane
      fraction are 19-72-fold higher (U/mg protein) and 45-178-fold more concentrated
      (U/g wet weight) than in the yolk fraction. The study of intracellular
      localization of pyruvate kinase isoenzymes shows that the blastodisc, latebra and
      vitelline membrane contain only pyruvate kinase type M2, whereas pyruvate kinase 
      types M1 and M2 are found in the egg yolk. The exclusive occurrence of pyruvate
      kinase type M2 in the blastodisc is consistent with the concept that this
      isoenzyme is involved in the cell proliferation. The heterogeneous distribution
      of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
      and lactate dehydrogenase, and the heterogeneous localization of the pyruvate
      kinase isoenzymes types M1 and M2 indicate that glycolysis is distributed
      heterogeneously within the unfertilized hen egg cell.

PG  - 395-8
AB  - A novel amino acid, acromelic acid, which is one of kainoids isolated from a
      poisonous mushroom, markedly depolarizes the crayfish opener muscle fiber in a
      dose-dependent manner, its potency being much greater than that of kainoids such 
      as kainic or domoic acid. Moreover, acrolemic acid markedly potentiates the
      glutamate response, in spite of the fact that it reduces the quisqualate response
      in a dose-dependent manner. The amplitude of excitatory junctional potentials was
      slightly reduced by acromelic acid.

TI  - GABA-gated chloride ion influx and receptor binding studies in C57BL6J and DBA2J 
      mice.
PG  - 374-8
AB  - GABA-gated chloride ion influx was measured in brain 'microsac' preparations of
      young (20-22-day-old) and older (40-42-day-old) C57BL6J and DBA2J mice. The young
      DBA2J mice are susceptible to audiogenic seizures. GABA sensitivity was reduced
      in young DBA2J mice as compared to age-matched C57BL6J mice or older mice of
      either strain. Age and strain differences in ligand binding to
      GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex and glutamate receptor could not account for
      this finding. These results provide evidence for a defect in GABA-gated chloride 
      ion influx in audiogenic seizure-susceptible DBA2J mice.

AB  - Catecholamine innervation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) cell
      subtypes in rats was investigated over development using double label, light
      microscopic immunocytochemistry. Similar results were observed in both sexes. The
      number of catecholamine-apposed sLH-RH cells remained constant, while the number 
      of catecholamine-apposed iLH-RH cells increased as a function of age. These
      results suggest that LH-RH cell subtypes are differentially innervated and
      support the hypothesis that the development of iLH-RH cells represent newly
      innervated surfaces which are related to changes in the processing of incoming
      information relevant to reproductive maturation.

TI  - GRF neurons in the rat hypothalamus.
PG  - 250-61
AB  - The growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF)-containing neuronal system was
      immunohistochemically studied in the rat hypothalamus. The immunolabeled cell
      bodies were determined by intraventricular administration of colchicine 24 h
      before killing. In intact animals, the neurons appeared in the ventral portion of
      the arcuate nucleus (group 1) and in the area surrounding the ventromedial
      nucleus (group 2). Most of the cell bodies also indicated immunoreactivity for
      tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The immunoreactive fibers accumulated showing a
      palisade arrangement in the external layer of the median eminence. The rats
      treated neonatally with monosodium glutamate revealed group 2 neurons and a few
      immunoreactive fibers in the median eminence. Half-anterolateral deafferentation 
      of the medial basal hypothalamus, which was performed to isolate group 1 neurons 
      or both group 1 and 2 neurons from the other brain parts, did not remarkably
      affect the appearance of the fibers in the median eminence. However, the
      perikarya were hypertrophic and strongly immunolabeled for GRF and TH. It is
      concluded that the fibers containing GRF in the median eminence derive mostly
      from group 1 neurons, and that the neurons may be regulated by an inhibitory
      mechanism by other neurons on the outside of the deafferented hypothalamic
      islands. GRF synthesized in group 2 neurons may act on other neurons as a
      neurotransmitter-like substance.

TI  - Neurochemical changes in the substantiae nigrae and caudate nuclei following
      acute unilateral intranigral infusions of
      N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).
PG  - 339-45
AB  - Acute unilateral intranigral infusions of MPTP at doses (200 micrograms) which
      produce robust contralateral rotation in the rat induced significant
      neurochemical changes in the ipsilateral as well as contralateral nigrostriatal
      systems. There were pronounced increases in the levels of dopamine (DA),
      dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the ipsilateral
      substantia nigra and a significant decrease in the levels of DA in the
      ipsilateral caudate nucleus while opposite changes occurred in the contralateral 
      substantia nigra and caudate nucleus. The DOPAC:DA and HVA:DA ratios were
      significantly higher in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus indicating increased
      activity of the ipsilateral nigrostriatal DA neurones. The levels of
      noradrenaline and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethyline glycol (MHPG) increased and
      decreased significantly in the ipsilateral and contralateral substantia nigra,
      respectively, but there were no significant changes in the caudate nuclei. The
      levels of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) increased
      significantly in the ipsilateral substantia nigra and caudate nucleus as well as 
      in the contralateral caudate nucleus but did not increase significantly in the
      contralateral substantia nigra. The 5-HIAA:5-HT ratio was significantly decreased
      in the contralateral caudate nucleus indicating a reduced activity of the
      contralateral nigrostriatal 5-HT neurones. The data thus indicate that MPTP
      applied to one substantia nigra is capable of producing profound neurochemical
      changes not only locally but also in the ipsilateral striatum as well as in the
      contralateral nigrostriatal system. Previous neuropharmacological studies have
      suggested that the rotation induced by intranigral MPTP may be mediated via
      dopamine released from dendrites in the pars reticulata in response to
      MPTP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Regional distribution of neuropeptide K and other tachykinins (neurokinin A,
      neurokinin B and substance P) in rat central nervous system.
PG  - 240-9
AB  - Neurokinin A and B (NKA and NKB) and neuropeptide K (NPK) were recently isolated 
      from porcine spinal cord and brain, and together with substance P (SP)
      considerably extend the list of tachykinin-like peptides present in the mammalian
      nervous system. In order to investigate the distribution of tachykinins in the
      central nervous system (CNS) we have recently developed sensitive
      radioimmunoassays (RIA) for both SP and NKA. As NKB and NPK cross-react in the
      RIA for NKA we were able to determine the content of NKA, NKB and NPK after
      separation of rat CNS extracts by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC). Comparison of different extraction methods suggested that 
      0.1 M hydrochloric acid gave the best extraction and recovery of NKA-like
      immunoreactivity from rat brain. Characterization of these tachykinins using HPLC
      and gel-filtration columns revealed that C18 columns did not adequately separate 
      NPK from NKB under the conditions used by previous authors. Thus 'NKB' content
      reported previously on the basis of HPLC separation would correspond to the sum
      of both NPK and NKB content. In the present study, therefore, we introduced
      modified elution conditions to resolve NPK from NKB and determined the regional
      distributions of these tachykinins in the rat CNS. SP was the most abundant
      tachykinin in every region studied. After SP, the NKA concentration was highest
      and NKB concentration was lowest in all regions except for the cortex and
      hippocampus where the NPK concentration was highest. The molar ratio of these
      peptides seemed to be relatively constant in the 3 regional groups
      (striatum-substantia nigra, cerebral cortex-hippocampus, dorsal root
      ganglia-dorsal and ventral horns of spinal cord) and suggests that regional
      specific translation or processing may exist.

TI  - Cytokeratins of the bovine hoof: classification and studies on expression.
PG  - 462-73
AB  - The bovine hoof has been examined as a model for the study of keratinized skin
      appendages. We characterized the keratin polypeptides of hoof bed and matrix and 
      compared them to epidermis using two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot
      techniques. Both hoof tissues express keratins 6 and 16 (as described by Franke
      et al. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 153, 933-959) and b2 and a1-4 which are previously
      undescribed proteins unique to the bovine hoof. Keratins of hoof matrix and bed
      share one or more common antigenic components as defined by immunoblot analysis. 
      Hoof matrix expresses keratins 7 and 14, which are absent in hoof bed, and also
      expresses a greater number of isoelectric variants of keratin 6. Biopsies of hoof
      bed and matrix transplanted onto athymic mice both made hard hoof and underwent
      active keratin synthesis as evidenced by incorporation of [3H]leucine. Indirect
      immunofluorescence studies of the grafts showed that they had the histology and
      immunoreactivity previously noted for hoof bed and matrix. The two-dimensional
      gel electrophoretic patterns of both grafts were similar and expressed keratins
      b2 and a1-4. We conclude that a unique group of keratins exists in hoof.
      Furthermore, while hoof matrix is the major contributor to hard hoof, hoof bed
      epidermis maintains the capacity to make hard hoof and may contribute to the
      synthesis of the hoof plate in vivo. The ability to graft hoofs onto athymic mice
      provides an opportunity for the study of a number of aspects of hoof formation.

TI  - Three small RNAs within the 10 kb trypanosome rRNA transcription unit are
      analogous to domain VII of other eukaryotic 28S rRNAs.
PG  - 9471-89
AB  - We have localized the six ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) which encode the 28S rRNA region
      of Trypanosoma brucei. These six rRNAs include two large rRNAs, 28S alpha
      (approx. 1840 nt) and 28S beta (approx. 1570 nt), and four small rRNAs of
      approximate sizes 220, 180, 140 and 70 nt. Three of these four small rRNAs (180, 
      70 and 140) are found at the 3' end of the 28S rRNAs region. Sequence analysis of
      this area shows that these three small rRNAs encode Domain VII, the last domain
      of secondary structure in the 28S rRNAs of eukaryotes. Hybridization of labeled
      nascent RNA to the cloned repeat unit and S1 nuclease protection analysis of
      putative precursors show that transcription initiates approximately 1.2 kb
      upstream of the 18S rRNA and terminates after the last small rRNA (140) at the 3'
      end of the 28S rRNA region. Analysis of three putative rRNA precursors suggests
      that the small rRNAs are not processed from the primary transcript until after
      the usual processing of the 5.8S rRNA region.

TI  - Human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase gene: complete gene sequence and sites
      of expression.
PG  - 9397-406
AB  - The human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene has been sequenced to 
      completion. The gene is divided into six exons spanning approximately 4,200 bp.
      Exon five codes for amino acids homologous to the interfacial active site of
      several lipases, and also codes for an amphipathic alpha-helix resembling the
      carboxy terminus of apolipoprotein E. Blot hybridization data suggest that there 
      is only one LCAT gene in humans. The 1550 base LCAT mRNA can be detected in liver
      and HepG2 (hepatocyte) cells, but not in small intestine, spleen, pancreas,
      placenta or adrenal tissue.

TI  - The nucleotide sequence and transcription of minicircular mitochondrial DNA's
      associated with male-fertile and cytoplasmic male-sterile lines of sugarbeet.
PG  - 9353-70
AB  - Male-fertile (MF) and cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) lines of sugarbeet possess
      characteristic low molecular weight minicircular mitochondrial DNA's, and
      Southern hybridizations revealed sequence homologies between them. The complete
      nucleotide sequences of minicircle a present in MF and CMS lines, and minicircle 
      d present in some MF lines have been determined and compared to minicircle c
      present in all MF lines. Computer analysis revealed sequences common to all three
      DNA's: these may be essential to their maintenance in sugarbeet mitochondria.
      Analysis of the extent and arrangement of homologous sequences in minicircle a
      and minicircle d suggests the latter may have arisen from an intramolecular
      recombination event in minicircle a. The G+C contents of the minicircles differ
      and their possible origins are discussed. All three DNA's are transcribed.
      Minicircle c and minicircle d transcripts are exclusive to MF mitochondria, but
      are unlikely to encode protein products. Two transcripts of sufficient size and
      the predicted polarity to encompass a short open reading frame on minicircle a
      are common to both MF and CMS mitochondria.

TI  - The region of phage T4 genes 34, 33 and 59: primary structures and organization
      on the genome.
PG  - 9311-27
AB  - The product of gene 33 is essential for the regulation of late transcription and 
      gene product 59 is required in recombination, DNA repair and replication. The
      exact functions of both proteins are not known. Restriction fragments spanning
      the genomic area of genes 33 and 59 have been cloned into phage M13 and a 4.9 kb 
      nucleotide sequence has been determined. Translation of the DNA sequence
      predicted that gp33 contains 112 amino acids with a mol.wt. of 12.816 kd while
      gp59 is composed of 217 amino acids adding up to a mol.wt. of 25.967 kd. The
      genomic area studied here also contains 3 open reading frames of genes not
      identified to date and it is thought to include the NH2-terminal part of g34. One
      of the open reading frames seems to code for the 10 kd protein, probably involved
      in the regulation of transcription of bacteriophage T4. This protein is predicted
      to consist of 89 amino acid residues with a mol.wt. of 10.376 kd. Gene 33 and the
      gene for the 10 kd protein were cloned separately on high expression vectors
      resulting in over-production of the two proteins.

TI  - (A-T)n tracts embedded in random sequence DNA--formation of a structure which is 
      chemically reactive and torsionally deformable.
PG  - 9291-309
AB  - Alternating d(A-T)n sequences which are contiguous with DNA of effectively random
      sequence have an abnormal conformation in linear DNA molecules. These regions are
      strongly reactive towards chemical modification by osmium tetroxide, and are
      preferentially cleaved by micrococcal nuclease. Both the chemical modification
      and the enzymic cutting occur uniformly through the alternating tract, and there 
      is no evidence for enzyme or chemical sensitivity in the interfaces between the
      tract and DNA of normal conformation. These reactivities have a requirement for
      an alternating sequence. In addition to chemical reactivity, alternating (A-T)n
      sequences exhibit anomalously small twist changes on cruciform formation,
      suggesting that the pre-extruded DNA is underwound. We propose that the
      alternating sequences adopt an altered conformation which is subject to easy
      torsional deformation.

TI  - Cellular gene induction during herpes simplex virus infection can occur without
      viral protein synthesis.
PG  - 9261-70
AB  - Infection of cultured cells with herpes simplex virus (HSV) results in the
      transcriptional induction of a small number of cellular genes. Although the
      majority of such genes are dependent upon viral protein synthesis for their
      induction, a small minority are not. These genes are induced by events occurring 
      prior to the onset of viral protein synthesis, in particular by binding of the
      virus to the cell surface and cellular entry of the virion. The significance of
      such cellular gene induction early in viral infection is discussed in terms of
      virus-cell interaction in general and the mechanism of transformation by HSV in
      particular.

TI  - Essential features of the assembly origin of tobacco mosaic virus RNA as studied 
      by directed mutagenesis.
PG  - 9229-42
AB  - The assembly origin of tobacco mosaic virus RNA contains three stable hairpin
      loops. Coat protein disks bind first to loop 1 (the 3' most) during virus
      assembly, but the whole region is coated in a concerted fashion even in
      conditions of limiting protein. It is shown by in vitro packaging assays using
      mutant assembly origin transcripts that rapid and specific assembly initiation
      occurs in the absence of loops 2 and 3, but is abolished on removal of loop 1.
      Deletion or alteration of the unpaired AAGAAGUCG sequence at the apex of loop 1
      also abolishes rapid packaging; this sequence is therefore instrumental in disk
      binding. Alteration of this sequence to (A)9 leads to packaging at a very low
      rate (half time 12 hours) which is apparently non-sequence specific. Substitution
      of (CCG)3 evokes packaging with a half time of 3 hours, as compared to 15 seconds
      for the wild type assembly origin. These results suggest that the three-base G
      periodicity within this sequence element is an important feature in assembly
      nucleation.

TI  - Cloning, expression and sequencing the molybdenum-pterin binding protein (mop)
      gene of Clostridium pasteurianum in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 9371-80
AB  - mop is the structural gene for the molybdenum-pterin binding protein, which is
      the major molybdenum binding protein in Clostridium pastuerianum. The mop gene
      was detected by immunoscreening genomic libraries of C. pastuerianum and
      identified by determining the nucleotide sequence of the cloned insert of
      clostridial DNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of an open reading frame proved 
      to be identical to the first twelve residues of purified Mop. The DNA sequence
      flanking the mop gene contains promoter-like consensus sequences which are
      probably responsible for the expression of Mop in Escherichia coli. The deduced
      amino acid composition shows that the protein is hydrophobic, lacks aromatic and 
      cysteine residues and has a calculated molecular weight of 7,038. The N-terminal 
      amino acid sequence of Mop has sequence homology with DNA binding proteins. The
      pattern and type of residues in the N-terminal region suggest it forms the
      helix-turn-helix structure observed in DNA binding proteins. We propose that Mop 
      may be a regulatory protein binding the anabolic source of molybdenum.

TI  - Introduction of estrogen-responsiveness into mammalian cell lines.
PG  - 9329-37
AB  - We introduced estrogen responsiveness as a new characteristic into rat hepatoma, 
      mouse Ltk- and human HeLatk-cells by transfecting the human estrogen receptor
      (ER) cDNA. To measure the estrogen response we used Xenopus vitellogenin gene A2 
      constructs linked to the bacterial CAT gene. Transient cotransfections of the ER 
      cDNA and the vitellogenin gene-CAT constructs containing the estrogen responsive 
      element (ERE) lead to a hormone dependent induction of CAT activity whereas
      cotransfected vitellogenin gene constructs lacking the ERE are not inducible.
      Stable transfections of ER cDNA into Ltk- cells give rise to cell clones that are
      estrogen responsive as shown by transfection of various vitellogenin gene-CAT
      constructs. These results prove that the transfected ER is biologically active
      and is sufficient to make a cell estrogen responsive.

      DNA.
PG  - 9491-508
AB  - Proton-NMR has been used to determine the activation energies and pre-exponential
      factors for the deuterium exchange of AH8 in poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT), and for GH8
      in poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC). No simple relationship between the kinetic parameters
      and molecular conformation was found. By addition of 4.5 M NaCl a transition from
      the B to the Z conformation was induced for poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), and an
      increased exchange rate was observed. The exchange rate for
      poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) also increased below 64 degrees C, and a significant
      decrease in activation energy on addition of 4.5 M NaCl was observed. The
      exchange rates at T = 55.8 degrees C were also measured for the AH8 and GH8 in
      random sequence calf thymus DNA. From the difference in exchange rates, a method 
      of preferential labeling of either the AH8 or the GH8 in high molecular weight
      DNA is evaluated.

TI  - Simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro: purification and characterization of
      replication factors from mouse cells.
PG  - 9457-70
AB  - We have previously developed simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication system in
      vitro (Ariga and Sugano, J. Virol. 48, 481, 1983). This system is composed of
      human HeLa or mouse FM3A nuclear extract and cytoplasmic extract of SV40 infected
      CosI cells. Here FM3A nuclear extract was fractionated by DEAE Sephacel and
      single-stranded DNA cellulose chromatography into three components required for
      accurate in vitro SV40 DNA replication. One fraction (A fraction) contained DNA
      polymerase-primase, and the second component (B fraction) contained DNA
      topoisomerase. Third component was further purified to near homogenuity using
      DEAE-Sephacel, single-stranded DNA cellulose, and glycerol gradient
      centrifugation. The purified protein (named factor I) bound to the origin
      containing fragment of SV40 DNA. The factor I enhanced the initiation of SV40 DNA
      replication catalyzed by SV40 infected CosI cytoplasm alone. When all four
      fractions consisting of A, B fractions, factor I, and SV40 infected CosI
      cytoplasm were mixed together, the system was reconstituted, meaning that
      initiation and subsequent elongation were completed to generate the full sized
      daughter molecules.

PG  - 9425-44
AB  - We have analyzed the prominent supercoil-dependent S1 nuclease cleavage site 5'
      to hsp 26 in the plasmid 88B13, which contains 11.7 kilobases from the Drosophila
      locus 67B1. The double stranded cleavage product is generated by initial nicking 
      on the purine strand, six preferred sites occurring between positions -96 and -90
      (relative to the start of transcription) with weaker ones extending to position
      -84, followed by cleavage on the pyrimidine strand at positions -86 and -84. A
      derivative of 88B13, 88B13-X, was generated by insertion of an Xho I linker at
      position -84; this does not affect the positions or strand specificity of the S1 
      cleavage in that region. A small deletion, delta 41.1, removes the
      homopurine/homopyrimidine stretch from positions -86 to -132 and is no longer
      sensitive to cleavage by S1 nuclease 5' to hsp 26. Mung bean and P1 nucleases
      recognize the same site 5' to hsp 26 and give the same general pattern of
      cleavage. All three nucleases show an initial cleavage of 88B13 DNA at this site 
      at pH 5.5 but not at pH 6.5, indicating that the DNA structure there may be pH
      dependent in vitro.

TI  - Xrep, a plasmid-stimulating X chromosomal sequence bearing similarities to the BK
      virus replication origin and viral enhancers.
PG  - 9407-23
AB  - The human X chromosome-linked fragment, "Xrep," was sequenced because it exerts a
      positive effect on plasmid growth in both E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
      The sequence revealed three features similar to the human BK virus replication
      origin: Xrep has a true palindrome, CCTCC(T)3CCTCC, which is similar to "true"
      palindrome-like sequences found at the replication origins of polyoma
      [CCTC(T/C)10CTCC], BK [CCTC(A/G)8CCTCC] and SV40 [CCTCC(A)6GCCTCC] viruses.
      Twenty nucleotides away from the true palindrome, Xrep has the sequence
      GAATCCTATTCACTTTT while BK virus, the human analogue of SV40, has
      GAAATCCCTATTCTTTT in exactly the same position relative to the true palindrome.
      These two 17-mers differ only in the positions of two nucleotides comparing Xrep 
      and BK virus. Also similar to the replication origins of DNA viruses, Xrep
      appears to have a cluster of enhancers adjacent to the origin-like sequences.
      Potent enhancer-like activity was detected in pSV1 X CAT/Xrep constructs. Xrep
      may originate from an endogenous virus, or from an X chromosomal replication
      origin.

TI  - Comparison of promoter suppression in avian and murine retrovirus vectors.
PG  - 9381-96
AB  - Previously, we described "promoter suppression" in infectious retrovirus vectors 
      with two genes and an internal promoter. Here, we examined several parameters of 
      promoter suppression and found that the amount of suppression in an integrated
      retrovirus vector was dependent both on whether the vector was derived from
      spleen necrosis virus or murine leukemia virus and on which internal promoter was
      present in the vector. Murine leukemia virus vectors showed less suppression than
      analogous spleen necrosis virus vectors. Furthermore, the amount of suppression
      was not dependent on either the relative strengths of the promoters nor the
      distance between the promoters. Moreover, we found that in vectors in which one
      promoter was suppressed, there was an inverse correlation between the DNaseI
      sensitivity of the chromatin surrounding a promoter and the suppression of its
      expression.

TI  - Adenovirus-2 E1a and E1b gene products regulate enhancer mediated transcription.
PG  - 9445-56
AB  - We have shown that adenovirus-2 early region 1 gene products in trans and the
      SV40 enhancer in cis have an additive effect in stimulating transcription from
      adenovirus IVa2 and major late promoters (Natarajan, V. and Salzman, N. P.,
      Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4067, 1985). In the present study, we show that both
      the E1a and E1b gene products are necessary for this stimulatory effect on
      enhancer mediated transcription. In the absence of E1b region, the transcription 
      is strongly suppressed by E1a. Transcription from E1a promoter is also stimulated
      4-5 fold in the presence of E1b region. The data suggest that 21K protein coded
      by the E1b region modulates transcription from the E1a promoter and the action of
      E1a gene products on transcription from other promoters.

TI  - A sequence upstream from the coding region is required for the transcription of
      the 7SK RNA genes.
PG  - 9243-60
AB  - We have isolated and characterized two recombinant lambda phages containing
      sequences homologous to 7SK RNA which code for a RNA 330 nucleotides long in an
      "in vitro" transcription system. S1 mapping of the transcript shows that this RNA
      corresponds to the 7SK RNA obtained from human cells, indicating that the two
      recombinant phages contain genes coding for 7SK RNA. The transcription of these
      genes is polymerase III dependent. Sequences upstream from the start of
      transcription are essential for "in vitro" synthesis of 7SK RNA, suggesting that 
      internal promoter elements, if present, are not sufficient to support the
      synthesis of 7SK RNA. A region of homology with the upstream sequences of the
      genes for U6 RNA, 7SL RNA and Bombyx mori alanine tRNA is found within 50 bp from
      the transcription start point. Within the homologous region a motif common to the
      four genes is a "TATA"-like box, placed at position -30 to -25 of the 7SK RNA
      gene, which is typical of the polymerase II promoter region.

TI  - On the functional roles of simian virus 40 large and small T-antigen in the
      induction of a mitotic host response.
PG  - 9339-51
AB  - The early gene of wild-type (wt) SV40 specifies two related proteins, referred to
      as large (Mr 88,000) and small (Mr 19,000) T-antigen. Infection with wt SV40 of
      Go/G1-arrested monkey kidney and CV-1 cell cultures induced in virtually 100% of 
      the cells T-antigen synthesis, followed by a mitotic reaction and the production 
      of SV40 DNA. Parallel cultures were infected with SV40 deletion mutants that
      produce either no small T-antigen (d1883) or only trace amounts of a truncated
      form (d1891). Kinetics of synthesis and accumulation of large T-antigen was
      closely similar to that observed with wtSV40 whereas apparently only 50-60% of
      the cells participated in the mitotic reaction and the production of viral DNA.
      These results and those obtained from a comparative study on the abortive
      (transforming) infection in Go-arrested mouse tissue culture cells indicate that 
      synthesis of large T-antigen alone is sufficient to trigger in 50-60% of the
      infected cells a mitotic reaction.

TI  - A new family of LTR-like sequences abundantly expressed in rat tumors.
PG  - 9271-89
AB  - We report the identification of two genome DNA fragments containing middle
      repetitive sequences abundantly expressed in various rat tumors but rarely in
      normal tissues. These fragments included homologous regions which belonged to a
      new family of long terminal repeat (LTR) like sequences, designated RAL elements;
      one displayed the solitary type and the other a provirus structure. The element
      was transcribed in a strand specific fashion and started from the presumptive cap
      site within the RAL element. The presumptive polyA addition site within the
      element was also utilized as evidence of the analysis of a cDNA clone containing 
      the RAL element. This evidence suggested that transcriptional control signals
      within the element were functioning. Run on assay revealed that expression of the
      element was regulated at the transcriptional level.

TI  - Distribution and ultrastructure of synapses on a premotor local nonspiking
      interneuron of the crayfish.
PG  - 259-70
AB  - Many premotor local nonspiking interneurons are involved in the control of the
      uropod movements of a crayfish. One of these interneurons was impaled
      intracellularly, characterized physiologically, and then labeled by intracellular
      horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injection to examine the distribution and
      ultrastructure of synapses. Depolarization of this interneuron by a current
      injection excited the closer motoneurons of the uropod and inhibited its opener
      motoneurons, but hyperpolarization had no effect. Input and output synapses are
      distributed all over the major branches and the finer neurites except for the
      main neurite (7-10 micron in diameter), which runs near the dorsal surface of the
      neuropil. Both types of synapse are located on the same neurite and are often
      intermingled in close proximity, often less than 1 micron apart. Presynaptic
      terminals of the interneuron contain round, clear vesicles that are densely
      packed in fine branches and spines. The number of synaptic vesicles associated
      with a particular output synapse was estimated to be about 2,000. No dense-cored 
      granules are observed in the labeled neurites. Our results support the proposal
      that synaptic transmission in this class of interneurons of the crayfish can
      sometimes be restricted to a very small region of the branches and that,
      therefore, different regions of the interneuron can function independently.

TI  - Morphological alterations in subcortical vibrissal relays following vibrissal
      follicle destruction at birth in the mouse.
PG  - 166-83
AB  - Morphological modifications of two subcortical vibrissal relays were analyzed,
      following destruction of vibrissal follicles in newborn mice. The volume of the
      nucleus interpolaris (NI) of the trigeminal nuclear complex in the brainstem
      decreased by 33%, while the number of its neuronal perikarya decreased only
      moderately. Vibrissal deafferentation caused no shrinkage of the ventrobasal
      complex (VB). In the damaged medial vibrissal part of VB (VBm), however, neuronal
      density was higher than normal, indicating the prevention or retardation of
      physiologically programmed cell death in the afferentation deprived thalamic
      somatosensory relay station. It is suggested that the difference in neuron
      density produced by deafferentation is related to the states of maturation at
      birth of the two subcortical vibrissal relays. Following vibrissal
      deafferentation the basic organization of the synaptic neuropil appeared to be
      similar to the control. Quantitative electron microscopic (EM) analysis revealed,
      however, an increased number of axon terminals with ovoid synaptic vesicles in
      both deafferented relay stations. The increased density of gamma-aminobutyric
      acid (GABA)-immunostained boutons observed in the VBm following vibrissal
      deprivation suggested a compensatory increase most probably of the inhibitory
      axon endings. Quantitative EM analysis also provided evidence that many or most
      of the specific afferent terminals in the damaged VBm were not identical with but
      were substitutes for the original "vibrissal" specific afferents. Forty percent
      of all "specific" afferents were shown to be modified corticothalamic terminals. 
      The modification and the resemblence of some cortical endings to specific
      afferents demonstrated the morphogenetic plasticity of synaptogenesis in these
      terminals during development as well as the importance and inductive potential of
      the postsynaptic target in the differentiation of presynaptic axon terminals.

PG  - 143-65
AB  - The topographic relationships between anterior thalamic neurons and their
      terminal projection fields in the retrosplenial cortex of the rat were
      characterized by experiments with the fluorescent dye retrograde labeling
      technique. The results demonstrate that the anterodorsal (DAD) and anteroventral 
      (AV) nuclei project heavily to retrosplenial granular cortex (Rg) and to a lesser
      extent to retrosplenial agranular cortex (Rag). In contrast, the anteromedial
      (AM) and lateral dorsal (LD) nuclei project heavily to Rag and more lightly to
      Rg. Irrespective of terminal field in Rg or Rag, the neuronal cell bodies in AD
      and AV are organized topographically so that the neurons in the caudal part of
      each nucleus project to rostral retrosplenial cortex and the neurons in the
      rostral portion of each nucleus project to the caudal retrosplenial cortex.
      Further, the ventromedial AD and AV neurons project to rostral retrosplenial
      cortex, whereas dorsolateral neurons in both nuclei project to caudal
      retrosplenial cortex. LD neurons display a different topographic organization.
      The neurons in the medioventral part of LD project primarily to the rostral
      retrosplenial cortex, and the neurons in lateral LD project to the caudal
      retrosplenial cortex. This latter projection to the caudal retrosplenial cortex
      is also contributed to by neurons residing in the mediodorsal part of caudal LD. 
      The neurons in AM that project to the retrosplenial cortex display less
      segregation than the AV, AD, or LD neurons. In all experiments, a number of
      neurons in the dorsal ventro-anterolateral nucleus were labeled by retrosplenial 
      injections. The largest number of cells in this nucleus were labeled after Rag
      injections, and these were topographically organized such that the neurons
      projecting to the rostral Rag were located immediately deep to the internal
      medullary lamina, and the neurons projecting to the caudal Rag were more
      ventrally located. Very few thalamic neurons have axon collaterals to different
      areas of the retrosplenial cortex as shown by double labeling experiments.
      Together, these results demonstrate a highly organized thalamic projection to the
      retrosplenial cortex.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of pralidoxime chloride in the rat.
PG  - 2263-9
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) was studied in rats.
      Different groups of rats were given an intramuscular injection of 2-PAM at one of
      three doses (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg). This range of doses is used commonly in
      studies concerned with the efficacy of 2-PAM against poisoning by potent
      organophosphorus inhibitors of cholinesterase enzyme. Individual, sequential
      blood samples were collected during the course of the experiment. From these
      blood samples the plasma concentrations of 2-PAM were determined over time for
      each animal. Next the relationship of plasma concentration to time was expressed 
      in terms of a standard pharmacokinetic model. Estimates of various
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using an open, one-compartment model: 
      volume of distribution (Vd), maximal plasma concentration (Cmax), elimination
      rate constant (k10), absorption rate constant (k01), area under the curve (AUC)
      and clearance (CL). Of the pharmacokinetic estimates, only Cmax and AUC were
      found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.0001) when compared across
      all the doses; these pharmacokinetic estimates were highly correlated with doses 
      with r = 0.998 and r = 0.997, respectively. However, when AUC and Cmax were
      normalized by dividing through by dose, no significant differences were found in 
      the transformed data. The results of this study in rat indicate that the
      pharmacokinetics of 2-PAM is linearly related to dose in a range employed in
      therapeutic studies of 2-PAM.

TI  - Proenkephalin A-like mRNA in human leukemia leukocytes and CNS-tissues.
PG  - 2237-41
AB  - Total RNA has been prepared from human leukocytes from patients with chronic
      lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) as well as from post mortem human caudate nucleus,
      hypothalamus, cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Dot-blot and Northern blot
      analysis, using a human proenkephalin A clone and SP-6 derived "complementary"
      proenkephalin A RNA respectively, revealed the existence of proenkephalin A-like 
      RNA:s in CLL-leukocytes with the same characteristics as in caudate nucleus,
      hypothalamus, and cortex. Furthermore, RIA and Western blot analysis confirmed
      that immunoreactive pro-enkephalin A activity is present in human CLL-leukocytes.
      The progress in DNA recombinant technology has allowed the study of opioid
      peptide regulation at the transcriptional and translational-posttranslational
      level. Studies on the distribution and quantitation of preproenkephalin A mRNA in
      bovine, rat and human central nervous system (CNS) have recently been reported.
      Different opioid peptides, related to the enkephalins, dynorphins and
      beta-endorphin have also been detected in tissues outside the CNS including the
      adrenal medulla and in pheochromocytomas. Northern blot analysis and cDNA-cloning
      confirmed that the proenkephalin A gene is indeed expressed in these tissues.
      Proenkephalin A derived peptides are potentially significant in nervous
      disorders. We have chosen to investigate whether the corresponding gene is
      expressed not only in CNS-tissues but also in human leukocytes, cells readily
      obtained in individual patients.

TI  - Uridine enhances the cytotoxic effect of D-glucosamine in rat C6 glioma cells.
PG  - 2221-7
AB  - This paper studies the influence of uridine on the effects exerted by
      D-glucosamine in rat C6 glioma cells. 2 mM uridine increased markedly both the
      cytotoxic effect of the aminosugar and the inhibition of thymidine incorporation 
      into acid-insoluble fraction. Furthermore the complete resumption of the capacity
      to incorporate either 3H-thymidine or 3H-mannose which was observed after the
      removal of the aminosugar, was impeded when the cells were treated
      contemporaneously with D-glucosamine and uridine. An exposure for 4 hr to 20 mM
      glucosamine alone enhanced about 15-fold the cellular pool of
      UDP-N-acetylhexosamines; the addition of 2 mM uridine intensified the expansion
      of this pool, which became about 35-fold the control value. The findings suggest 
      a connection between the accumulation of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines in the cells and
      the appearance of D-glucosamine cytotoxicity.

TI  - Stimulation of phosphatidylinositol metabolism in atrial and ventricular
      myocytes.
PG  - 2215-20
AB  - Receptor-stimulated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids was studied in atrial
      and ventricular myocytes isolated from guinea-pigs. Membrane phospholipids were
      labelled with [3H] inositol and their conversion to [3H] labelled inositol
      phosphate was measured in the presence of Li+ (10 mM). In the absence of added
      stimulatory hormones or neurotransmitters, little inositol phosphate accumulation
      was observed. Acetylcholine and carbachol stimulated inositol phosphate
      accumulation with a maximum of more than 12 times the unstimulated values in
      atrial myocytes and 7 times in ventricular myocytes. The EC50 values and 95%
      confidence limits for acetylcholine and carbachol were 0.9 microM (0.2 - 5.3) and
      8.8 microM (6.3 - 11.8) in atria and 0.6 M (0.5 - 0.8) and 10.0 M (1.8 - 55.9) in
      ventricles, respectively. Oxotremorine was a partial agonist in stimulating
      inositol phosphate accumulation in both atrial and ventricular myocytes. The
      vasoactive peptides angiotensin II and vasopressin also stimulated inositol
      phosphate accumulation but the maximum effect was lower than that mediated
      through muscarinic receptors. However, the adenosine analogues,
      L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine and 5'N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine which, like
      muscarinic agonists depress cardiac contractility, did not affect inositol
      phosphate accumulation at concentrations up to 10(-4)M.

TI  - Pineal function during ethanol intoxication, dependence, and withdrawal.
PG  - 2209-14
AB  - Pineal melatonin and serotonin content were determined during one to four days of
      continuous intoxication, and during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The
      nocturnal rise in pineal melatonin was blunted in continuously intoxicated
      animals, however this was found to be unrelated to duration of treatment. The
      initial dependent-intoxicated phase of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome produced a
      reduction of nocturnal pineal melatonin content with a concomitant elevation in
      pineal serotonin. The overt withdrawal phase of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome
      had no effect on pineal melatonin or serotonin content. This data suggests that
      ethanol may perturb pineal melatonin synthesis either directly, or indirectly by 
      altered receptor function. Contrary to our expectations the pineal may not be a
      useful model to probe the physiology of increased noradrenergic neurotransmission
      produced by ethanol withdrawal.

TI  - The effect of alpha-interferon, cyclosporine A, and radiation-induced immune
      suppression on morphine-induced hypothermia and tolerance.
PG  - 2191-7
AB  - An interconnection between the immune and the central nervous systems has been
      suggested by investigators studying the actions of several types of immune
      modifying agents and procedures upon opiate related phenomena. These studies have
      included the effects of altering immune system function by administration of
      either alpha-interferon, cyclosporine or radiation exposure upon
      naloxone-precipitated opiate withdrawal and upon opioid antinociceptive effects. 
      The present study extends these earlier investigations by examining the effect of
      immune modulation upon opiate induced hypothermia. The results demonstrate that
      interferon and cyclosporine have no effects on baseline temperature or morphine
      induced hypothermia, while irradiation exposure elicits hyperthermia without
      affecting morphine-induced hypothermia. Finally, neither cyclosporine nor
      irradiation affect the development of tolerance to morphine induced hypothermia, 
      while a single injection of the immune system modifier interferon was able to
      prevent the development of such tolerance. These observations suggest that yet
      another opiate-related phenomenon may be regulated at least in part by the immune
      system. These results together with our previous findings are further evidence of
      a link between the immune system and the CNS mediated through the opioid system. 
      In addition, these studies further support our earlier hypothesis that
      "Interferon" is one of the endogenous substances which serves to prevent the
      development of tolerance and dependence to endogenous opioids.

TI  - The role of dopamine in behavioral supersensitivity to muscarinic antagonists
      following cholinesterase inhibition.
PG  - 2169-76
AB  - The role of brain dopamine (DA) in the enhancement of muscarinic
      antagonist-induced hyperactivity was investigated. The effects of atropine and
      scopolamine on the concentrations of DA and its metabolites,
      dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), following DFP
      administration were determined. In control animals, atropine and scopolamine
      decreased the concentration of DA and increased the ratios of DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA
      in the striatum, but not in the N. accumbens - T. olfactorium (mesolimbic) area. 
      Following a single dose of DFP, the two antimuscarinic drugs caused decreases of 
      DA and further increases of the above ratios in both brain regions. However,
      following repeated DFP treatment for 2 weeks, these antimuscarinic drug-induced
      changes were observed only in the mesolimbic area, but not in the striatum. It is
      suggested that an increased DA turnover, indicated by elevated DOPAC/DA and
      HVA/DA ratios, underlies the muscarinic antagonist-induced hyperactivity. The
      well-known occurrence of muscarinic receptor down-regulation after DFP
      administration, could be responsible for the enhancement of the actions of
      muscarinic antagonists in DFP-treated animals. The observed differential effect
      on DA turnover in the two broad areas may involve both muscarinic and DA
      receptors.

TI  - Olivocochlear neurons in the squirrel monkey brainstem.
PG  - 246-58
AB  - Centrifugal projections from the brain to the cochlea have been well described in
      rodents and cats. In order to gain a better understanding of the general
      mammalian features of this efferent projection system--the olivocochlear (OC)
      system--we have begun to extend its description to other mammalian orders,
      particularly primates. This report describes the origin, cellular morphology, and
      cholinergic nature of OC neurons in squirrel monkey. Olivocochlear neurons were
      identified after cochlear injection and subsequent retrograde transport of one of
      the tracers, horseradish peroxidase, True Blue, or Diamidino Yellow. One series
      of sections was processed to demonstrate the tracer and an adjacent series was
      processed to demonstrate acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In some cases, a series of 
      sections was immunohistochemically processed to identify the presence of choline 
      acetyltransferase (CAT), the synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine. Approximately
      1,700-1,800 OC neurons were contained in five distinct regions surrounding the
      major nuclei of the superior olivary complex (SOC), namely: dorsal to medial
      superior olive (MSO); between MSO and lateral superior olive (LSO); lateral to
      LSO; medial to SOC; and in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VTB). These
      neurons were larger in the regions dorsal to MSO, lateral to LSO, and within VTB;
      they tended to be smaller in the regions between MSO and LSO and medial to SOC.
      Neuronal shapes varied among regions and included oval, elongate, round, and
      multipolar cells. In further support of their cholinergic nature as implied by
      AChE reactivity, OC neurons also stained positively for the cholinergic marker,
      CAT.

TI  - Localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in type 3 cells and demonstration 
      of their source to F2 terminals in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus: a
      Golgi-electron-microscopic GABA-immunocytochemical study.
PG  - 228-45
AB  - Postembedding immunocytochemistry with a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antiserum
      was done on semithin sections of cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) previously 
      processed with the rapid-Golgi and gold-toning procedures, to determine which of 
      the three main morphological types (1, 2,3) of neurons in the A-laminae show
      immunoreactivity and are, therefore, presumably GABAergic. Only type 3 cells were
      found to be GABA positive. These cells were characterized by small somata and
      few, scarcely branched dendrites bearing almost exclusively appendages with long 
      slender stalks. Some of these cells have extensive filiform "axonlike" processes 
      originating from different regions of dendrites and having appendages similar to 
      those originating directly from dendrites. Many of these Golgi gold-toned
      impregnated dendritic appendages of type 3 cells were analyzed in the electron
      microscope and were identified as typical F2 terminals by their content of
      pleomorphic synaptic vesicles; by being postsynaptic to retinal (RLP), cortical
      (RSD), and perigeniculate (F1) terminals; and by being presynaptic to dendrites. 
      In addition, since it was previously demonstrated that glutamic acid
      decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA-positive cells are not retrogradely labeled with
      horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from the visual cortex, the present results, by
      showing that GABA-positive cells have type 3 morphology, provide supporting
      evidence for the interneuronal nature of type 3 cells in cat LGN.

TI  - Cardiovascular effects of adenosine infusion in man and their modulation by
      dipyridamole.
PG  - 2229-36
AB  - In man, intravenous infusion of adenosine has been useful in inducing sustained
      hypotension during anesthesia. Bolus injections terminate supraventricular
      tachyarrhythmias by delaying AV node conduction. It has been proposed that some
      of its cardiovascular effects are related to inhibition of noradrenergic
      neurotransmission. We assessed the cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal effects of 
      intravenous infusion of adenosine (10 to 140 micrograms/kg/min) in 7 conscious
      normal subjects. At the highest infusion rate achieved, adenosine increased heart
      rate by 33 bpm (p less than 0.005), increased systolic blood pressure by 13 mm Hg
      (p less than 0.02) and decreased diastolic blood pressure by 8 mm Hg (p less than
      0.02). Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine increased 44% and 213% respectively.
      Basal plasma renin activity was 0.7 +/- 0.09 ng AI/ml/hr and remained unchanged. 
      Higher doses were not given due to the appearance of subjective side effects
      (headache, nervousness, flushing and an urge to breathe deeply). During
      dipyridamole administration, 4-fold lower doses were required to produce
      equivalent cardiovascular effects. We conclude that in conscious man, intravenous
      infusion of adenosine is associated with activation rather than inhibition of the
      sympathoadrenal system. The possible mechanisms of this sympathetic activation
      are discussed.

TI  - Induction of turning by direct intrastriatal injection of dopaminomimetic drugs
      in mice: pharmacological analysis of a simple screening model.
PG  - 2199-208
AB  - A new simple model designed for the screening of dopaminomimetic drugs in mice is
      presented. When injected directly into the right striatum of conscious mice, the 
      dopamine (DA) receptor agonists apomorphine, SKF 38393 and bromocryptine, the
      indirect DAmimetic drugs (+)-amphetamine and nomifensine, the atypical DAergic
      antidepressant drug minaprine, induced contralateral rotations. Rotations induced
      by DA mimetics were antagonized by i.p. injected haloperidol. A pretreatment with
      the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (s.c.) antagonized the turning induced by apomorphine
      or by the D1 agonist SKF 38393, and, to a lesser extent, that induced by the D2
      agonist bromocryptine. In contrast, the D2 antagonist (-)-sulpiride (i.p.)
      blocked the effects of the 3 agonists to the same extent. A pretreatment with
      alpha-methylparatyrosine (i.p.) antagonized rotations induced by bromocryptine,
      (+)-amphetamine and minaprine, but not those induced by nomifensine or
      apomorphine. The results suggest that this model could represent a useful
      screening tool for the search of new DAmimetic drugs, and for the assessment of
      DA receptor blockade.

TI  - Neuropeptide Y normalizes renin secretion in adrenalectomized rats without
      changing blood pressure.
PG  - 2161-7
AB  - In the periphery, neuropeptide Y is present in plasma, in the adrenal medulla as 
      well as in sympathetic nerve endings and in the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The
      aim of the present study was to assess the effect of this peptide on renin
      secretion. Normotensive rats were adrenalectomized or sham-operated and made
      hypertensive with methylprednisolone acetate (20 mg/kg s.c. once weekly).
      Deoxycorticosterone pivalate (10 mg/kg s.c. once weekly) was also given to
      prevent mineralocorticoid deficiency. Two weeks after initial surgery, 12
      adrenalectomized and 8 sham-operated conscious rats were infused for 30 min with 
      neuropeptide Y (0.1 micrograms/min) whereas 8 other adrenalectomized and 9
      sham-operated conscious rats received under similar conditions the vehicle of
      neuropeptide Y (10 microliter/min). Neither before nor during the infusions was
      there a significant difference in blood pressure and heart rate between the 4
      groups of animals. Plasma renin activity, measured at the end of the infusion,
      was 30.5 ng/ml/hr in the adrenalectomized group receiving vehicle and 6.3
      ng/ml/hr in that infused with neuropeptide Y (p less than 0.001). This latter
      value did not differ from that found in sham-operated rats. These results suggest
      that neuropeptide Y may play an important role in regulating renin secretion.

      study.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - By means of scanning electron microscopy, the differentiation and maturation of
      sensory hair bundles have been studied in the ampullar cristae of the mouse
      during development from gestational day 13 (GD13) to postnatal day 10 (PD10). Two
      gradients of ciliary differentiation were demonstrated, one from the apex to the 
      base and the other from the center to the periphery. The different hair bundles
      that appeared on the crista during the fetal period originated in an initial
      ciliary stage found in regions undergoing differentiation, differentiation, which
      was visible at the apex of the crista starting on GD14. This stage of ciliary
      development is gradually followed by a juvenile one at GD15. Starting on GD18,
      the maturation of hair bundles in the central apical area differed from that in
      the peripheral areas and prefigured the regional specialization of the crista
      found in the adult stage. In the discussion, we suggest that when the vestibular 
      epithelial cells begin to exhibit ciliary differentiation, they are
      simultaneously contacted by nerve fibers.

TI  - Neurotoxic action of kainic acid in the isolated toad and goldfish retina: II.
      Mechanism of action.
PG  - 196-208
AB  - The specificity and mechanism of the neurotoxic action of kainic acid (KA) was
      investigated by histological methods in the isolated retina of toads and
      goldfish. Particular attention was paid to the earliest and most sensitive
      response to KA in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Of 21 compounds tested as
      potential mimics of KA neurotoxicity in the OPL, only the enantiomers of
      glutamate and aspartate mimicked KA, inducing a low-level neurotoxic effect at
      concentrations 5,000-10,000-fold higher than concentrations of KA giving
      comparable effects. Further, of 22 compounds tested as potential blockers of KA
      neurotoxicity in the OPL, only D-gamma-glutamylglycine, D,L-alpha-amino pimelic
      acid, sodium pentobarbital, D,L-alpha-amino adipic acid, L-glutamate, and
      L-aspartate blocked KA neurotoxicity (IC50 values of 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 2, 5, and 15 
      mM, respectively). In ionic substitution experiments, KA-induced vacuolization
      was found to require sodium and chloride ions but not calcium ions in the
      extracellular medium. These findings support the hypothesis that KA combines with
      specific receptors in the membrane of susceptible neurons in the retinal OPL,
      leading to prolonged opening of membrane channels permeable to sodium and
      potassium ions. An accompanying equilibrating chloride influx may result in
      intracellular ion excess, leading to osmotic swelling and vacuolization. The
      membrane receptors involved in mediating the action of KA in the OPL are likely
      to be a class of postsynaptic or extrasynaptic glutamate receptor.

AB  - The neurotoxic action of kainic acid (KA) was investigated by histological
      methods in the isolated retina of toads and goldfish. Particular attention was
      paid to the earliest and most sensitive response to KA in the outer plexiform
      layer (OPL). KA caused vacuolization of proximal and distal segments of
      horizontal cell dendrites in the OPL as well as perikaryal vacuolization and/or
      chromatin clumping in selected classes of neurons in the inner nuclear layer.
      Further, KA caused vacuolization and swelling in the inner plexiform layer. These
      effects were very similar in the retinae of goldfish and toad. The extent of
      vacuolization in the OPL was graded with KA concentration and with length of
      incubation. For 15-minute incubations, half-maximal vacuolization was found at
      10-20 microM KA. At 25 microM KA, OPL vacuolization was evident within 1-2
      minutes of application of KA. In goldfish, but not in toad, rod-connecting
      dendrites were less sensitive to KA than cone-connecting dendrites.

TI  - Determination of plasma [18F]-6-fluorodopa during positron emission tomography:
      elimination and metabolism in carbidopa treated subjects.
PG  - 2243-52
AB  - An investigation of the metabolism of [18F]-6-fluorodopa (FDOPA) given to
      carbidopa treated subjects for scanning by positron emission tomography (PET) has
      been carried out by analysis of plasma. Reverse phase ion pair HPLC and alumina
      extraction were employed to fractionate and identify the [18F]-labelled compounds
      of plasma over a two hour period. During this time, the plasma levels of both
      total 18F and FDOPA decreased as a bi-exponential function of time. The rates of 
      18F, but not FDOPA, elimination were observed to decrease with age. In addition
      to FDOPA, only one other major peak of radioactivity was resolved by HPLC.
      Identification of this compound as the O-methylated derivative of FDOPA (MeFDOPA)
      is based on its shared HPLC elution time with in vitro synthesized
      O-[methyl-14C]-FDOPA. The ratio of the concentration of MeFDOPA to FDOPA
      (MeFDOPA/FDOPA) in plasma increased linearly with time, and the slope of this
      linear relationship decreased with the age of the individual.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of calcitonin on adenylate cyclase activity in different rat
      brain areas.
PG  - 2253-62
AB  - We have investigated the effect of calcitonin (CT) on adenylate cyclase in
      membranes from different rat brain areas. Salmon calcitonin (sCT)
      dose-dependently inhibited the enzyme activity in midbrain, hypothalamus,
      medulla, pons and caudate nucleus, but was ineffective in adenohypophysis. The
      inhibitory effect was enhanced by GTP. Comparison of calcitonins of different
      origin indicated that sCT was the most potent in inhibiting the enzyme in
      hypothalamic membranes, eel CT (eCT) was slightly less potent, and human CT (hCT)
      was ineffective. Chronic I.C.V. pretreatment with sCT did not modify the
      subsequent in vitro sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to sCT. It is concluded that
      some of CNS actions of CT might involve modulation of intracellular cAMP levels.

TI  - In vivo atrial peptide-venodilation: minimal potency relative to nitroglycerin in
      dogs.
PG  - 2177-84
AB  - Venodilation is thought to contribute to the hemodynamic actions of atrial
      peptides. Therefore, we measured the effective vascular compliance (EVC) as a
      parameter of overall venous tone in 7 pentobarbital anesthetized dogs under
      autonomic blockade during i.v. infusions of rat atriopeptin II (AP II, up to 100 
      pmol/kg/min), rat alpha-atrial natriuretic factor, and nitroglycerin (GTN). AP II
      lowered mean arterial pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance with a 
      threshold between 3 and 10 pmol/kg/min (but was ineffective in anesthetized or
      conscious dogs without autonomic blockade). Neither atrial peptide altered EVC,
      while GTN augmented EVC and caused a 4.6-fold larger reduction of central venous 
      pressure than AP II at equihypotensive dosage. These findings, with infusion
      rates probably close to endogeneous release, reveal a vasodilator potency of
      atrial peptides, which is restricted to systemic arterioles without affecting
      venous tone.

PG  - 2185-9
AB  - A rapid, simple and sensitive assay has been developed for
      tyrosine-3-monooxygenase, the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in
      catecholamine biosynthesis. The assay is based upon the release of 3H2O from
      3H-[3,5]-L-tyrosine with adsorption of the isotopic substrate (and its
      metabolites) by an aqueous slurry of activated charcoal. This method routinely
      yields low blank values and is simpler than the procedure requiring the use of
      cation exchange columns to separate the isotopic substrate from the 3H2O formed
      during the hydroxylation reaction.

PG  - 2153-9
AB  - Evidence is presented that the small peptides MIF-1/Tyr-MIF-1 are part of an
      endogenous antiopiate system that may function to balance the opiate system. We
      review the biological activity, behavioral activity, and functional effects of
      this proposed opiate antagonist system. In addition, we suggest, based on
      antinociceptive mechanisms, that the individual components of the antiopiate
      system might function differently from naloxone.

TI  - Pallidal neurons in the rat.
PG  - 209-27
AB  - The globus pallidus has been examined in rat brains with Golgi methods. Most of
      the impregnated cells, the typical pallidal neurons, have relatively large cell
      bodies and thick, infrequently branched dendrites that are several hundred
      microns long. Most dendrites have one or two spines, some of them are moderately 
      spiny, and a few are quite spiny. Although the dendrites generally end by simply 
      becoming thinner and beaded, they occasionally form special dendritic
      ramifications, which are similar to the complicated dendritic endings reported in
      primate brains. The variability in the size of the somata and in the structure of
      the dendrites is not sufficiently consistent to permit dividing the neurons into 
      distinctive subsets. However, two forms of dendritic trees can be defined. The
      neurons in the center of the pallidum have radiate dendritic trees, whereas the
      cells along the borders have compressed dendritic trees. Two axonal patterns have
      been seen: ones with and ones without collaterals. All of the axons are beaded.
      Two other cell types were found. The special border cells along the external
      medullary lamina in caudal pallidum have dendrites that extend for some distance 
      into the caudate-putamen. They otherwise resemble typical pallidal neurons. Small
      neurons that were infrequently impregnated may be interneurons, but their axons
      were not visualized. Their dendrites are short, varicose, and have a few spines. 
      The spherical dendritic trees have a radius of 150-170 micron. Two sorts of axons
      that are probably afferent fibers were observed. The more common ones are
      nonbeaded, thin axons that have several boutons en passant and collaterals spaced
      along their length. In comparison, the other afferent fiber has numerous
      swellings, boutons en passant, and collaterals that are crowded together. They
      appear to invest the dendrites closely.

TI  - A relationship between diffusional transport in lipid membranes and a
      lipophilic-eutectic parameter.
PG  - 367-75
AB  - A theoretical model has been developed to relate passive diffusional transport
      with a parameter termed the lipophilic-eutectic coefficient, Le. Based on this
      parameter it is proposed that the lipophilicity of a substance can be estimated. 
      The method is based on the melting point lowering of a pure substance in the
      presence of an impurity of similar structure. Cholesterol was chosen as a model
      biological lipid because it is a neutral lipid that is found in relatively high
      concentrations in a variety of membranes. Transdermal absorption in humans and
      intestinal absorption in the rat both show a high degree of correlation with
      respect to Le. For our studies, Le appears to be as satisfactory as the partition
      coefficient for estimating lipophilicity and its determination is less demanding 
      analytically.

TI  - ESS equations sometimes do not specify an ESS.
PG  - 325-31
AB  - The equations used to find an evolutionarily stable strategy in the basic game
      theory model (Maynard Smith, 1974, 1982; Maynard Smith & Price, 1973), and in
      sexual conflict models (Maynard Smith, 1977; Parker, 1979) do not, in fact,
      specify an ESS when the expected number of contests entered is not the same for
      each strategy. This means that the conclusions of many game theory models may be 
      incorrect. This is particularly likely to be true when the mean durations of
      contests for different strategies are not the same, or when the probability that 
      an individual enters a contest is not the same for all strategies. New ESS
      equations are developed which incorporate the expected number of contests
      entered.

TI  - Advantages to mutagenesis techniques generating populations containing the
      complete spectrum of single codon changes.
PG  - 261-79
AB  - The limitations of current mutagenesis techniques are analyzed in terms of the
      number and kinds of codon changes they make and in terms of the population size
      needed to produce all single or multiple amino acid variants. It is shown how a
      technique that can alter a single codon of a gene, producing all possible variant
      codons without affecting the rest of the gene, has certain advantages, if it can 
      be used at each place in the gene in one experiment. Such a technique has
      advantages when the goals are to understand: (1) how specific structural
      alterations in a mutant protein cause it to function in a different but specific 
      way, (2) how to predict which amino acids in a protein contact or interact with
      each other, and (3) why a protein is more or less sensitive to mutational
      disruption, depending upon the specific mutation. This is because it would
      generate the maximum number of (1) mutant proteins with different functions, (2) 
      intracistronic suppressor for any starting mutation, and (3) random amino acid
      substitutions at random places. Furthermore, such a technique could produce
      useful variants more quickly and on a smaller scale than either evolution or
      current methods.

TI  - The basis of synchronization by repetitive dilution of a growing culture.
PG  - 333-46
AB  - Cultures of Escherichia coli have been synchronized by periodic dilution with
      fresh growth medium in the laboratory of Francois Kepes. When diluted by a large 
      factor into complete test medium, the treated cultures undergo up to 12
      synchronous divisions. This long term synchrony must result from an adjustment
      process during the periodic dilution procedure so that all cells have nearly
      identical biochemical properties. Robert Pritchard (University of Leicester,
      personal communication) suggested that this phasing would happen if the uptake of
      a critical nutrient was limited by the surface area of the cell during a portion 
      of the dilution cycle. If his suggestion is valid, a general method for
      synchronization of almost any organism that grows exponentially and divides by
      binary fission into equal sized daughters should be achievable. A computer
      program was devised to simulate the growth of an initially asynchronous culture
      under periodic dilution with medium containing a single limiting nutrient.
      Various models of cell shape and growth were tested along with various models for
      the growth-limiting substrate uptake.

TI  - Probability of quantal transmitter release from nerve terminals: theoretical
      considerations in the determination of spatial variation.
PG  - 289-304
AB  - The release of transmitter occurs in discrete quantal units, such that the number
      released (m) is equal to the number available (n) times the average probability
      of release (p). Although a common method of estimating these parameters is to use
      simple binomial statistics, results may be biased if there is spatial or temporal
      variation in n and p (vars p, vart n, vart p). The problem arises in the
      simultaneous analysis of five variables, which is impractical due to the
      complexity and margin of error involved. The proposed solution is to eliminate
      two variables (vart n, vart p) by assuming stationarity and to obtain the
      required information from the first three moments of m. The resulting quadratic
      equation gives two solutions, p1 and p2. Computer simulation of quantal output as
      a function of vars p indicates that p1 is the better estimator of p when vars p
      is small, but that p2 is better when vars p is large. This changeover or
      "inflection" occurs at points which correspond to the maximum vars p obtainable
      by unimodal distributions of p (larger vars p being obtained by bimodal
      distributions). Comparison of the simulated histogram of m with those predicted
      by p1 and p2 shows that p1 provides the better fit, whether vars p is large or
      small. This discrepancy indicates that histogram analysis is unable to
      distinguish the appropriate estimate. The major limitations in the procedure can 
      be met by assuming (1) stationarity (which can be attained and tested
      experimentally), and (2) normal distribution of p (since vars p is then less than
      "inflection" point, p1 will always be the correct estimate). The overall findings
      demonstrate that vars p and unbiased estimates of n and p may be calculated,
      provided reasonable assumptions are made. This in turn should allow the continued
      use of quantal parameters for describing transmitter release.

PG  - 45-52
AB  - The Health Care Financing Administration is in the process of designing a
      competitive bidding model for the purchase of outpatient clinical laboratory
      services. One segment of this process involves the development of a relative
      value scale (RVS). The RVS could be used as part of the bidding process and as
      the basis of payment. The RVS could also be used as the basis of a national fee
      schedule, as stipulated in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. Potential problems 
      with the development of an RVS from local (carrier) fee schedules for outpatient 
      clinical laboratory services were investigated.

PG  - 134-41
AB  - Thirty surgery patients between 4 and 12 years of age were interviewed
      preoperatively to assess their knowledge about medical instruments (e.g., the
      identity and function of an anesthesia mask). Self-report measures of anxiety
      were also obtained. Qualitative and quantitative age differences in children's
      understanding of medical instruments were noted, but no age differences were
      detected in overall level of anxiety or in the rank ordering ot items considered 
      least and most anxiety provoking. Children who were most anxious appeared to have
      the least understanding of medical instruments. These findings are discussed in
      terms of the literature on providing children with medical information.
      Recommendations for preparing different-aged children for medical procedures are 
      offered.

      expert opinion.
PG  - 167-82
AB  - The growing number of applications for both new and existing technologies will
      act as a catalyst for major changes in the diagnostic testing field over the next
      decade. The most important single factor affecting diagnostics, however, will be 
      the increasing restrictions on reimbursement for diagnostic tests as traditional 
      payers become much more cost conscious. After decades of growth, we should see a 
      gradual decline in absolute numbers of diagnostic tests and procedures by the
      early 1990s. The locations of pathology testing may change as well. Free-standing
      labs will continue to grow in importance while the number of tests in hospitals
      will decline as hospital admission volumes fall. The number of tests in the home 
      will grow dramatically but will remain a relatively small part of the whole. In
      diagnostic imaging, rapid growth will occur in the use of some of the newer
      specialized procedures, but the use of traditional x-rays is likely to fall off
      slightly. The share of procedures done in hospitals will drop, and the share done
      in diagnostic imaging centers will show a corresponding growth. These changes are
      likely to mean fewer radiologists and pathologists, tougher questions about
      administrative allocation of flat-rate reimbursements, a shift of focus in
      medical specialist education, and a shift in the role of medical specialty
      societies.

TI  - The insurance industry and the coverage of rehabilitation services.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - Rehabilitation facilities are inescapably involved in the ongoing national debate
      over the financing and delivery of health care services. The relatively small
      portion of the debate involving our facilities does not involve questioning the
      need for rehabilitative medicine in serious trauma or illness, rather, the
      discussion revolves around how the services can best be delivered and the cost
      containment of the inherent costs. The recent interest evidenced by the
      government in DRG and related prospective payment plans is credited by some with 
      effectively slowing the increase in health care costs. We believe that a careful 
      look beyond just the numbers could demonstrate that cost "savings" are simply
      cost shifting to private payers. We believe that if DRG plans are strictly
      applied to rehabilitation facilities the results could be detrimental to both the
      facilities and their patients. Potential new markets are being explored such as
      the role our facilities can play in the area of treatment of catastrophic injury 
      resulting from third party negligence. Liability litigation involving bodily
      injury is an area of enormous concern for the nation and its liability insurers, 
      as is evidenced by the increased media attention given to the "liability
      insurance crisis" recently. The obvious long term cost containment effects of
      treatment in rehabilitation facilities is attracting the attention of the
      liability insurers as a potential vehicle by which liability exposures can be
      mitigated. The emergence of profit driven health care corporations and the
      enormous competition accompanying it is one of the most significant developments 
      to be considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Urban and rural hospitals: how do they differ?
PG  - 77-85
AB  - When the Health Care Financing Administration implemented the Medicare
      prospective payment system (PPS), the payment rates for inpatient hospital
      operating costs were derived on an urban and rural basis within each region. The 
      rates were also adjusted for area wage levels and other factors affecting
      hospital costs. The effect of PPS on rural hospitals is of widespread interest.
      This article provides data on rural and urban hospital facilities, utilization,
      and charges, as of April 1985. Almost 48 percent of the 5,821 short stay
      hospitals included in the PPS recalibration file for Federal fiscal year 1984 are
      located in rural areas. Rural and urban areas are designated by the Executive
      Office of Management and Budget or, in some instances by regulation.

TI  - Status of the Medicaid competition demonstrations.
PG  - 65-75
AB  - In 1982, the Health Care Financing Administration approved funding for
      demonstration programs in six States to test a variety of alternative delivery
      strategies for Medicaid recipients. A number of innovative health service
      delivery features have been used in these programs, including competition,
      capitation, case management, and limitations on provider choice. These strategies
      have been tried in order to address the key Medicaid problems of cost containment
      and access to appropriate and high quality care. This article provides an
      overview of how the demonstration sites have approached the task of designing,
      developing, and implementing their various programs.

TI  - Simulating the impact of case-mix adjusted hospice rates.
PG  - 53-64
AB  - The Medicare hospice benefit prospectively reimburses hospices based on the
      inpatient status of the patient, whether or not the patient is at home, and
      whether the patient is receiving round-the-clock nursing. Using national Hospice 
      Study data, two case-mix adjusters based on patient functioning and living
      arrangement were found to be significantly related to per diem cost. These were
      tested by simulating their impact on hospice revenues. Increasing per diem
      reimbursements 35 percent for nonambulatory patients living alone only increases 
      hospice revenues by 4 percent; hospices with sicker patients benefit the most.

TI  - Reimbursement under diagnosis-related groups: the Medicaid experience.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - The implementation of the Medicare prospective payment system has sparked the
      growth of similar Medicaid systems. Eight State Medicaid agencies now employ a
      system based on diagnosis-related groups (DRG's), and another four State Medicaid
      agencies are planning to implement such systems in the near future. The eight
      DRG-based systems in existence in 1986 are examined in this article. Preliminary 
      evidence presented herein indicates that Medicaid DRG-based systems have
      experienced reduced rates of increase in expenditures for hospital services and
      that hospital admission rates have not increased under these systems.

TI  - Capitation pricing: adjusting for prior utilization and physician discretion.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - As the number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving care under at-risk capitation
      arrangements increases, the method for setting payment rates will come under
      increasing scrutiny. A number of modifications to the current adjusted average
      per capita cost (AAPCC) methodology have been proposed, including an adjustment
      for prior utilization. In this article, we propose use of a utilization
      adjustment that includes only hospitalizations involving low or moderate
      physician discretion in the decision to hospitalize. This modification avoids
      discrimination against capitated systems that prevent certain discretionary
      admissions. The model also explains more of the variance in per capita
      expenditures than does the current AAPCC.

AB  - Nationwide, 8 percent of all employment-related health plans were self-insured in
      1984, which translates into more than 175,000 self-insured plans according to our
      latest study of independent health plans. The propensity of an organization to
      self-insure differs primarily by its size, with large establishments more likely 
      to self-insure. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the self-insured benefit
      was hospital and/or medical. Among employers who self-insure, 23 percent
      self-administer, and the remaining 77 percent hire a commercial insurance
      company, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, or an independent third-party administrator
      to administer the health plan.

TI  - Marketing of social services gains prominence in practice.
PG  - 41-52
AB  - The author reviews the growth and development of social marketing practice as a
      social work strategy and describes how the different categories of marketing
      correspond to administrative, planning, and community organization practice. She 
      illustrates the similarity between the social planning process and the market
      planning process in an effort to demonstrate that social marketing is a useful
      addition to decision making and planning in social service agencies. Social
      marketing theory, diffusion theory, and exchange theory provide the theoretical
      frameworks for the argument developed. Drawing upon these theories, the paper
      draws attention to the fact that marketing is rapidly gaining acceptance as a
      viable strategy in macro practice designed to attract and retain consumers of
      services, develop resources, and inform service providers and practitioners of
      practice issues and innovations.

TI  - Funding human services: fixed utility versus fixed budget.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - It is argued in this paper that government allocations for human services based
      on inputs rather than outcomes, reduce efficiency in social and health service
      provision. An alternative system of budgeting or contracting on the basis of
      cost-per-closed case and case outcome is discussed. An interdependency between
      fixed budget and fixed utility models of allocation is affirmed. The locus of
      decision-making for operationalizing this interdependency is seen as the program 
      and budget review panel to which operating agencies and government departments
      must submit financial and program accounting information from year to year. In
      isolation, the fixed budget approach degenerates into routine allocation or
      contract renewal with a focus on such input and output variables as volume of
      service and unit cost, and the fixed utility approach, into political stalemate. 
      Simulated examples are given to demonstrate how allocation on the basis of inputs
      and outputs alone provides an incentive to inefficiency, and a fixed utility
      orientation to efficiency.

TI  - Premature infant behavior: an ethological study in a special care nursery.
PG  - 327-33
AB  - The Social and Sensory Environment Studies of very low birthweight infants have
      quantified the amount and quality of social interaction with staff and parents
      and described the sound environment in an incubator. The present study concerns
      preterm infant behavior and reactions to these stimuli with particular reference 
      to approach and withdrawal and vocalization. Among the findings are that while
      intermittent vocalization increases, infant cry decreases over the first three
      weeks in the incubator. Approach activities take place with some consistency
      whereas withdrawal differs from child to child. The ethnographic focus on
      interactive components of the intensive care experience documents the process of 
      intersubjective development for the purpose of locating and isolating points of
      vulnerability in language and cognitive skills of infants born at very low
      birthweight.

AB  - At a time of greatest need the national examination of health policy is hobbled,

      suggests brain damage. To achieve balance and appeal to reason we present this
      essay, which celebrates the nation's historic experience with public sector
      medicine and thereby serves as an antidote to the toxic maxim of received truth: 
      in matters of health, private is good and public is bad.

TI  - An annotated bibliography on respite care for children and families.
PG  - 183-6
AB  - With an increasing emphasis on home care, more and more children with severe
      disabilities and chronic-acute health impairments will be cared for at home. Care
      of these children places great financial, physical, and emotional strains on
      families. Adequate support for families is essential to prevent costly
      rehospitalization, foster placement, or worse. Respite care is a supportive
      service that is an important part of every effective plan for home care. This
      bibliography offers annotations on a range of materials directly addressing or
      closely related to the topic of respite care for children and families. The
      bibliography will be useful for the reader searching for general material on the 
      topic as well as the reader interested in specific aspects of respite care,
      including family perceptions, program models, funding issues, and training.
      Annotations on articles, reports, books, and some government materials are
      provided. Additionally, a listing of training materials, and where they can be
      obtained, is provided without annotations after the bibliography.

PG  - 168-73
AB  - The paper covers the historical evolution of children's health care beginning in 
      antiquity and proceeding into the present. Various themes emerge including the
      indifference of society to children and the overt acts of infanticide and child
      abuse. By the 18th century new information in the field of medicine and chemistry
      led to improvements in the physical care of children. A spirit of humanism and
      the rise of the health professions joined forces in the late 19th century to
      institute important changes in the health status of children. Finally, several
      current national trends are discussed in light of their potential impact on child
      health care.

TI  - Twenty years of pediatric thanatology.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - Although the term thanatology was coined in 1912, the study of death and dying in
      childhood was out of fashion until the 1970s. The pendulum then swung, and there 
      was a shift from avoidance of the issue to its becoming almost a fad. During the 
      past 10 years, successful research of previously fatal malignancies and more
      careful and complex studies of children's and parents' reactions to serious
      illness have given the opportunity to provide wiser care for these patients and
      their families.

AB  - This study was undertaken to aid Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Alabama in
      determining an equitable dispensing fee and to examine profitability in the study
      pharmacies. A 25 percent random sample of community pharmacies (independent,
      chain, professional, and independent discount) in Alabama was studied, indicating
      an average breakeven cost to fill a prescription of $3.04. Pharmacy profitability
      was derived from the prescription department, with the front-end merchandise (all
      non-prescription items) contributing negatively to profitability in the average
      community pharmacy.

AB  - Tobacco production and consumption is on the increase in developing countries. It
      is imperative that effective demarketing of tobacco products be initiated. This
      will call for effective and credible role models. A major study conducted in
      Dhaka, Bangladesh indicates that doctors are the most credible source of
      information concerning the dangers of tobacco consumption. Campaigns utilizing
      elderly male doctors as role models are called for in working to correct to
      problem of tobacco used in developing countries.

TI  - Educating today's students to practice pharmacy in the 21st century: reaction
      from the perspective of continuing education.
PG  - 373-4
AB  - In summary, I have described changes which will occur within continuing education
      to better prepare the pharmacy school graduate to practice in the 21st century.
      One level of change deals with an attitude toward lifelong learning which in turn
      affects the efficiency of continuing education. Although some effort to address
      this issue currently takes place at the undergraduate level, students in the
      coming years will witness an increased effort recognizing the importance of
      lifelong learning with appropriate sensitization and nurturing of self-directed
      study skills to assist in the lifelong learning process. The second level of
      change focuses on sophistication within CE and involves a significant change, at 
      least by some providers, in program content which will be more rigorous and
      tailor-made in the needs of individual practitioners. Through increased
      efficiency and sophistication, continuing education will be perceived differently
      in the 21st century. Rather than a current view of continuing education as one of
      many types of postgraduate education and training, continuing education will be
      viewed as a learning process which encompasses or includes all other types of
      postgraduate education and training.

PG  - 1-8
AB  - The current trend of health care cost containment has paved the way for
      innovative program development, utilizing current staff as well as introducing
      new professionals to traditional health care settings. Work capacity evaluation, 
      physical capacity evaluation, and work hardening programs are proving to be
      lucrative ventures for capturing the worker's compensation market. These programs
      will increase their solvency as industrial injuries continue to rise, and
      insurance companies continue to seek objective work functioning evaluation units 
      to clarify patient return-to-work potential. With these new program efforts,
      vocational evaluators and vocational rehabilitation counselors will assume their 
      traditional roles in new rehabilitation settings. As long as hospitals continue
      to focus on out patient treatment programs, and insurance companies procure
      objective work evaluation and treatment program services, the market place for
      vocational rehabilitation professionals will continue to expand.

PG  - 7-11
AB  - Major changes have taken place in medical care in the past few years, including
      the way in which we pay for health care. Blue Cross and Blue Shield have kept
      pace with these changes through the development of HMOs, PPOs and more recently
      through Managed Care Benefits. They have been innovators in providing quality
      care at the lowest possible price, and have diligently attempted to unite the
      interests of physicians, institutions and employers for the benefit of the
      patient/employee. The following article describes how Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
      have participated in this process.

PG  - 23-5
AB  - Except for a common mission in caring for patients, physicians and hospitals have
      frequently been on opposite sides of the health care fence, fulfilling objectives
      that were at many times opposite each other. Since the Medicare program started
      in 1966, however, physicians and hospitals have entered a new era heralded by
      cooperation and mutual respect. With the rapidly changing health care
      environment, confusion and frustration have challenged that relationship. The
      following article calls for a renewed cooperation between hospitals and
      physicians and proposes a method to try to achieve stability within the market.

AB  - In today's health care environment, the hospital's relationship to its medical
      staff can mean the difference between success and failure. As opposed to the
      current system, the medical staff of the future must be organized and strong, yet
      flexible enough to undergo the changes necessary for "venturing." This article
      describes how one University Medical Center organized its physicians and medical 
      staff to meet the changing needs of the surrounding Texas community and the
      organization itself. Focusing on today's health care environment and the concept 
      of venturing, this article unveils the special relationship between a medical
      center and its medical staff.

TI  - Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York.
PG  - 17-9
AB  - Today in the health care field, one must expect the unexpected. In this respect, 
      HMOs are no more immune than any other sector of the health care market place. In
      fact, one could argue that in managing an HMO in the present environment, one is 
      at the very eye of the storm. Ten years ago, no one in the HMO industry could
      have realistically expected that national HMO enrollments would be in excess of
      21 million by 1986, that there would be competition between as many as 20 HMOs in
      a single market, or that the fastest growing segment of the HMO field would be
      HMOs representing investor-owned, IPA-based chains. Whether change of this
      magnitude was ever anticipated is not the real issue; rather, the issue is how
      organizations meet the challenge of change and whether they succeed or fail. The 
      following article describes the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP), 
      a long established HMO, and its plans to maintain its market share in this
      changing health care environment.

AB  - It has been predicted that by the year 2000, there will be 25 health care
      conglomerates dominating the health care field. This prediction is based upon
      today's trends in the marketplace. The current rush to establish affiliations and
      cooperatives is a foreshadowing of the future. In the face of such revolutionary 
      change, it is imperative to keep in mind that health care is best delivered on a 
      local level. The author examines one such system, the American Healthcare
      Systems, located in Los Angeles, California, and how they intend to be pioneers
      of the future.

TI  - Office visit patterns in physician group practices.
PG  - 13-21
AB  - In summary, this study provides evidence that with as few as five diagnosis it is
      possible to identify some physician group practices that consistently treat
      patients with more or fewer visits, on average. However, even among group
      practices that vary considerably in size, location, and organizational structure,
      there is little deviation from the norm in terms of office visits. A study of
      more than 30 patients per site using data from both office records and insurance 
      claims is needed, however, to examine the entire spectrum of treatment, including
      lab tests, special procedures, medications, and hospitalization. Such future

TI  - Mexican immigration and health care: a political economy perspective.
PG  - 344-52
AB  - This paper examines the case of Mexican immigrants in the United States and their
      access to medical services within a political economy of health framework. Such
      an approach stresses that the provision of health care is independent of health
      factors per se and that access to health care is not equally distributed
      throughout a population. The first section reviews the three major concepts
      influencing medical anthropologists working within a political economy framework:
      the social origins of illness; the allocation of health resources; and fieldwork 
      in Third World countries. The analysis then focuses upon the reasons for limiting
      immigrants' access to health care, followed by an examination of the
      socioeconomic characteristics of Mexican immigrants, including an undocumented
      immigration status, which limit their access to health care. Finally, the
      consequences of limited access to health services are suggested, including a low 
      utilization of preventive health services resulting from the high cost of care
      combined with the immigrants' generally low income, lack of medical insurance and
      fear of using U.S. health services.

TI  - Financial issues for hospital auxiliaries.
PG  - 8-9
AB  - Auxiliaries can serve a more important financial role in today's environment than
      ever before. Hospitals are searching for positive avenues to promote themselves
      to the community and to generate more financial support to help offset the losses
      created by decreasing inpatient utilization and payments from third-party payers.
      Auxiliaries should recognize that their financial role has never been more
      important to the financial viability of their hospitals. Auxiliaries should
      communicate closely with hospital administration so that both organizations work 
      to achieve compatible goals. Auxiliaries should be operated more like businesses,
      which means establishing goals and objectives, preparing effective budgets and
      interim financial statements, thinking and planning innovatively, and
      establishing adequate inventory controls, investment policies, and pricing
      structures. If auxiliaries follow these steps, they will not only succeed in
      providing more financial support to hospitals than ever before but will also
      receive the recognition and support they deserve for their effort.

TI  - Can we predict the patient who leaves against medical advice: the search for a
      method.
PG  - 33-6
AB  - Previous attempts to determine a profile of the typical patient who leaves
      against medical advice (AMA) have been largely unsuccessful. The premature
      separation from the hospital arouses unresolved feelings in everyone involved,
      including the patient, and is expensive as well. The theory that a patient left
      AMA as a result of a malfunction in the contracting process on admission was not 
      replicable in our institution. We found that the largest group of patients
      leaving AMA was the young male substance abuser, who is usually the most
      unpopular type of patient. We believe that staff, actively or passively,
      encourage patients that they do not like to leave AMA. This interpersonal process
      may be the one which most needs addressing.

AB  - This study describes a prospective six-month follow-up study of previously
      hospitalized psychiatric patients. Data are presented on social functioning and
      symptomatology derived from self-report scales administered to 60 patients. there
      was significant improvement in both symptomatology and social functioning on
      follow-up for all groups with the exception of the schizophrenic group, who
      exhibited little or no change. Residual change scores revealed more than expected
      change in 71 percent of schizophreniform patients, 70 percent of nondepressed
      patients, 53 percent of depressed patients, but only 20 percent of schizophrenic 
      patients. These findings suggest that most patients sustain improvement after
      discharge and that many schizophreniform patients may have good prognoses.

PG  - 21-5
AB  - Because there is debate about the benefits of hospitalization for the suicidal
      patient, it is vital that issues relating to the assessment and treatment of such
      patients be studied. Research studies, chiefly arising from the Menninger Suicide
      Research Projects, are summarized as they focus on these issues. Why particular
      kinds of hospital treatment can benefit the seriously suicidal patient and why
      certain treatment philosophies can seemingly increase the risk of death are among
      the issues discussed. Clinicians are urged to sharpen their assessment questions 
      and to develop a focused, articulated understanding of the circumstances which
      might precipitate a suicidal crisis as well as the particular aims of the act for
      a given individual.

      needs, rights, and dignity of the individual are recognized and respected within 
      the caring context. Both guardians and discharge planners must try to achieve
      these ends by striking a sensitive balance between political direction, societal 
      trends, individual rights, and organizational values and realities. There are
      still more questions than answers in this area, more issues to be resolved.
      Guardianship has been well received in Alberta, and is demonstrating that it can 
      and ought to be a key element in the case-planning process.

TI  - Integrating knowledge and behavior: development of a management and career
      development program for graduate health administration education.
PG  - 7-30
AB  - How best to integrate cognitive learning and behavioral skills in health
      administration education has been a concern of both academics and practitioners
      for many years. Charged with the education of health care administrators,
      graduate programs are expected to produce persons who are both knowledgeable
      about the field in which they plan to be employed and skilled in carrying out the
      many tasks associated with successful performance in their future roles. This
      article describes the theoretical basis and design of the management and career
      development offering (MCDO) of Widener University's Graduate Program in Health
      and Medical Services Administration, the key objectives of which are to integrate
      cognitive learning with practical experience and to provide a mechanism for the
      development of needed professional skills in a low-risk academic atmosphere. It
      was clear that these objectives could not be achieved entirely within a
      traditional academic curriculum, nor were they always appropriately treated
      there. However, the complexity of the health care field, the growing demands
      placed on administrators, and conflicts arising within and between roles increase
      the necessity to integrate these theoretical and behavioral skills.

TI  - Applied research as a problem-solving tool: strengthening the interface between
      health management and research.
PG  - 31-44
AB  - If applied research is to serve as a tool for solving health care delivery
      problems in developing countries, researchers and managers must work more closely
      together. At present, research efforts are often directed toward issues and
      problems of marginal interest to health managers, and research focused on
      problems important for health delivery often does not capture the attention of
      those who could most profitably use its results. This paper examines some reasons
      for the lack of utilization of research and discusses strategies such as training
      to promote use of applied research for problem solving, orienting decision makers
      to applied research, and strengthening the use of research in health services
      management, with examples drawing on the experience of organizations involved in 
      the development of applied research programs.

TI  - Telling it to Studs Terkel: HMPRG at age five.
PG  - 4-13
AB  - After five years, the Health and Medicine Policy Research Group, out of
      generosity or vain-glory, has come to believe that its health policy
      interventions are a moveable feast. In what follows, the nation's premier
      interviewer extracts from three HMPRG stalwarts the history and the style of work
      which, up to this moment, has proven remarkably productive for us. Please presume
      this interview is an invitation to readers wherever you may be to inquire and
      seek counsel about how what we have been able to do might be replicated in your
      city. The interview was aired on WFMT's Studs Terkel Program of January 6, 1986. 
      Patricia Terrell, Executive Director of HMPRG, John McKnight, Professor of Urban 
      Policy at Northwestern University and a co-founder of the group, and Quentin
      Young, former Medical Director of Cook County Hospital and President of HMPRG,
      answered, as best they could, Studs Terkel's interrogatories.

TI  - A disease in the house of medicine.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - For good reason the costs and casualties of medical malpractice have really
      earned the often overused sobriquet of "crisis." Invariably the debaters assert
      that the public's interest is best served by their program and their exchanges
      are not merely rhetorical, given the intense legislative activity on the
      "reforms" aggressively pushed in most of the nation's state capitals. The
      question of what is in the best interest of the public traverses a minefield of
      competing interests. The plaintiff's lawyer bias of Mr. Petty's article moved us 
      to follow up with a brief commentary which raises some other criticisms. As a
      metaphor for many health policy issues, the tensions around malpractice will
      receive continuing attention in these pages.

TI  - "Young healers": chronically ill adolescents as child life assistants.
PG  - 174-7
AB  - An innovative summer program that employs chronically ill adolescents as child
      life assistants is described. This program helps the chronically ill teens better
      cope with their chronic illness while at the same time allowing them to be
      "helpers" to other adolescents. Funding, supervision, and dealing with problems
      are discussed as they relate to this unique approach to providing child life
      services. The authors feel that this program directly addresses three areas of
      concern and stress in the lives of the chronically ill adolescents: (a) poor body
      image, (b) social isolation, and (c) issues of self-control.

TI  - Is automated urinalysis in your laboratory's future?
PG  - 201-10
AB  - Examination of the urine, possibly the earliest diagnostic test in medicine, has 
      only recently benefited from automation; one previous twentieth-century advance
      was substitution of specific reagents for earlier nonspecific chemical tests that
      were subject to interferences. In the mid-1970s, semiautomated urinalysis
      instruments were developed to read and record chemical test reactions used in
      manual urinalysis. Further, in 1984 the first instrument coupling automated
      intelligent microscopy (AIM) with a dipstick reader became available, fully
      automating both the biochemical screening and microscopic examination of urine
      specimens. This assessment describes AIM, as embodied in the Yellow IRIS
      instrument, and also discusses alternative strategies that laboratorians are
      developing to improve the cost effectiveness of conventional urinalysis.

TI  - Noninvasive bone mineral assessment.
PG  - 183-200
AB  - With increased public awareness of the hazards--and possible prevention--of
      osteoporotic fractures, the demand for bone mineral measurement procedures has
      also increased. The early methods for assessing bone mass noninvasively were
      based on radiography; recently, radioisotope and computed tomography techniques
      have been developed to overcome the technical limitations of plain radiographs.
      The available technologies can be distinguished by their ability to measure
      either the vertebrae or limbs, areas of the body with markedly different bone
      physiology. Now, the selection of a bone mineral assessment modality for a
      particular individual depends upon the importance the physician places on the
      need to measure the potential fracture site directly. In those instances in which
      the examination of the forearm provides sufficient information, such as in
      screening the elderly, single photon absorptiometry is likely to be chosen. Where
      a more direct measurement of vertebral or femoral bone mineral content is
      required, such as for diagnosis of disease or monitoring therapy, either dual
      photon absorptiometry or quantitative computed tomography will be the final
      choice, depending on which is ultimately proven the better predictor of hip and
      spinal fractures.

TI  - Swiss Hospital Institute's approach to the problems of magnetic resonance
      imaging.
PG  - 157-66
AB  - The Swiss Hospital Institute, a nonprofit institution that provides guidance on
      hospital planning and operation to Switzerland's health care community, conducted
      in 1984 a comprehensive study of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy via a 17-member commission that examined all aspects of
      these emerging technologies. Future MRI utilization was estimated by developing
      five clinical categories of possible MRI use, based on ICD codes, and a
      probability of MRI utilization was developed for each category. By applying these
      probabilities to the number of inpatient admissions in each category, an annual
      nationwide volume of 20,000 scans was estimated. Ten MRI systems were considered 
      adequate for a period of up to five years after the report's promulgation, based 
      on a per-system annual throughput of 1,900-2,000 patients. A
      superconducting-magnet system with an 0.5-T field strength was deemed the most
      suitable, with units to be located in university hospitals. [Spectroscopy was
      considered best left to separate research installations.] The cost of equipment
      and construction for the 0.5-T superconducting magnet system were calculated as
      high as 3.6 million Swiss francs (Sfr) (approximately $1.65 million at fall 1985 
      exchange rates). the annual operating cost was estimated as Sfr 1.3 million
      ($600,000). On this basis a per-study fee of Sfr 690 ($315) was projected. The
      study recommended health insurance coverage of MRi use, only in patients with
      well-proven clinical indications for an MRI scan. The report is expected to aid
      in the orderly introduction of MRI into Switzerland's health care system.

TI  - Progesterone therapy in mares with abnormal oestrous cycles.
PG  - 569-71
AB  - In two studies in Holland and France a total of 41 mares found either to be in
      anoestrus or showing continuous oestrous behaviour during the early part of the
      covering season were treated with a progesterone releasing intravaginal device.
      Of the 32 mares in the first study, 24 ovulated after treatment and 11 became
      pregnant to a covering at the induced oestrus. In the second study all but one of
      the nine mares showed oestrus, seven ovulated and six became pregnant at the post

TI  - Testing for antibiotic residues in milk.
PG  - 565-9
AB  - Milk from dairy farms in England and Wales has been tested regularly for
      antibiotic residues since 1965. The sensitivity of the test organism was 0.02
      iu/ml penicillin or equivalent until the change to 0.01 iu/ml in January 1986. In
      1984-85, 99.6 per cent of the 2,000,000 milk samples tested passed the test and
      there was an average of 695 failures per month. From 7500 on-farm investigations 
      over the two years 1983-85 the most frequent reasons suggested by farmers for
      their test failures were not withholding milk for the full withdrawal period
      (19.3 to 16.5 per cent) and accidental transfer of milk (16.3 to 16.7 per cent). 
      Lactating and dry cow intramammary antibiotic preparations were held responsible 
      for rather over 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively of the failures in both 
      years.

PG  - 1739-41
AB  - Roxithromycin, a new macrolide, has favorable pharmacological properties: it is
      acid stable and well absorbed, and its prolonged half-life allows b.i.d.
      prescription of 150 mg. In our open prospective study we found an etiologic
      infectious agent in 16 (80%) of 20 patients presenting with "atypical" pneumonia.
      Ten of the 16 pneumonias were due to an organism sensitive to roxithromycin
      (gram+ cocci, gram- rods, mycoplasma and chlamydia), and 6 to a virus.
      Therapeutic success was obtained in greater than or equal to 90%. The treatment
      was well tolerated with fewer gastrointestinal disorders than with erythromycin.

TI  - [Renal involvement in Legionnaires' disease].
PG  - 1736-9
AB  - 9 consecutive cases of Legionnaires' disease are presented, all of which involved
      either a pathological urinary sediment or acute renal insufficiency. Diabetic
      glomerular sclerosis and terminal septic shock in one patient accounted per se
      for the urinary findings and terminal oliguric renal failure. In the remaining 8 
      patients the renal abnormalities are interpreted as manifestations of
      Legionnaires' disease: these were acute renal insufficiency in 6, requiring
      dialysis treatment in 4, proteinuria in 7, hematuria in 5, leukocyturia in 5 and 
      cylindruria in 3 patients. One patient died of pneumonia and one patient, without
      Legionella-related renal involvement, of septic shock. Renal histology of 5
      patients showed acute interstitial nephritis in one and diffuse sclerosing
      interstitial nephritis in a second patient, whose biopsy was obtained after 3
      months' hemodialysis treatment. In 3 patients renal biopsy findings were
      explained by preexisting renal pathology, i.e. diabetic nephropathy, chronic
      transplant rejection and shock kidney respectively. Renal failure requiring
      hemodialysis and urinary abnormalities were largely reversible.

TI  - [Vasopressin in acute myocardial infarct: clinical implications].
PG  - 1727-9
AB  - Since current data on vasopressin (AVP) secretion during the early phase of
      myocardial infarction is not extensive, plasma AVP was measured in 26 patients
      with acute myocardial infarction. Twelve had an increased AVP concentration (23.2
      +/- 7.0 pg/ml; mean +/- SEM) whereas 14 had an AVP level less than 3 pg/ml (1.96 
      +/- 0.14 pg/ml). The patients with AVP greater than 3 pg/ml had higher heart rate
      and plasma osmolality than those with AVP less than 3 pg/ml. Blood pressure
      values were the same in both groups of patients. There was no difference in peak 
      CPK and iso CPK activities between the two groups. Seven patients with AVP
      greater than 3 pg/ml died within the next few days, while only 1 patient with AVP
      less than pg/ml died. It thus appears that increased AVP concentration during
      acute myocardial infarction is associated with a poor prognosis. Whether it is a 
      cause or a consequence of an unfavourable course of myocardial infarction remains
      to be determined.

PG  - 1723-7
AB  - Sixty patients with suspected myocardial infarction were treated in an open study
      with intravenous high-dose streptokinase (1.5 million U in 70 min). The average
      delay between onset of pain and fibrinolysis was 270 min. Reperfusion parameters 
      were fast resolution of pain, rapid decline of ST elevation, arrhythmias and
      early CK peak. 27 patients were judged on the basis of these criteria as
      successfully reperfused, 13 as questionable and 20 as failures. Adverse events
      were 6 hypotensive episodes, 3 hypertensive phases, 2 interruptions due to flush,
      1 chill, and 7 minor bleeding episodes. During follow-up there were 2 early
      deaths from cardiogenic shock. 58 patients were followed for 6-41 months, during 
      which 4 died, 17 had a coronary angiogram and 6 were treated by bypass operation.
      35 patients were able to work full-time and 7 half-time. Intravenous high-dose
      fibrinolysis is harmless and can be done in community hospitals.

PG  - 1720-2
AB  - 107 consecutive outpatients were examined prospectively to evaluate the
      contribution of clinical history, ECG and chest X-ray to diagnosis of chest pain.
      Based on patient history, clinical examination, ECG and chest X-ray, 23 (21.5%)
      of all patients had chest pain related to organic disease, whereas in 84 (78.5%) 
      patients the symptomatology was of a functional/psychosomatic nature. In chest
      pain of organic origin ECG and chest X-ray contributed to diagnosis in 1/4 of the
      cases. In patients with so-called functional chest pain, ECG and chest X-ray were
      of no diagnostic value but had a psychological and therapeutic effect in a way
      that facilitated patient management.

TI  - [Thoracoscopy of pleural effusions: methods, indications, results].
PG  - 1717-9
AB  - Thoracoscopy, which was formerly used in active tuberculosis to divide
      pleuro-pulmonary adhesions and to complete therapeutic pneumothorax, has now
      become the object of renewed interest. By introducing, after pneumosera and
      usually into the 4th to 8th intercostal space in the axillary line, a fine trocar
      into the chest, the whole thoracic cavity, including parietal pleura, diaphragm, 
      lung and fissures, mediastinum and pericardium, can be explored. This technique, 
      performed under local rather than general anaesthesia or under
      neuroleptanalgesia, is innocuous, inexpensive and effective. In addition, the
      patient is immobilized for only 4 or 5 days on average and the technique is much 
      less taxing than surgery, which can be avoided in many cases. Thoracoscopy
      nowadays is mainly used to determine the cause of chronic pleurisy unexplained
      after 3-4 weeks (positive pleural biopsies are obtained in 92-97% of cancerous or
      tuberculous patients). Thoracoscopy is half-way between purely medical practice
      and surgery and deserves to be widely used again by pneumologists, provided they 
      learn to master the technique by regular, assiduous and adequate use.

TI  - Morular metaplasia of the endometrium misdiagnosed as adeno-acanthoma in a
      patient with tubal pregnancy. A case report.
PG  - 764-6
AB  - A 41-year-old woman underwent a fractional dilatation and curettage for
      menorrhagia and a diagnosis of adeno-acanthoma was made from the curettings.
      However, the subsequent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen
      revealed the presence of a clinically undiagnosed tubal pregnancy and extensive
      immature squamous metaplasia (morules) of the endometrium. No malignancy was
      present. A review of the original curettings lead to the recognition of the
      benign lesion already present at that stage. Difficulties in the differential
      diagnosis are discussed. The presence of endometrial polyps is considered as a
      possible factor responsible for the morular metaplasia rather than the tubal
      pregnancy, which seems to be a previously undescribed and interesting
      coincidence.

TI  - Occult life-threatening streptococcal septicaemia in the elderly. A report of 2
      cases.
PG  - 762-3
AB  - Streptococcal septicaemia may occur as a fulminant illness, which has a reported 
      mortality rate in excess of 80%. The organism is, however, usually highly
      sensitive to penicillin and prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy should
      reduce this. Two patients with streptococcal septicaemia who presented in shock, 
      initially thought to have a primary vascular cause, are reported. The course of
      the disease illustrates the importance of recognizing the protean modes of
      presentation of this condition and of starting appropriate therapy before
      laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis.

AB  - A case of disseminated blastomycosis is reported. The patient presented with lung
      involvement, lupus vulgaris-like lesions, mainly of the face, and subcutaneous
      abscesses overlying areas of bone destruction. The diagnosis was confirmed by
      mycological microscopy and culture of skin material from involved areas. The
      importance of early diagnosis and the favourable response to treatment are
      emphasized.

AB  - Macrodactyly simplex congenita (MSC) is a rare congenital anomaly comprising some
      10% of cases of isolated congenital macrodactyly. The essential elements in MSC
      are mentioned and a differential diagnosis from other forms of enlarged digits is
      given, in the light of the natural history of the condition. The distinction is
      shown to have practical therapeutic implications. The causation is discussed and 
      a hypothesis advanced of a possible somatic mutation in an inhibitory chalone
      receptor allowing the switch-on of unimpeded local growth.

TI  - [Cholinergic systems in bronchospasm].
PG  - 749-52
AB  - A neuronal cholinergic system is widely distributed in larger airways,
      particularly around bifurcations. These neurons form efferent pathways from the
      brainstem ending in the motor end-plate on smooth muscle, and ciliated and
      mucus-producing cells. Impulses originating in various sensory endings in the
      airways, from the central nervous system and from many sensory receptors
      throughout the body, influence the activity of the cholinergic system thereby
      controlling the patency of the airways and modulating the rate and depth of
      breathing. A non-neuronal cholinergic system present on mast cells facilitates
      their degranulation, resulting in the release of chemical mediators. These induce
      bronchospasm directly but also indirectly by activating the neuronal cholinergic 
      system. Effective bonchodilator drugs are all antagonists of the cholinergic
      system. The most effective bronchodilators, however, are physiological
      antagonists of cholinergic and all other known bronchospasm-inducing agents. Such
      antagonists include beta-adrenergic stimulants and methyl xanthines. Competitive 
      antagonists such as ipratropium which act on muscarinic receptors in the
      cholinergic motor end-plate are generally less effective. Drugs such as sodium
      cromoglycate act only prophylactically by reducing the degranulation of mast
      cells and/or minimizing irritation of airway sensory receptors.

AB  - Changes in the law related to, and the administration of, compensation under the 
      Motor Vehicle Insurance Act of 1972 are likely in the near future. This Act makes
      the treating medical practitioner an obligatory assessor of damage incurred by
      individuals entitled to compensation under this legislation by completion of an
      MVA 13 form. The value judgment of a treating practitioner and an independent
      medical assessor in defining injuries and disabilities subject to legal claims
      are discussed and 5 cases are used to illustrate the disadvantages of the
      treating medical practitioner as the definitive source of assessment
      opinion--these are lack of objectivity, perpetuation of errors of omission and
      lack of specialized knowledge. The very limited value (if any) of the MVA 13 form
      is emphasized.

      ponderal index (a measure of weight-for-height) was greatest in black females and

      suggests that there has been an increase in the mean weight of the black
      population over this period.

AB  - Low calcium and magnesium levels were found in serum from women domiciled in an
      area where an osteo-arthrosis with a female preponderance is endemic. Despite
      decreased serum calcium, the methodology used indicated low circulating
      parathyroid hormone, while values for phosphorus, total alkaline phosphatase and 
      the serum proteins were not remarkable. Alcoholism was excluded as a factor
      influencing the measured variables. The results reported, together with previous

TI  - Readmissions to a psychiatric hospital. Outcome on follow-up.
PG  - 735-9
AB  - Readmissions to South African psychiatric hospitals form 45% of their intake and 
      constitute a considerable burden on staff and facilities. The situation was
      investigated in a series of 460 patients sequentially admitted to a large,
      actively admitting hospital (Valkenberg Hospital, Cape Town). There was a
      difference in the proportion of readmissions within 1 year for different
      population groups--26,5% for white, 41% for coloured and 42% for black patients. 
      The factors influencing this are explored. There was a marked difference in
      diagnoses--schizophrenics and affective disorders being more common in the black 
      and coloured cohorts. Possible reasons for this are discussed. A 2-year
      post-discharge follow-up study showed a marked and sustained fall in the severity
      of psychiatric symptoms and difficult behaviour for all cohorts, but not of
      functional impairment, which was present in approximately 90% of all patients.
      Adequate aftercare and rehabilitation facilities in the community are evidently
      lacking.

TI  - Admissions to a psychiatric hospital. Factors associated with admission and

PG  - 731-4
AB  - A detailed cross-cultural analysis was carried out of demographic, social, family
      and diagnostic variables responsible for, or associated with, the admission of
      460 sequentially admitted patients to an area psychiatric hospital (Valkenberg
      Hospital). All patients were socio-economically disadvantaged compared with the
      population from which they were drawn and socio-economic factors played a
      significant part in admission. Larger proportions of coloured and black
      schizophrenics and substance abusers were admitted, and this is related to
      socio-economic conditions and the fact that the population generally are younger.
      There were indications that the period of inpatient stay, particularly for
      coloured and black patients, was too short in many cases for meaningful
      preparation for discharge, and that supervision after discharge was inadequate.
      Treatment of the type offered by this hospital appears largely to achieve the
      diminution or control of aberrant or difficult behaviour and symptoms while
      functional impairment is little improved.

      utensils. The solutions were analysed for sodium and glucose concentration and
      osmolality. The mother's ability to use taste as a means of avoiding

      of cane sugar in 1 litre of water provides a safe sugar/electrolyte solution.
      Taste is not a reliable method of ensuring that sodium concentration is not
      excessive.

      or recurrent tumour. The implications of this are discussed.

AB  - The clinical features of gout in men and women are compared in a retrospective
      study of hospital patients and outpatients attending an arthritis clinic. Men had
      a readily recognized pattern of disease in terms of age of onset, duration of
      disease, and tophaceous gout. Recurrent mono-arthritis of the big toe
      metatarsophalangeal joint culminating in tophaceous polyarticular gout after many
      years was a stereotyped pattern. In women, polyarticular/tophaceous disease was
      often the first manifestation of gout, and a preceding recurrent mono-arthritis
      was found in joints other than the big toe. The duration of disease before tophi 
      appeared was shorter. The use of diuretics was commonplace, and associated
      disease such as hypertension or chronic renal failure is frequent in women.

PG  - 1709-16
AB  - Malignant cells can be identified in 70-85% of all tumor-induced serous effusions
      by cytological examination. Carcinoma and malignant lymphoma can be frequently
      found in pleural fluids, while sarcoma is rare. In many cases, morphological
      criteria allow these tumors to be distinguished and may even lead to
      identification of the primary site of carcinoma. This may be of considerable
      therapeutic relevance. It may however be impossible to classify undifferentiated 
      tumors on the basis of morphology alone. In these cases a diagnosis may be
      established by immunocytochemical typing. The most commonly employed markers and 
      their applications are discussed.

TI  - [Efficient diagnosis of pleural effusion].
PG  - 1699-708
AB  - Under physiological conditions the pleural cavities contain a few millilitres of 
      a fluid film with a protein content of about 1.7 g%. Because of the different
      capillary pressure, there is a regular flow of fluid from the parietal pleura to 
      the visceral pleura. In cases of increased hydrostatic pressure or reduced
      colloid osmotic pressure in the absence of pleural disease, transudation takes
      place; in disturbances of permeability resulting from various types of
      inflammation, neoplasms or vascular disorders, and in disturbances of lymph
      backflow, exudates are formed. A pleural effusion is easily recognizable in
      typical cases. Reference is made to particular radiological manifestations which 
      are not always correctly interpreted, viz. subpulmonary effusion, encapsulated
      interlobar effusion ("vanishing tumour") and predominantly mediastinal effusion. 
      Precise examination of the neighbouring organs, together with thoracentesis and
      pleural biopsy, are decisive for the etiological diagnosis. When examining the
      effusion, it is of great importance to differentiate between transudate and
      exudate. Light's definition of transudate proved to be valid in this study
      (protein content below 3 g% and LDH index below 0.6). For the basic examination, 
      we further recommend cytology and--to save time--tuberculosis bacteriology as
      well. The significance, sensitivity and specificity of various other chemical
      tests are discussed. For diagnostic strategy it is always necessary to take into 
      consideration the entire clinical situation, including radiology and laboratory
      tests. With this proviso, a specific investigation scheme may be recommended.
      After application of the usual diagnostic methods, including pleural biopsy,
      aetiologically unclear effusions remain in about 20-25% of cases. Approximately
      2/3 of these can be diagnosed by means of optimized biopsy technique under
      thoracoscopy and are predominantly tumoral effusions. Approximately 1/3 (5-10% of
      the total number) still remain unclear as "idiopathic" effusions, even after
      thoracoscopy. The relative importance of early diagnosis of a malignant pleural
      effusion is discussed.

      goals realistic?].
PG  - 1729-33
AB  - 134 patients (11 females and 123 males, mean age 52 years) taking part in our
      rehabilitation program after myocardial infarction or bypass surgery were asked
      to say what they were aiming for as far as exercise, smoking habits and body
      weight are concerned. Follow-up was carried out by a questionnaire 6 months
      later. 120 patients (90%) were prepared to engage in some exercise on a regular
      basis. 112 (86%) of the 130 patients surviving actually met the criteria at
      follow-up. On admission 15 patients were smokers and at discharge still 12; 9 of 
      whom intended to stop smoking. This would have left a smoking fraction of 2%. At 
      the key date, however, 19% were either still smokers or had become smokers again.
      Only 43 patients were able to lose as much weight as they intended. Yet during
      the follow-up period the average weight of all patients remained constant. In
      short, the aims of our coronary patients are pitched extraordinarily high.
      Regular exercise is achieved easily, but with regard to smoking habits and
      required loss of weight the intentions are obviously somewhat too optimistic.

TI  - Eye disease at a community health centre.
PG  - 1477-80
AB  - A pilot study of eye disease was carried out over three months in a general
      practice at a London community health centre. During the study 223 patients with 
      eye symptoms attended, representing 2.7% of all medical consultations and giving 
      an annual consultation rate for eye disease of 57 per 1000 of the practice
      population. One hundred and sixty nine of these patients were seen by an
      ophthalmologist who diagnosed 43 different presenting disorders; seasonal
      allergic conjunctivitis accounted for 21% of these cases and other disorders of
      the lids and conjunctiva for 28%. The general practitioner's diagnoses were
      compared with the ophthalmologist's diagnoses in 30 cases; the principal
      differences were for specialist areas of external disease, medical retinal
      disorders, and where ophthalmic symptoms were unrelated to ocular abnormality. A 
      cost analysis showed that an ophthalmic service in a community health centre
      would be cost effective by reducing attendances at the hospital outpatient
      department.

TI  - Association between liberalization of Scotland's liquor licensing laws and
      admissions for self poisoning in West Fife.
PG  - 1466-8
AB  - Data were collected prospectively on 2868 consecutive patients admitted for self 
      poisoning between 1971 and 1982. Analysis showed a dramatic increase in the
      frequency of alcohol taken in association with self poisoning, in both sexes,
      after the liberalization of Scotland's liquor licensing laws. This increase,
      however, did not appear to affect the severity of overdoses or the outcome. Total
      admission rates for self poisoning increased with relaxation of the liquor
      licensing laws, and since overdoses associated with alcohol tend to occur at
      night these impose considerable strain on casualty departments and acute
      admitting units.

TI  - Corticosteroids and bone mass in asthma: comparisons with rheumatoid arthritis
      and polymyalgia rheumatica.
PG  - 1463-6
AB  - Bone mass has previously been shown to be reduced at peripheral bone sites in
      patients with bronchial asthma receiving corticosteroids. To assess whether total
      bone mass is reduced in asthma total body calcium was measured by in vivo neutron
      activation analysis in patients receiving various treatments for asthma and
      compared with results from normal controls and patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      and polymyalgia rheumatica. Compared with controls total body calcium was reduced
      by 13.6% (p less than 0.001) in patients with asthma receiving daily oral
      corticosteroids but by only 9.0% (p less than 0.005) in a similar group of
      patients who had received oral calcium supplements at the start of their
      corticosteroid treatment. Total body calcium was also reduced in a group of
      patients receiving only inhaled corticosteroids (8.8%; p less than 0.001) but not
      significantly reduced in a small group of patients with asthma who had never
      received these drugs. When compared with controls a group of patients matched for
      age and for dose of corticosteroids given for rheumatoid arthritis had a similar 
      reduction in total body calcium to the patients with asthma receiving daily oral 
      treatment (17.7%; p less than 0.001), but no such reduction was shown in patients
      with polymyalgia rheumatica. These findings suggest that the risk of bone loss
      with low dose oral corticosteroids in similar in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.
      Further work is required to assess the clinical relevance of small losses of bone
      associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.

TI  - Persistent HIV antigenaemia and decline of HIV core antibodies associated with
      transition to AIDS.
PG  - 1459-62
AB  - Sequential serum samples from 13 homosexual men who seroconverted for antibodies 
      to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were tested for HIV antigen. In one of
      these men, who developed the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), HIV
      antigenaemia preceded the onset of AIDS by more than a year and persisted
      throughout the course of the disease. This antigenaemia was accompanied by the
      disappearance of IgG antibody reactivity to the major HIV core protein p24. In
      none of the 12 others, who all remained without serious disease, were serum
      concentrations of HIV antigen detected, except on one occasion in one man. All
      their serum samples showed strong IgG antibody reactivity to p24. Nine children
      who were infected with HIV in 1981 by plasma transfusion from a single donor were
      also followed up for HIV antigenaemia. HIV antigen was almost constantly present 
      in the serum (26 of 28 samples) of five children who developed AIDS related
      complex or AIDS and less often in the serum (four of 10 samples) of four children
      who remained free of symptoms. The two children who developed AIDS showed a
      virtual absence of antibody reactivity to p24. These results indicate that
      increased HIV gene expression is a contributing factor to the development of AIDS
      and also provide evidence for a switch from latent to active HIV infection.

TI  - Vegetarian diet in mild hypertension: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1468-71
AB  - In a randomised crossover trial 58 subjects aged 30-64 with mild untreated
      hypertension were allocated either to a control group eating a typical omnivorous
      diet or to one of two groups eating an ovolactovegetarian diet for one of two six
      week periods. A fall in systolic blood pressure of the order of 5 mm Hg occurred 
      during the vegetarian diet periods, with a corresponding rise on resuming a meat 
      diet. The main nutrient changes with the vegetarian diet included an increase in 
      the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats and intake of fibre, calcium, and 
      magnesium and a decrease in the intake of protein and vitamin B12. There were no 
      consistent changes in urinary sodium or potassium excretion or body weight. In
      untreated subjects with mild hypertension, changing to a vegetarian diet may
      bring about a worthwhile fall in systolic blood pressure.

AB  - Active pulmonary tuberculosis is highly prevalent among the black population but 
      factors predisposing to a defective cellular immune response to the tubercle
      bacillus are not readily apparent in many. Serological evidence of a recent
      reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in such a patient could
      therefore be a relevant finding, since EBV has the potential to suppress cellular
      immune responses.

TI  - [Artificial pancreas in diabetic children].
PG  - 2159-62
AB  - The current artificial pancreases, which are not wearable, are mainly used for
      physiological research. However, they may also become useful tools for clinical
      or therapeutic investigations in diabetes mellitus. This is clearly demonstrated 
      by our own experience of the Biostator in 300 young diabetics. The steady state
      regulation of plasma glucose offers a wide range of possible investigations:
      clinical, such as measuring insulin activity in states of insulin resistance,
      urinary excretion of glucose and renal threshold; therapeutic, like evaluating
      the hypoglycemic activity of commercial insulins, or alternative routes of
      insulin administration, such as the peritoneum; physiopathological, for better
      evaluation of metabolic alterations in diabetes by measuring the turnover of
      various substrates. Experience of the artificial pancreas also appears to be
      crucial for a better handling of the many problems involved in the design of
      future wearable or implantable devices.

TI  - [Routine use of 6-month antitubercular treatment in 300 patients].
PG  - 2151-2, 2157-8
AB  - Over a 2-year period, all patients with incipient tuberculosis seen in a hospital
      unit were given a 6-month treatment consisting of rifampicine, isoniazide,
      pyrazinamide and ethambutol. A retrospective study of these 300 patients showed
      that the treatment was effective, with no failure if taken for more than 2
      months. Relapses were rare when the drugs were taken regularly, the responsible
      M. tuberculosis strain was sensitive, and there was no associated malignancy
      (present in 1.4% of the cases). The drugs were moderately well tolerated, and
      treatment had to be modified because of side-effects in 4.6% of the patients. It 
      also appeared that 57% of the patients fully complied with the prescription, and 
      16% were lost sight of by the hospital unit. Treatment was altered in 36% of the 
      cases, but in 16% changes were introduced by private doctors for reasons which
      retrospectively proved to be without medical grounds. It is concluded that this
      6-month chemotherapeutic regimen was effective in more than 98% of the cases, and
      that the main problem in management of tuberculosis is the patient's compliance
      with treatment.

TI  - [Endocavitary fulguration in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia
      complicating myocardial infarction].
PG  - 2143-6
AB  - Endocardial catheter fulguration of ventricular tachycardia consists of sending a
      defibrillating shock to the tip of an endocavitary catheter lying near the site
      of origin of the tachycardia. The shock may modify the arrhythmogenic substrate
      and prevent relapses. We have used this method in 9 cases of post-infarction
      chronic ventricular tachycardia resistant to drug therapy, and the patients were 
      be followed up for more than 2 years. The results were sometimes life-saving,
      even in cases with badly damaged myocardium. The electric shock did not
      significantly alter the myocardium but modified the arrythmogenic substrate
      enough to prevent long-term relapses. When insufficiently effective, endocardial 
      catheter fulguration can be repeated without problems. Used alone or combined
      with antiarrhythmic drugs, it opens prospects of new radical therapeutic
      approaches.

PG  - 1733-5
AB  - The renal and systemic effects of a synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
      corresponding to the sequence of the human hormone was investigated in normal
      volunteers. Each subject was infused for 4 hours on 3 different days at a one
      week interval with either ANP (0.5 or 1 microgram/min) or its vehicle. ANP
      enhanced natriuresis without simultaneously modifying glomerular filtration rate.
      ANP did, however, reduce effective renal plasma flow. In spite of the increased
      natriuresis, the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was reduced
      during ANP infusion. ANP induced a transient increase in skin blood flow. No
      change in blood pressure and heart rate occurred in the course of the experiment.

AB  - The incidence of tardive dyskinesia under neuroleptic treatment is diversely
      estimated. The effectiveness of anticholinergics in its prevention is under
      discussion. Among 52 patients treated with neuroleptics for more than 5 years
      (mean: 9 years) only 2 developed tardive dyskinesia, and the disorder was
      transient in each case. The low doses of neuroleptic drugs administered and their
      systematic association with anticholinergics seem to be partly responsible for
      this low incidence of tardive dyskinesia.

OID - KIE: 23944
OAB - KIE: Beginning in September 1987, the British public will have the right to
      consult their computerized medical records and by extension, it is expected,
      noncomputerized ones as well. The author analyzed the case notes of 100
      consecutive patients admitted under his care to a psychiatric day hospital. He
      classified material likely to affect patients adversely as puzzling or
      unintelligible, alarming, apparently insulting or objectionable, or sensitive
      information from or about others. Sergeant rejects proposals to omit sensitive
      material, to keep secret notes, or to grant access only to some psychiatric
      patients or to deny access to psychiatric patients as a class. Maintaining that
      there is no dividing line between somatic and psychological medicine, he
      concludes that access to personal health data for all patients should be limited 
      to the disclosure of bare administrative details. Further information should be
      supplied within the traditional medical consultation.

AB  - A new method based on the reported incubation period of transfusion-associated
      AIDS was used to estimate the number of AIDS cases likely to arise in the USA
      among those infected before 1986. Between 1986 and 1991 102,000 new cases are
      projected, with a total cumulative incidence of 135,000 AIDS cases. These
      estimates do not account for new infections after 1985 nor very long incubation
      periods and are thus the smallest numbers to be expected. Even if new infections 
      can be effectively prevented, the epidemic will be five times larger than the
      number of cases observed so far.

TI  - Kaposi's sarcoma: a reversible hyperplasia.
PG  - 1309-11
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma has many unusual features: for example, the pronounced male
      preponderance; its appearance in "crops" rather than as primary tumour with
      metastases; a substantial rate of spontaneous remission; the predictability of
      involved sites; the lack of aneuploidy; and the strong association with
      immunodeficiency. These features and other evidence suggest that it is not a
      malignant neoplasm but a benign, potentially controllable and reversible
      hyperplasia.

AB  - 22 patients with advanced malignant endocrine pancreatic tumours were treated
      with human leucocyte interferon 3-6 X 10(6) IU per day. Objective responses (more
      than 50% reduction in tumour markers or tumour size) were seen in 7/7 with watery
      diarrhoea/hypokalaemia/achlorhydria syndrome, 3/4 with the Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome, 6/9 with "non-functioning" tumours, and 1 with a mixed tumour mainly
      producing somatostatin. The median duration of response was 8.5 months, and all
      responders improved clinically. Adverse effects seemed more tolerable than those 
      of cytotoxic treatment.

TI  - Self-contained enzymic membrane immunoassay for detection of rotavirus antigen in
      clinical samples.
PG  - 1305-7
AB  - A self-contained enzymic membrane immunoassay (SCEMIA) system has been developed 
      for the detection of viral antigens in clinical samples. The assay system makes
      use of antiviral antibodies bound to a nylon membrane, a flow-through washing
      procedure, and a clearly visible endpoint of the enzymic reaction. A SCEMIA
      system with antibodies against rotavirus detected rotavirus antigen, within 15
      min, in all faecal samples from children with gastroenteritis that were positive 
      for antigen in a standard microplate enzyme immunoassay, which took 4 h to
      complete. In addition, the SCEMIA could detect rotavirus in faecal samples
      collected from infected individuals both before and after antigen could be
      detected by a standard immunoassay system. Rotavirus antigen was not detectable
      in control children who did not have evidence of rotavirus infection. SCEMIA
      systems are an accurate, rapid, and inexpensive means for the practical diagnosis
      of viral infections in human beings.

TI  - Effect of two years of strict metabolic control on progression of incipient
      nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetes.
PG  - 1300-4
AB  - 36 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who had 'Albustix'-negative 
      urine but raised urinary albumin excretion (30 to 300 mg/24 h) were randomly
      assigned to either remaining on conventional insulin treatment or continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion and followed up for 2 years. The insulin-infusion
      group showed a significant, sustained improvement in metabolic control, with a
      median glycosylated haemoglobin of 7.2% (range 5.9-8.8), but there was no change 
      in the conventional-treatment group (median 8.6%, range 7.2-13.4) (p less than
      0.001). Clinical diabetic nephropathy (a urinary albumin excretion rate above 300
      mg/24 h in at least two of three 24 h urine collections) developed in 5 patients 
      in the conventional-treatment group, but not in the insulin-infusion group (p
      less than 0.05, two-tailed). Fractional albumin clearance (mean and range X 10(7]
      increased in the conventional-treatment group from 160 (35-468) to 360 (29-1580) 
      and was unchanged in the insulin-infusion group (170 [31-608] before to 160
      [26-460] after) (p less than 0.05). Insulin infusion had an overall beneficial
      effect on the annual increase in urinary albumin excretion (p less than 0.05),
      and the mean glycosylated haemoglobin values correlated positively with annual
      change in albumin excretion (r = 0.57, p less than 0.0001). The diastolic blood
      pressure rose significantly in the conventional-treatment group (p less than
      0.001), and annual change in mean blood pressure correlated with change in
      urinary albumin excretion (r = 0.49, p less than 0.001).

TI  - Multicentre trial of ethamsylate for prevention of periventricular haemorrhage in
      very low birthweight infants.
PG  - 1297-300
AB  - The effectiveness of ethamsylate in the prevention of periventricular haemorrhage
      (PVH) in very low birthweight infants was evaluated by means of a multicentre,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. In 330 infants without evidence of PVH on
      initial cranial ultrasound examination there was little difference between
      ethamsylate and placebo groups with respect to subependymal haemorrhage, but
      intraventricular and parenchymal haemorrhages developed in 30/162 infants (18.5%)
      in the treated group, compared with 50/168 (29.8%) in the control group (p less
      than 0.02). The incidence of intraventricular and parenchymal haemorrhage in
      survivors was 20/137 (14.6%) in the ethamsylate group and 37/146 (25.3%) in the
      controls (p less than 0.05). In 30 infants with evidence of PVH on the initial
      scan, ethamsylate treatment seemed to limit parenchymal extension. Analysis of
      the total cohort of 360 infants showed that the proportion of infants in whom an 
      increase of two or more grades of severity of PVH was recorded during the trial
      was lower in the treated than in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). No adverse
      effects were attributed to ethamsylate therapy. The reported incidence of patent 
      ductus arterious was lower in the treated than in the placebo group (p less than 
      0.02). Mortality was similar in the two groups.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of warfarin started early after submassive venous thrombosis 
      or pulmonary embolism.
PG  - 1293-6
AB  - Two anticoagulant regimens, similar except for the timing of warfarin therapy,
      were compared in patients with clinically submassive venous thromboembolism
      (VTE). Warfarin was begun after 7 days of continuous intravenous heparin infusion
      in group L (127 patients) or within 3 days (average 1 day) of starting heparin in
      group S (139 patients), with similar outcomes. The frequency of symptomatic VTE
      recurrence during the hospital stay was 4.7% in group L and 3.6% in group S, and 
      that of symptomless new perfusion defects 8.5% in group L and 3.9% in group S. On
      routine iodine-125-fibrinogen leg scanning of patients presenting with distal
      thrombosis (in the calf, popliteal, or distal femoral veins) 3.6% of group S but 
      no group L patients had symptomless proximal extension. The incidence of bleeding
      was similar with both regimens. Outpatient follow-up showed no excess recurrent
      VTE in either treatment group. Early warfarin treatment significantly shortened
      hospital stay by an average of 3.9 days (30%) in patients admitted solely because
      of VTE.

TI  - Energy sources for detritivorous fishes in the Amazon.
PG  - 1256-8
AB  - Detritivorous fishes form an important part of the ichthyomass in the Amazon
      basin. Most of these fishes are contained in the orders Characiformes and
      Siluriformes (catfishes). The Characiformes constitute more than 30% of the total
      fish yield in the Amazon basin, whereas the catfishes are of minor importance.
      Stable isotope data indicate that Characiformes species receive most of their
      carbon through food chains originating with phytoplankton, while the Siluriformes
      receive a significant part of their energy from other plant sources.

TI  - Age of the earliest african anthropoids.
PG  - 1247-9
AB  - The earliest fossil record of African anthropoid primates (monkeys and apes)
      comes from the Jebel Qatrani Formation in the Fayum depression of Egypt.
      Reevaluation of both geologic and faunal evidence indicates that this formation
      was deposited in the early part of the Oligocene Epoch, more than 31 million
      years ago, earlier than previous estimates. The great antiquity of the fossil
      higher primates from Egypt accords well with their primitive morphology compared 
      with later Old World higher primates. Thus, the anthropoid primates and
      hystricomorph rodents from Fayum are also considerably older than the earliest
      higher primates and rodents from South America.

TI  - Petroleum associated with polymetallic sulfide in sediment from gorda ridge.
PG  - 1231-4
AB  - A sediment sample, impregnated with asphaltic petroleum and polymetallic sulfide,
      was dredged from the southern end of Gorda Ridge (the Escanaba Trough) off
      northern California, within the offshore Exclusive Economic Zone of the United
      States. The molecular distributions of hydrocarbons in this petroleum show that
      it was probably derived from terrestrial organic matter in turbidite sediment
      filling the Escanaba Trough. Hydrothermal activity at the Gorda Ridge spreading
      center provided the heat for petroleum formation and was the source of fluids for
      sulfide mineralization.

TI  - Uplifted marine terraces along the alpine fault, new zealand.
PG  - 1225-8
AB  - Three types of evidence indicate that marine terraces are widespread in the
      Southern Alps of New Zealand. (i) Remnants of shore platforms occur as distinct
      levels of notched ridge crests and flat summits; degraded sea cliffs are common. 
      (ii) Scattered quartz beach pebbles occur on 16 of 18 levels of exhumed shore
      platforms in the Fox- Franz Josef type area to altitudes as high as 1700 meters. 
      (iii) Altitudinal spacings of New Zealand terrace flights allow correlation with 
      18 dated global marine terraces at New Guinea, which were formed during
      glacio-eustatic highstands of sea level within the last 336 x 10(3) years.
      Inferred uplift rates at Fox-Franz Josef increased from 3.2 to 7.8 meters per
      10(3) years since about 135 x 10(3) to 140 x 10(3) years ago, presumably because 
      of increased convergence between the Pacific and Australian plates.

TI  - Deregulation: causes and consequences.
PG  - 1211-6
AB  - As a consequence of deregulation, there have been fundamental changes in the way 
      transportation and communications firms are conducting business. Companies are
      finding that they must be driven by market opportunities and financial needs, not
      by regulatory considerations. Prices must be based on cost, operations must
      become more efficient, and consumer-oriented product niches must be found.
      Moreover, deregulation has added a new element in industrial dynamics, by
      fostering more relations between the various modes of transportation and by
      cross-fertilization in computer and telecommunication technology. All in all, a
      more competitive and innovative spirit emerges from deregulation.

TI  - Optical experiments and weak interactions.
PG  - 1203-10
AB  - Recent optical experiments have demonstrated cases in which mirror symmetry in
      stable atoms is broken during absorption of light. These results, which are in
      contradiction with quantum electrodynamics, support the theory of unification of 
      the electromagnetic and weak forces. The interpretation of these experimental
      results is based on exchanges of weak neutral Z(0) bosons between the electrons
      and the nucleus of the atom. The information obtained from low-energy experiments
      is different from, but complementary to, the results of high-energy experiments. 
      Sensitive measurements in a simple, reliably computable atom are in quantitative 
      agreement with the standard electroweak theory and put stringent constraints on
      alternative models. Attaining sufficient accuracy in the experiments and the
      computations for the electroweak radiative corrections to manifest themselves is 
      now the challenge for experimenters and theorists.

TI  - [Value of anamnesis and the clinical stress test in the diagnosis of incontinence
      before gynecologic operations].
PG  - 805-9
AB  - In a study comprising 471 patients the clinical value of a standardized
      questionnaire (Gaudenz questionnaire) and the standing clinical stress test were 
      determined in the diagnosis of urinary incontinence. The sensitivity, specificity
      and predictive value of the positive and negative test of both methods were
      ascertained. As opposed to the final urodynamic result the clinical stress test
      alone showed a sensitivity of 48% (specificity 70%) in the diagnosis of genuine
      stress incontinence. 82% of all patients with stress incontinence were
      ascertained by the questionnaire, but only 54% were classified correctly as
      negative. The specificity of both methods combined was 94% and the predictive
      value 89%. On the other hand the questionnaire's predictive value in the
      diagnosis of urge incontinence was 9% (specificity 58%). However, the predictive 
      value of both questionnaire and standing clinical stress test, combined, rose to 
      15%. Our results statistically demonstrate that the use of both methods together 
      provides more significant information than the use of either separately.

      metastatic breast cancer resistant to standard combinations.
PG  - 790-7
AB  - 85 clinical studies concerning second-line chemotherapy of metastatic breast
      cancer have been analyzed. With minor exceptions, the mean remission rates ranged
      between 0-10% (complete remission) and 20-40% (partial remission) for the most
      commonly used second-line chemotherapy modalities. The mean duration of response 
      was 6 months, the average survival time 10 months. No significant differences in 
      effectiveness and side effects were found when comparing the different
      second-line treatment programmes.

PG  - 785-8
AB  - The separation of FIGO stage I b cervical carcinoma into a new histological stage
      I b1 and a stage I c (deep infiltration confined to the cervix) leads to an
      essential difference in therapeutic results. 5-year survival of 152 cases
      consigned to the new stage I b1 was 92%, whereas that of 95 cases of the new
      stage I c was only 77%. Hence, 5-year survival of stage I c patients is lower
      than of FIGO stage II a (83%). Contrary to our earlier practice, since 1976 all
      stage I c cases have received postoperative irradiation (Cobalt60). 5-year
      survival of 75 stage I c cases without lymph node metastasis was 83% when treated
      by surgery alone; 5-year survival of 22 similar cases treated by surgery and
      postoperative irradiation was 82%. There is no benefit of postoperative
      irradiation in cases of stage I c cervical carcinoma when the lymph nodes are not
      affected.

PG  - 315-26
AB  - Three enzymes exhibiting peptidyl-L-amino acid hydrolase and esterase activities 
      have been purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography and
      ion-exchange chromatography. The three enzymes were entirely free of the acid
      protease activity that normally exists along with them in the crude culture
      filtrates of Aspergillus niger. Although all three exo-peptidases possessed
      nearly identical molecular weights (ca. 140,000), isoelectric points (ca. 5.0)
      and other properties, their affinities for the two substrates tested,
      carbobenzoxy-L-Glu-L-Tyr and benzoyl L-arginine ethyl ester, differed. All three 
      peptidases were inhibited by phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, indicating that
      they are serine carboxypeptidases. They were also inhibited by tosyl
      phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, suggesting the presence of a histidyl residue 
      in their active sites. The differences in the number of accessible histidyl
      residues on the enzyme surfaces could explain the differences in their retentions
      on Cu2+-iminodiacetate-Sepharose 6B.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of biogenic amines and morphine in discrete rat brain 
      regions by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
PG  - 303-13
AB  - A simple and sensitive method has been developed for the simultaneous
      determination of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine,
      5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and morphine in discrete rat brain regions by
      reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical
      detection. Perchloric acid extracts of the tissue were directly injected into the
      chromatographic system. Each of these compounds gave a linear response over the
      range of 20-160 ng/ml cerebellar homogenate (0.4-3.2 ng on column). Recoveries of
      these compounds, added to the homogenates, were complete when compared with
      standards dissolved in perchloric acid. The average between-run coefficients of
      variation for all these compounds were lower than 7.4% over the range of 20-160
      ng/ml, and the within-run coefficients of variation at 20 ng/ml were lower than
      8.7%. The present method has been applied to a study of the effects of
      intraperitoneal administration of morphine on biogenic amines in several discrete
      rat brain regions.

PG  - 281-92
AB  - Coumarins, furocoumarins and pyranocoumarins (29 compounds) were investigated in 
      silanized silica (HPTLC RP-2 and RP-18 and HPLC RP-18)-water organic modifier
      (methanol, acetonitrile, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and methanol containing acetic 
      acid) systems. The physico-chemical properties of these compounds were
      characterized by their hydrophobicity parameters (RMw), determined by
      extrapolation of the linear relationships for retention data in binary solvent
      systems [RM = f(phi)] to pure water. The effect of individual substituents on
      retention was quantified by using the group contribution parameter delta RM or
      delta log k'.

AB  - A method is described for the determination of tetramethylsuccinonitrile (TMSN)
      in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) products in contact with food. TMSN was extracted
      from PVC with dichloromethane, steam distilled, extracted from the distillate
      with dichloromethane, then determined with a gas chromatograph equipped with a
      nitrogen-phosphorus detector and a 6-ft. glass column packed with Chromosorb W
      coated with 5% Thermon 1000 plus 0.5% phosphoric acid. Recoveries between 98.3
      and 100.6% were obtained in the range of 0.5-12.5 ppm of TMSN by the use of
      nitrobenzene as an internal standard. The detection limit was 0.05 ppm of TMSN in
      1 g of PVC products. The highest residue to TMSN found in PVC products in contact
      with food was 13.9 ppm.

      derivatization and capillary gas chromatography with nitrogen- and mass-selective
      detection.
PG  - 245-58
AB  - A reliable routine method is presented for the determination of piperazine down
      to the sub-ppm level in aqueous solutions and in urine. The method includes a
      two-phase derivatization procedure with ethyl- or isobutyl chloroformate as the
      reagent, followed by a capillary gas chromatographic determination using
      nitrogen- or mass selective detection. The addition of ammonia ensured a
      quantitative recovery. Detection limits for piperazine in urine were ca. 20 ng/ml
      using nitrogen-selective and ca. 1 ng/ml with mass-selective detection. The
      calibration plots were linear in the investigated range, 100-10,000 ng/ml with
      nitrogen-selective and 30-3000 ng/ml with mass-selective detection. The precision
      was ca. 6% at a concentration of 300 ng/ml. Acid anhydrides were investigated as 
      alternative reagents in the two-phase derivatization procedure, and
      heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride in aqueous solutions gave approximately 100%
      recovery. However, in urine the recoveries of the investigated acid anhydride
      derivatives were unsatisfactory.

TI  - Intermembrane protein transfer. Band 3, the erythrocyte anion transporter,
      transfers in native orientation from human red blood cells into the bilayer of
      phospholipid vesicles.
PG  - 16274-8
AB  - Band 3, the erythrocyte anion transporter, has been shown to transfer between
      human erythrocytes and sonicated vesicles (Newton, A. C., Cook, S. L., and
      Huestis, W. H. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 6110-6117). Functional band 3 becomes
      associated with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles incubated with human red 
      blood cells. Proteolytic degradation patterns reveal that the transporter is
      transferred to the vesicles in native orientation. In erythrocytes, native band 3
      is degraded on the exoplasmic membrane face by chymotrypsin and on the
      cytoplasmic surface by trypsin (Cabantchik, Z. I., and Rothstein, A. (1974) J.
      Membr. Biol. 15, 227-248; Jennings, M. L., Anderson, M. P., and Monaghan, R.
      (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9002-9010). Band 3 in intact protein-vesicle complexes
      is degraded by exogenous chymotrypsin but not by trypsin. In contrast, trypsin
      entrapped in the lumen of the vesicles proteolyses the vesicle-bound band 3
      quantitatively. Band 3 remaining in the membranes of vesicle-treated cells and in
      cell fragments is not degraded detectably by vesicle-entrapped trypsin. These
      observations indicate that band 3 is unlikely to transfer between cell and
      vesicle membranes via a water-soluble form or to adhere nonspecifically to the
      vesicle surface; the aqueous contents of vesicles and cells (or membrane
      fragments) are not pooled during cell-vesicle incubations, hence no cell-vesicle 
      fusion occurs; and the band 3 associated with the sonicated vesicle fraction is
      inserted in the vesicle bilayer in native orientation, with its cytoplasmic
      segment contacting the aqueous contents of the vesicle lumen.

TI  - Differentiation between dynamic instability and end-to-end annealing models for
      length changes of steady-state microtubules.
PG  - 16233-40
AB  - Short microtubules can be formed by shearing a sample at polymerization steady
      state of microtubules formed by glycerol-induced assembly of pure tubulin dimer. 
      Such short microtubules show a rapid increase in mean length. The rate of this
      increase is too fast to be accounted for by statistical redistribution of
      subunits between microtubules. We propose that the fast length changes are a
      result of the end-to-end annealing of microtubules demonstrated by Rothwell et
      al. (Rothwell, S. W., Grasser, W. A., and Murphy, D. B. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102,
      619-627). This proposal has been tested by measuring the rate of annealing of
      free microtubules to Tetrahymena axonemes under conditions identical to those
      used for the lengthening of sheared microtubules. That free microtubules anneal
      to axonemal microtubules is indicated by the following observations. Axonemes
      elongate at both ends in the presence of steady state microtubules, as predicted 
      for a symmetrical annealing process; under conditions where the microtubule
      number concentration is greater than that for axonemes, the initial rate of
      axoneme elongation is more rapid with a low concentration of long microtubules at
      steady state than with a high number concentration of short microtubules at
      steady state. These observations are inconsistent with the predictions of a model
      based on microtubule dynamic instability (Mitchison, T., and Kirschner, M. (1984)
      Nature 312, 237-242). The annealing rate observed with axonemes can account for
      the rate of elongation of sheared steady state microtubules.

      model.
PG  - 16226-32
AB  - The ability of 9-aminoacridine to induce mutagenic lesions during DNA replication
      in vitro was investigated. The ampicillinase gene of pBR322 was replicated in
      vitro in the presence of 9-aminoacridine. Transfection of the replicated DNA into
      Escherichia coli gave Amps mutants. Determination of the base changes in 76 of
      these mutants indicated that the spectrum of mutations induced by 9-aminoacridine
      was consistent with its action in vivo. Both large (407-base) and small (1- and
      2-base) deletions were induced at repetitive sequences. The frequency of deletion
      mutations depended on the identity of the base deleted and sequences surrounding 
      the deletions. The characteristics of the frameshift mutations induced were
      consistent with the interactions of 9-aminoacridine with DNA. These results
      establish that 9-aminoacridine can induce frameshift mutations during the
      replication process and provide an in vitro model of frameshift induction for
      mechanistic studies.

PG  - 16215-8
AB  - Recombinant human CuZn superoxide dismutase as expressed in yeast has been
      crystallized in three different crystal forms. Hexagonal plates grow from 2.4 M
      ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, and belong to the space group P6(3)22, with cell
      dimensions a = b = 113.5(3), c = 151.5(5) A, and Vm = 2.21 A3/dalton for two
      dimers per asymmetric unit. At 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, chunky wedges grow
      in space group C222(1), a = 205.2(6), b = 166.5(4), c = 145.4(4) A with a Vm of
      2.43 A3/dalton for eight dimers per asymmetric unit. With polyethylene glycol
      8000, pH 7.5-8.0, hexagonal prisms are obtained with cell dimensions a = b =
      197.4(6), c = 43.1(2) A, space group P6, and Vm = 2.53 A3/dalton for three dimers
      per asymmetric unit. All of these forms diffract to high resolution, are stable
      to x-rays, and appear suitable for determination of the atomic structure.
      Crystals of the doubly mutated enzyme (Cys6----Ala, Cys111----Ser) grown from
      both micro- and macroseeds of the wild type protein demonstrate the feasibility
      of isomorphous crystallization of site-directed mutants of the cloned parent
      enzyme for comparative structure-function studies.

PG  - 16207-9
AB  - Recombinant murine interferon-beta produced in Escherichia coli was purified and 
      crystallized in an orthorhombic space group C222(1) with a = 61.67 A, b = 55.62
      A, and c = 92.16 A. The crystals with a slight tendency for orientational
      disorder around the c axis diffract at least up to 3.3-A resolution. The
      crystallizability and the fact that the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains
      only one molecule of murine interferon-beta strongly indicate that the present
      preparation (Matsuda, S., Utsumi, J., and Kawano, G. (1986) J. Interferon Res.,
      in press) of recombinant murine interferon-beta is predominantly homogeneous with
      respect to chemical, tertiary, and quaternary structures.

PG  - 16185-90
AB  - The "neighbor relationship" of lamb thymus high mobility group (HMG) protein 17
      to native HeLa nucleosome core particle histones in the reconstituted complex has
      been studied. 125I-Labeled HMG 17 was cross-linked to core histones using the
      protein-protein cross-linking reagent 2-iminothiolane. Specific cross-linked
      products were separated on a two-dimensional Triton-acid-urea/sodium dodecyl
      sulfate-gel system, located by autoradiography, excised, and quantified.
      Disulfide bonds in the cross-links were then cleaved, and the protein
      constituents were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. HMG
      17 cross-linked primarily to histone H2A while lower levels of cross-linking
      occurred between HMG 17 and the other histones. In contrast, cross-linking
      between 2 HMG 17 molecules bound on the same nucleosome core particle was
      relatively rare. We have concluded that H2A comprises part of the HMG 17 binding 
      site. Less contact occurs between HMG 17 and the other core histones, and there
      is little contact possible between the 2 bound HMG 17 molecules. These results
      are in agreement with the current model for the structure of the nucleosome and
      the proposed binding sites for HMG 17.

TI  - Cell-cell recognition in yeast. Molecular nature of the sexual agglutinin from
      Saccharomyces kluyveri 17-cells.
PG  - 16174-9
AB  - A previous study of Saccharomyces kluyveri 17-cell sexual agglutinin
      (alpha-agglutinin), solubilized by zymolyase (beta-glucanase) digestion of
      17-cells and purified by affinity adsorption to immobilized 16-cell agglutinin
      (alpha-agglutinin), suggested that the major active component was a glycoprotein 
      of 60,000 daltons and that a minor active component of 40,000 daltons was also
      present, possibly the result of proteolysis (Pierce, M., and Ballou, C. E. (1983)
      J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3576-3582). We now show that both of these active components 
      are proteolytic fragments of a larger form with a molecular weight of 134,000,
      and that the latter is produced by proteolysis of a still larger species with a
      molecular weight of more than 200,000. Washed 17-cell wall fragments were labeled
      with 125I and digested with purified protease-free beta-1,3-glucanase, and the
      solubilized alpha-agglutinin was precipitated with antiserum raised against
      purified agglutinin containing a mixture of the 60,000- and 134,000-dalton forms.
      Gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed a radioactive material
      with Mr greater than 200,000 that, on digestion with zymolyase containing an
      active protease, was converted sequentially to radioactive components with Mr =
      134,000, 60,000, and 40,000.

      hormone. Structural studies of subunit interaction.
PG  - 16161-8
AB  - We have purified the luteinizing hormone (LH)/human choriogonadotropin (hCG)
      receptor by sequential affinity column on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose and
      hCG-Sepharose. The method was designed to allow also the purification of lactogen
      receptor from the initial starting material. The purified LH/hCG receptor
      retained full binding affinity and was identified as a single protein of Mr =
      73,000 +/- 3,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Cross-linking
      studies performed after binding of hCG to the purified LH/hCG receptor indicated 
      that the hCG alpha-subunit undergoes predominant interaction with the receptor
      molecule. The influence of the beta-subunit in this interaction seems to occur
      mainly through its association with the alpha-subunit, presumably by conferring
      specificity to the alpha-subunit for its hormonal interaction with the receptor. 
      The technique described in this study is simple and allows rapid purification of 
      microgram amounts of biologically active receptor suitable for further molecular 
      characterization, microsequencing, and functional reconstitution studies.

TI  - Compensatory increase in levels of beta minor globin in murine beta-thalassemia
      is under translational control.
PG  - 16126-32
AB  - A 3.7-kilobase pair deletion including the entire beta major globin gene results 
      in beta-thalassemia in a murine model of the disease (Skow, L. C., Burkhart, B.
      A., Johnson, F. M., Popp, R. A., Popp, D. M., Goldberg, S. Z., Anderson, W. F.,
      Barnett, L. B., and Lewis, S. E. (1983) Cell 34, 1043-1052). There is a
      compensatory increase in synthesis of beta minor globin, resulting in a beta
      minor/alpha globin ratio of 0.75 in the homozygous thalassemic mouse, as compared
      to 0.2 in the normal homozygous diffuse mouse. The results presented here
      demonstrate that the increase in beta minor globin synthesis occurs at
      translation rather than at transcription. RNase T1 analysis of reticulocyte mRNA 
      reveals that the beta/alpha ratio of globin mRNA is 0.3, significantly lower than
      the globin synthetic ratio of 0.7. However, the beta/alpha ratio of mRNA on
      polysomes is higher than unassociated mRNA, demonstrating that beta minor mRNA is
      preferentially translated. Elevated synthesis of beta minor globin is maintained 
      during in vitro translation in thalassemic reticulocyte lysate. In this system,
      partial inhibition of translational elongation by cycloheximide decreases the
      beta minor/alpha globin synthetic ratio, whereas partial inhibition of initiation
      by hemin deficiency increases the beta minor/alpha synthetic ratio. This suggests
      that beta minor mRNA competes with alpha-mRNA for a limiting mRNA binding factor 
      at initiation of translation.

TI  - Sulfhydryl oxidation induces rapid calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum
      vesicles.
PG  - 16092-8
AB  - Micromolar concentrations of cupric ion (Cu2+) and mercaptans such as cysteine,
      cysteamine, and homocysteine trigger large and rapid Ca2+ release from skeletal
      muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. At the concentrations used, Cu2+
      alone does not induce Ca2+ release nor does cysteine alone; both are required to 
      induce Ca2+ release from SR. Cu2+ is known to catalyze the autooxidation of
      cysteine to its disulfide form cystine; Cu2+/mercaptan-induced Ca2+ release
      appears to be caused by Cu2+-catalyzed formation of a mixed disulfide between the
      exogenous mercaptan and a critical sulfhydryl on a transmembrane protein. In the 
      oxidized state the SR is highly permeable to Ca2+. Supporting evidence for this
      interpretation is as follows. The order of Ca2+-releasing reactivity of the
      mercaptans is the same as the order in which these compounds undergo oxidation to
      disulfide forms in the presence of Cu2+. Ca2+ efflux induced by cysteine and Cu2+
      can be reversed by the addition of the disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol.
      Hypochlorous acid and plumbagin, both potential sulfhydryl oxidants, induce rapid
      Ca2+ efflux from SR vesicles; in addition, Cu2+, which catalyzes H2O2 oxidation
      of cysteine, enhances H2O2-induced release. Oxidation-induced Ca2+ release from
      SR can be partially reversed or blocked by ruthenium red or the local anesthetics
      procaine and tetracaine. The Ca2+ efflux rates are strongly Mg2+ dependent and
      are significantly higher in heavy SR than in light SR. These data suggest that
      the Ca2+ efflux thus induced is via the "Ca2+ release channel" and that the
      oxidation state of a critical sulfhydryl group on this protein may be the
      principal means by which the Ca2+ permeability of the SR is regulated in vivo.

TI  - Chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17. Distinct multigene families coding for
      similar types of transcripts.
PG  - 16087-91
AB  - Human nonhistone chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 are encoded by genes
      which are part of multigene families. Southern analysis of human, mouse, and rat 
      genomic restriction digests reveals that the two families are distinct. Although 
      the cDNAs of HMG-14 and HMG-17 do not cross-hybridize, they have several similar 
      structural features: the open reading frame comprises only 23% of the
      transcripts, the 5'-untranslated region is extremely GC rich whereas the
      3'-untranslated region is unusually long and AT rich. The overall sequence
      homology between the two transcripts is highest (71%) in the 90 nucleotides
      coding for the DNA-binding domains of the proteins. The sequence of the human
      HMG-14 and HMG-17 proteins, deduced from the open reading frame, differs by more 
      than 50%; the DNA-binding domains of the proteins show 74% sequence homology.
      However, even in this 30-residue long peptide there are significant differences
      between the proteins as the proline content of HMG-17 (8 residues) is twice that 
      of HMG-14. The two proteins have different hydropathy index profiles and are
      serologically distinct. The multigene families may have evolved independently
      from similar genetic elements or from a shared ancestral gene in which the
      nucleotide sequence coding for the DNA-binding domain of the protein is the most 
      conserved region. The structural differences between the molecules and the
      differences in their DNA-binding domains suggest that the proteins may be
      involved in distinguishable cellular functions.

TI  - Chromosomal protein HMG-14. Complete human cDNA sequence and evidence for a
      multigene family.
PG  - 16082-6
AB  - The isolation and sequencing of cDNA clone coding for the entire sequence of
      human nonhistone chromosomal protein HMG-14 is described. Sequence analysis
      reveals that the open reading frame constitutes only 25% of the transcript, that 
      the 5'-untranslated region is extremely rich in GC residues (75%), and that the
      3'-untranslated region is highly enriched in AT residues. The amino acid
      sequence, deduced from the reading frame, is 94% homologous to the calf thymus
      protein suggesting evolutionary constraints on the conformation of the protein.
      The human genome contains 60-90 HMG-14 gene copy equivalents which, as suggested 
      by Southern analysis, are not tandemly arranged. Northern analysis of RNA
      isolated from several sources reveals that a single-sized mRNA codes for this
      protein. Southern analysis reveals that cross-hybridizing sequences are present
      in the genome of several different species indicating that the evolutionary
      origin of this gene was over 350 million years ago. The overall features of the
      human HMG-14 cDNA are very similar to those of the human HMG-17 cDNA, and the
      number of gene equivalents present in the human genome is similar for the two
      proteins. However, their nucleotide sequence is significantly different
      indicating that the multigene family coding for HMG-14 is distinct from that
      coding for HMG-17.

TI  - Calmodulin-regulated binding of the 90-kDa heat shock protein to actin filaments.
PG  - 16033-6
AB  - We have found that the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) prepared from a mouse
      lymphoma exists in homodimeric form under physiological conditions and has the
      ability to bind to F-actin (Koyasu, S., Nishida, E., Kadowaki, T., Matsuzaki, F.,
      Iida, K., Harada, F., Kasuga, M., Sakai, H., and Yahara, I. (1986) Proc. Natl.
      Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press). Here we show that calmodulin regulates the binding 
      of HSP90 to F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The binding of HSP90 to F-actin
      occurred optimally under physiological solution conditions, i.e. in 2 mM MgCl2 + 
      100 mM KCl. The binding was saturable in a molar ratio of about 1 HSP90 (dimer)
      to 10 actins. HSP90 was dissociated from F-actin by the binding of tropomyosin to
      F-actin. Calmodulin was found to inhibit the binding of HSP90 to F-actin in a
      Ca2+-dependent manner. Moreover, the equilibrium gel filtration demonstrated that
      calmodulin binds to HSP90 in the presence of Ca2+, but not in the absence of
      Ca2+. These data indicate that HSP90 complexed with Ca2+-calmodulin is unable to 
      bind to F-actin. Ca2+-dependent interaction of HSP90 with calmodulin as well as
      calmodulin-regulated binding of HSP90 to F-actin revealed here may provide new
      insight into the function of HSP90 and the regulation of actin structure in
      cells.

TI  - Comparison of the three primary structures of deoxyribonuclease isolated from
      bovine, ovine, and porcine pancreas. Derivation of the amino acid sequence of
      ovine DNase and revision of the previously published amino acid sequence of
      bovine DNase.
PG  - 16012-7
AB  - Based on the published bovine DNase sequence (Liao, T.-H., Salnikow, J., Moore,
      S., and Stein, W. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1489-1495), the ovine DNase
      sequence is derived from the amino acid compositions of isolated short peptides
      covering all regions of the intact polypeptide. The sequence is substantiated by 
      results of automated Edman degradation of the intact polypeptide and of the two
      middle CNBr fragments, and by elucidation of the complete sequence of the
      COOH-terminal CNBr peptide. The 12 changes from bovine to ovine DNase are at
      residues 22 (Ala to Ser), 29 (Val to Leu), 35 (Val to Ala), 54 (Tyr to Asp), 62
      (Thr to Ser), 83 (Leu to Val), 121 (His to Pro), 127 (Glu to Ala), 132 (Ala to
      Pro), 159 (His to Asp), 163 (Val to Ile), and 231 (Ala to Val). A minor genetic
      variant form of ovine DNase has Val at residue 163. The data from automated Edman
      degradation of the largest CNBr peptide of bovine DNase show that the published
      bovine DNase sequence is in error and that an Ile-Val-Arg tripeptide must be
      inserted between Arg-27 and Arg-28. The corrected sequence is substantiated by
      two peptides covering this region each with three amino acids more than the
      published sequence. Comparison of the bovine, ovine, and porcine DNase sequences 
      reveals the following: with the revised bovine sequence, all three DNase
      sequences can be aligned without a gap; all three DNases have a carbohydrate side
      chain at Asn-18, but only porcine DNase has carbohydrate at Asn-106; there are 12
      changes between bovine and ovine DNases, 56 between bovine and porcine, and 50
      between ovine and porcine; there are six highly variable regions and four
      invariable ones; bovine and ovine DNases have the same length while porcine DNase
      is longer by 2 amino acid residues at the COOH terminus; the residues around the 
      nucleotide-binding site, the four pairs of salt bridges, and the essential
      His-134 groups are not changed.

TI  - Purification, characterization, and the complete amino acid sequence of porcine
      pancreatic deoxyribonuclease.
PG  - 16006-11
AB  - Porcine pancreatic DNase has been purified to homogeneity. The polypeptide
      exhibits a single band of Mr = 34,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
      gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is a glycoprotein containing glucosamine. The
      results of end group analyses show leucine at the NH2 terminus and alanine at the
      COOH terminus. The enzymatic properties of the purified porcine DNase are very
      similar to those of bovine and ovine DNases. The sequence data on the tryptic and
      chymotryptic peptides derived from CNBr fragments of porcine DNase, along with
      the results of automated Edman degradation of the intact polypeptide and of the
      two largest CNBr fragments, indicate the complete amino acid sequence of porcine 
      DNase to be as follows:L-R-
      I-A-F-N-I-R-T-F-G-E-T-K-M-S-N-A-T-S-N-Y-I-V-R-I-L-S-R-Y-D-I-A-L-I-Q-

      A-L-A-I-S-D-H-Y-P-V-E-V-T-L-K-R-A. The polypeptide consists of 262 amino acid
      residues. One of the two disulfide loops links Cys-101 and Cys-104 and the other 
      Cys-173 and Cys-209. Two carbohydrate side chains are attached at Asn-18 and
      Asn-106.

TI  - Structure of the gene for mouse thymidylate synthase. Locations of introns and
      multiple transcriptional start sites.
PG  - 16000-5
AB  - We have isolated and analyzed the structure of the gene for thymidylate synthase 
      from a 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-resistant 3T6 cell line that overproduces
      thymidylate synthase 50-fold by virtue of gene amplification. Three overlapping
      DNA segments containing the entire thymidylate synthase gene were identified in
      Charon 35 genomic libraries. Sequence analysis revealed that all of the coding
      regions were contained in a 12-kilobase segment of DNA. The gene has 6 introns
      ranging from 0.6 to 4.1 kilobases in length. The sequences at the 5' and 3' ends 
      of each intron conformed to the consensus sequences for mammalian introns. S1
      nuclease and primer extension assays showed that transcription of the thymidylate
      synthase gene initiates at several sites within a 66-nucleotide region. There are
      no TATAA or CCAAT sequences in the vicinity of the initiation sites. However, the
      region does contain DNA sequences that are known to stimulate binding of the
      transcription factors Sp1 and USF. These binding sites are adjacent to each
      other, suggesting that the two proteins may bind to the upstream region of the
      thymidylate synthase gene in a cooperative or competitive manner.
