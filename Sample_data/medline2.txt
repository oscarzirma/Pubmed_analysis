TI  - Assessment of continuing education needs and preferences of British Columbia
      dietitians and nutritionists.
PG  - 147-54
AB  - A survey was conducted among members of the B.C. Dietitians' and Nutritionists'
      Association to determine their perceived continuing education needs and
      preferences. Responses were received from 68.3% of the membership. The
      self-administered questionnaire elicited information about preferred format and
      timing of continuing education activities, incentives and deterrents to
      participation, employers' contributions to continuing education, and perceived
      need for further study of 78 topics categorized as nutritional care sciences,
      behavioural/communicative sciences and managerial sciences. Respondents indicated
      a preference for workshops, seminars and lectures, held outside of working hours.
      Topic, time and location were the major incentives/deterrents to participation in
      continuing education. Most respondents reported receiving paid time off work, but
      few reported receiving paid time off work, but few reported receiving any
      financial contribution towards their continuing education from their employers.
      Learning needs were higher for topics in the nutritional care and communication
      areas than for the managerial sciences topics. The questionnaire developed for
      this study has provided valuable information for program planners and could be
      readily adapted for use with other groups of dietitians/nutritionists.

TI  - Using computerized testing in the psychiatric hospital.
PG  - 143-5
AB  - This article addresses the uses of the computer in psychological testing and
      particularly in reference to its use in psychiatric hospitals. Psychologists have
      received the training necessary to administer and interpret psychological tests. 
      Psychological tests have been used for assessing the patient's level of
      intellectual functioning, for a better understanding of personality dynamics, for
      the recognition of organic factors affecting patients' behavior, and for making
      differential diagnoses. At present there have been numerous attempts to
      computerize the administration, scoring, and interpretation of standardized
      psychological tests, but the reliability and validity of these programs is still 
      in question. There exists a tremendous variation in the quality of the software
      products available. Other issues are who takes responsibility for the statements 
      made in the computerized report, and who administers the tests and under what
      conditions.

TI  - Hospital-based neuropsychological services.
PG  - 140-2
AB  - Hospital-based neuropsychological services may provide the hospital with a new
      means of interfacing with the general medical community, especially neurologists 
      and neurosurgeons. This could produce increased census through the evaluation and
      treatment of patients who may not have been referred to the psychiatric hospital 
      previously. Additionally, it is a service that can be marketed to the legal
      community. The establishment of neuropsychological services is a relatively
      inexpensive project that requires little in the way of physical plant and
      personnel needs other than a qualified technician and neuropsychologist.

TI  - Private psychiatric hospitals, mental health care management, and wellness: an
      interface with industry.
PG  - 137-9
AB  - Hospitals doing business is good business. Hospitals that use their professional 
      staff to enhance their interface with industry are usually pleased with the
      outcome. Health care professionals must reach beyond their doors and be willing
      to understand the needs of a large corporate bureaucracy and the aspiring
      entrepreneur. Using hospital professionals in a consultative model with
      gatekeepers of industry is an ideal way to market and enhance the hospital's
      image in the community. Professionals employed by private hospitals are usually
      quite willing to expand their roles into the community as trainers, consultants, 
      educators, diagnosticians, and treatment resource consultants to the business
      world. Business people understand business problems, and health care is a
      business issue as well as a humanitarian issue. In the current climate of cost
      containment, the hospital's ability to help the business work with paying for
      health care, if properly presented, will be welcomed.

PG  - 133-6
AB  - Expanded liaison and provision of services to local school districts may serve as
      a viable source of both revenue and broadened referral bases for a private
      psychiatric hospital. Psychologists possess skills uniquely suited to the
      evaluation, and treatment techniques necessary for the establishment of an
      assessment service, and can serve in a variety of capabilities in outpatient,
      inpatient, or consultative roles. If a facility has en existing child and/or
      adolescent program, initial start-up costs of an assessment service will be
      minimal. However, even a facility without such programs will find that the
      development of a strong school liaison will be relatively inexpensive and will
      result in both revenue generation and an expanded referral base.

TI  - The impact of a geriatric assessment unit on a psychiatric consultation service
      in a general hospital.
PG  - 121-5
AB  - The opening of a geriatric assessment unit (GAU) in a large general hospital has 
      affected the number of elderly patients referred for psychiatric consultation,
      the type of psychopathology seen, and the training provided for psychiatric
      residents and interns on the consultation-liaison service. To examine these
      changes, the six months prior to the opening of the GAU are compared to the six
      months immediately following its opening. The number of patients age 65 or older 
      referred and diagnoses made by the consulting psychiatrists were studied. The
      opening of the GAU significantly increased the number of elderly patients
      referred for psychiatric consultation. It was found that the GAU offered unique
      advantages in the assessment and treatment of elderly patients with certain
      psychiatric problems, and the advantages and limitations of different facilities 
      within the general hospital for the psychiatric assessment and treatment of
      elderly patients are discussed. A case is presented which illustrates the
      interplay between the consultation-liaison psychiatrist and the geriatric service
      in the management of an elderly patient referred for consultation. The experience
      of this hospital in providing psychogeriatric training for residents and interns 
      on the psychiatric consultation service is reviewed.

AB  - This paper is based on in-depth interviews with members of Sweden's medical
      interest groups involved in a national effort to control health care costs.
      Sweden is faced with escalating costs due primarily to a growing high technology 
      hospital sector. Simultaneously, consumer demand for primary care services and
      for gerontological care is rising rapidly. The Swedish way of changing the health
      care system is described and an analysis of the power struggle between
      physicians, health care bureaucrats and politicians is presented.

TI  - The politics of health in the Fourth World: a northern Canadian example.
PG  - 119-28
AB  - This paper describes the major structural and historical dimensions of health
      ideology and praxis in the Canadian Arctic. It examines the problems that occur
      when primary care services exclude their clients from meaningful involvement in
      planning and administration. It argues that the structure of health services in
      northern Canada reflects an internal colonial political economy which is
      characteristic of most Fourth World situations.

TI  - An innovative approach to public health research: the case of a new center in
      Mexico.
PG  - 467-81
AB  - This paper presents the conceptual and organizational elements that have guided
      the development of the Center for Public Health Research (CPHR) in Mexico. The
      CPHR was established in August 1984, in the midst of the most profound health
      care reform in Mexico in the last 40 years. The reform has included, among other 
      measures, a Constitutional amendment recognizing the social right to health care,
      an energetic effort to decentralize the system so that each state will run its
      own services, an ambitious drive to extend primary health care coverage to all
      the population, and a strong promotion of research as the basis for strategic
      planning and for the development of standards of care. The creation of the CPHR
      is a response to the need for a firm base of epidemiologic and health systems
      research in Mexico. This need arises from the increasing complexity of the
      country's organizational arrangements for health care. In addition, the patterns 
      of morbidity and mortality are also becoming more intricate, as Mexico is
      experiencing an epidemiologic transition whereby chronic diseases, mental
      ailments, and accidents are on the rise even as the incidence of infectious
      diseases and malnutrition continues to be high. As a unit of the Ministry of
      Health, the CPHR must strike a balance between relevance to decision making and
      excellence in the strict adherence to the norms of scientific research. To do so,
      it has developed a conceptual framework based on a tridimensional matrix. The
      dimensions of the matrix include substantive areas (i.e., the phenomena to be
      researched), knowledge areas (i.e., the disciplines pertinent to public health), 
      and methodological areas (i.e., the methods to be applied in each project). The
      intersection of these dimensions produces different configurations of "research
      modules" that can be adapted to changing priorities. Current priorities of the
      CPHR include epidemiologic studies of the emerging conditions in the transition, 
      migration and health, child survival, social organization and primary health
      care, health systems management, quality of care, and the development of
      information systems and quantitative models for public health research. Research 
      projects are undertaken in a matrix type of organization in which academic
      departments are structured according to problems rather than disciplines. The
      analysis of Mexico's Center for Public Health Research may contribute to similar 
      endeavors in other countries and also to the wider development of comparative
      studies on research organizations.

TI  - A population dynamics simulation model with application to health planning.
PG  - 453-65
AB  - Despite the increasing emphasis on computers and quantitative methods in health
      services programs, health services administration students are denied access to
      many of the most powerful tools of systems analysis, including discrete event
      simulation, because they lack the necessary background in computer programming,
      simulation methodology, and stochastic processes. This article presents an
      approach to the modeling of the growth and decline of population groups and their
      attributes that can be used by students who do not have the extensive
      quantitative background required to develop the usual discrete event simulation
      models. The underlying theory, which is based on the behavior of the expectation 
      process of vector Galton-Watson branching processes, can be explained quite
      easily. An example is presented that uses an age and sex specific model of
      population growth to investigate policy questions related to the feasibility of
      the construction of a long-term care facility for a defined population group.
      Planning decisions are based on the growth and decline of the numbers of
      individuals in the various age and sex groups. Extensions of the basic
      methodology are possible that would include projections of the
      variance-covariance matrix of the population sizes for each year of the
      projection process. In addition, the model can be extended to include projections
      of the impact of infectious and communicable diseases on a defined population
      group together with the effect of categorical disease screening and control
      programs. Given the basic data utilized in the model, the implementation of the
      calculations required by the model can be made on modern microcomputer hardware
      using any of the standard spreadsheet programs.

      problems. Views are presented regarding accredited graduate programs and their
      strengths and weaknesses. Recommendations are made on various issues relating to 
      the education of health services managers and include: revising curricula and
      exploring new methods of teaching health management; developing closer linkages
      with clinician educators and health managers; undertaking or expanding related
      missions of continuing professional education and multidisciplinary research and 
      evaluation. Commentary follows in response to these recommendations from the
      perspectives of education and practice.

TI  - Preferred provider organizations and antitrust policy: some recent issues.
PG  - 22-5
AB  - Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) have rapidly increased in number in
      response to soaring health care costs. Government antitrust enforcement agencies 
      have encouraged the growth of PPOs because they help bring needed competition to 
      the health care field. Antitrust problems in this area can generally be avoided
      by careful planning and counseling, but there are antitrust questions that are
      sometimes raised. Such issues include whether large PPOs can selectively deal
      with certain hospitals and refuse to deal with others; when exclusion of
      competing providers by provider-sponsored plans might be unlawful, and whether
      PPOs can be contract preclude participating providers from participating in
      competing plans. In analyzing such questions, one should look at whether there is
      an agreement among competing providers, whether the PPO has sufficient market
      power to cause anticompetitive effects, whether the restrictions in issue are
      motivated by an anti-competitive effects, whether the restrictions in issue are
      motivated by an anti-competitive purpose, and whether there are procompetitive
      (including efficiency enhancing) reasons for the arrangement. Another question
      that is frequently raised is when can provider members of a PPO jointly negotiate
      or set their reimbursement rates. The law is not clear on this subject. However, 
      if the provider members of a PPO make significant financial contributions to the 
      plan or otherwise share in the risk of adverse financial consequences resulting
      from the plan's operation, antitrust risks are lessened.

TI  - The impact of public opinion on medical technology: the case of artificial heart 
      implants.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - A public opinion survey was conducted in the spring of 1985 in Kentucky to assess
      public attitudes toward artificial heart technology. The data, based on consumer 
      and citizen perspectives, indicate that the public is interested in and aware of 
      the technology and recent implant surgeries. More knowledgeable respondents are
      more likely to support Humana's involvement, but less likely to want an
      artificial heart and other organs to continue life, and less willing to support
      equitable access and increased taxes to achieve this equity. Technological
      optimists are more willing to have the heart and other organs as needed and more 
      willing to have their taxes increased to pay for the technology for all in need. 
      Optimists also see nothing wrong with Humana's involvement in this technology.
      People's judgments on artificial heart technology vary, depending on whether they
      see it as potentially desirable for themselves as opposed to possible
      implications for others and the broader society. Although both perspectives are
      crucial for understanding the role of public opinion on the further development
      of this technology, it must be recognized that the two perspectives might have
      different impacts, depending on societal judgment of whether the decision to
      proceed with further development of the technology is mostly a public or private 
      choice.

TI  - Home care first admissions are different from re-admissions.
PG  - 29-40
AB  - Most previous papers on home care client populations, by not distinguishing
      between first and subsequent admissions, may create the impression that the
      characteristics of these two groups of patients are similar. When analysing these
      two groups from this data set separately, however, they show differences
      demographically, in length of stay, and in use of some services. Although, in
      many instances, these differences are not large, they are statistically
      significant, thus implying that type of admission i.e., first or subsequent,
      should be used routinely as a descriptive or explanatory variable in any
      analysis.

TI  - Information on wheels--library outreach.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Information on Wheels is an outreach service of the Medical College of Wisconsin 
      Libraries. A mobile cart loaded with professional books and journals is taken
      weekly to the hospital unit and outpatient clinic of the Milwaukee County
      Hospital and Froedtert Hospital. The targeted audience is primarily nurses since 
      their job demands usually allow little time flexibility, and they make up the
      largest percentage of hospital health care professionals. After one year of
      service, a survey was undertaken to determine the usefulness of the service. The 
      results were very positive. One comment repeated was, "This is an excellent
      service because it provides easy access to pertinent information to people who
      are sometimes too busy or don't think to go to the library."

TI  - Reuse and reprocessing of disposable medical devices. Legal liability issues.
PG  - 5-12
AB  - Reuse and reprocessing of disposable medical devices raises issues of legal
      liability, especially among physicians, hospitals, and device manufacturers. The 
      practice of reuse has been, at least informally, reported to be fairly
      widespread. However, the medical risks associated with reuse are unresolved in
      most cases, which may lead to circumstances conducive to litigation. In this
      paper, the characteristics of reuse pertaining to legal liability, the parties
      potentially subject to civil liability suits as a result of reuse, the legal
      theories underlying claims of injury, and the legal implications of possible
      policy actions will be examined.

TI  - The high-turnover profile. Screening and selecting applicants for nurse's aide.
PG  - 2-4
AB  - In summary, this study supports previous research and suggests that the
      high-turnover profile can be described by the following characteristics (the
      reader is reminded that these characteristics describe the sample in this study
      and cannot be readily applied to the population of all nurse's aides):
      Individuals who appeared likely to terminate employment in one year were less
      than 28 years of age, not married, and trained or educated beyond the job's
      requirements. Previous employment histories of individuals who left their jobs
      within one year indicated that they were more likely to have had less than 18
      months in previous positions, and worked in two or more nursing homes within a
      three-year period. Nursing home management may find it helpful to refer to
      high-turnover characteristics when screening and selecting applicants for the
      position of nurse's aide. Through careful selection of employees, nursing homes
      can expect a reduced rate of turnover, which may, in turn, improve the quality of
      resident care.

TI  - Validation of responses reported by school-aged siblings of hospitalized
      children.
PG  - 6-13
AB  - This study examined measurement of the effects of a pediatric hospitalization on 
      siblings using a Perceived Change Scale. Data on perceived changes in feelings
      and behaviors were obtained from 39 siblings 5 to 10 years of age in a structured
      interview and from 41 siblings 11 to 17 years of age with a questionnaire.
      Responses to the questionnaire used to assess perceived changes in older siblings
      formed a single dimension with adequate reliability, criterion validity, and
      concurrent validity. Responses to the structured interview used for younger
      siblings formed three dimensions, with a lower alpha coefficient. Suggestions for
      use of these scales are made.

AB  - Numerous projects conducted in various settings have supported the thesis that
      nature activities aid in the development of self-concept, self-confidence, and
      level of achievement. The nature activities described in this article were
      designed to cultivate the hospitalized children a sense of wonder about their
      world and to involve them in sensory experiences that would aid them in adjusting
      to their hospital experiences. As a unit, these experiments provide a
      comprehensive approach to therapy for the hospitalized child and add a positive
      dimension to the child life program.

PG  - 21-5
AB  - Materials created by patients who have undergone medical procedures and surgery
      are being used by the health team at Miller Children's Hospital to help prepare
      other children for their hospital experiences. The materials include booklets
      written by children about their tests and surgeries, drawings illustrating their 
      hospital experiences, and photographs of treatment rooms and equipment. These
      booklets are compiled, along with supplies associated with the tests and
      surgeries, into attractively decorated boxes. Case studies have shown that the
      input from peers who have created the preparation materials is well received by
      patients and has added credibility to the teaching sessions. The creators of the 
      preparation boxes have also benefitted by helping other children and by putting
      their own hospital experiences into perspective.

TI  - Anxiety of non-rooming-in parents of hospitalized children.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - This study examined levels of anxiety in 51 parents who did not room in with
      their young hospitalized children. The Spielberger State-Trait Inventory was used
      to measure parental anxiety twice, with a 3-day interval. Levels of anxiety were 
      significantly higher in parents with a greater number of children at home, less
      education, and lower social status. Findings of clinical significance were: the
      longer the child's hospitalization the more anxious parents became, especially if
      there were children at home; hospitalization of a child was more stressful for
      fathers because they maintain lower trait anxiety than mothers; and as parental
      visits to their hospitalized child decreased, parental anxiety levels increased.

AB  - Pharmacy students as well as pharmacists were surveyed on ethical dilemmas in
      pharmacy practice. The respondents indicated a high degree of concern over
      patient welfare on which there was agreement. The major area of disagreements was
      on economic concerns. Since it takes time to develop a professional ethical
      system, it seems desirable to begin discussion of ethical dilemmas as early as
      possible in the curriculum.

AB  - A drug information rotation in pharmaceutical industry may be elected as a
      component of a hospital pharmacy residency program. Program objectives include
      improving communication between the pharmaceutical industry and hospital
      pharmacy/academia, exposing the resident to the challenges the pharmaceutical
      industry encounters, improving proficiency in drug information practice, and
      providing insight into the working relationships of various departments within
      the company. During the rotation, the resident serves as a member of the Drug
      Information Service. Resident activities include participating in interviews with
      corporate professionals, updating pharmacokinetic profiles, responding to drug
      information requests and participating in other information projects. This
      rotation enables the resident to better understand pharmaceutical industry's
      concerns and relate these concerns to clinical pharmacy practice.

TI  - The design and evaluation of a clinical clerkship for hospital pharmacists.
PG  - 139-45
AB  - Forty hospital pharmacists participated in a two week pilot of a postgraduate
      clinical pharmacy clerkship, utilizing different hospital services as teaching
      sites at the University of Illinois and Cook County hospitals in Chicago. The
      clerkship provided eighty hours of instruction in the clinical setting under the 
      guidance of experienced clinical faculty. Though designed as an introductory
      clerkship for teaching basic clinical skills, general medicine floors were used
      as instruction sites as well as specialized services including emergency
      medicine, neonatology, surgical oncology, cardiology and an out-patient
      rheumatology clinic. Key findings include: the two week clerkship and its
      emphasis upon basic clinical skills was a meaningful educational experience for
      both participants and faculty; the limited time frame of the clerkships made
      crucial the instructional design including systematic development of objectives
      and faculty preparation; an improvement in participant performance on all but one
      objective was observed between the 3rd and 10th day; the clerkship enhanced the
      confidence of participants with respect to the performance of basic clinical
      skills; and the clerkship experience broadened participants' conceptions of the
      depth and scope of the clinical pharmacists role. These results indicate that a
      two week clinical clerkship can be a useful vehicle for pharmacy postgraduate
      education.

TI  - A multi-facetted approach to externship evaluation.
PG  - 111-26
AB  - The University of Toledo College of Pharmacy has developed a multi-facetted and
      dynamic system for evaluation of its Externship Program. The initial data base
      consisted of evaluation responses for individual externs, externship sites, and
      the performance records for the externship class of 1982 (N = 60/81). A list of
      behavioral objectives (competency statements) was constructed especially for
      institutional (hospital) pharmacies. A unique pre- and post-evaluation concept
      was developed as a control at each site. Externs were grouped by academic
      factors, work experience, and career plans. Each site was grouped by previous
      experience in training externs, the type of setting, and the intensity of
      service. This study discusses, summarizes, and makes recommendations from the
      results obtained through four distinct approaches.

TI  - Interpretive reporting to improve the effectiveness of clinical laboratory test
      results. An ECRI technology assessment.
PG  - 269-82
AB  - Interpretive reporting encompasses a range of efforts by the clinical laboratory 
      community to develop improved methods of transferring information from
      laboratories to physicians in a form that they can understand and use. The
      purpose of laboratory tests is to provide clinically useful information that can 
      be used to answer a specific question for the clinician. However, growing
      physician reliance on laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the increased
      testing volumes made possible by laboratory automation have yielded some
      unintended negative effects. Laboratories can now provide more information than
      can be effectively assimilated. The resulting "information overload" can cause
      clinicians to misinterpret tests, ignore significant results, or fail to act
      appropriately when results indicate a treatable condition. Research indicates,
      however, that interpretive reporting improves information transfer and thus
      increases clinicians' understanding of the significance of laboratory test
      results.

TI  - Living arrangement choices of elderly singles: effects of income and disability.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - Logit regression is used to explain living arrangement choice of elderly single
      individuals. The propensity to live independently is found to increase with
      income and decrease with disability; an interaction effect for females suggests
      that income may lessen the impact of disability on the propensity to seek shared 
      living arrangements. Independent living is less likely for people who are not
      white, foreign-born males, those with at least one adult child, and those in
      States with higher living costs; and more likely for the ever-married and those
      in States with high per capita nursing home use. If home care services are
      preferentially allocated to disabled elderly who live alone, resources may flow
      to higher income individuals who have been able to maintain independent
      households.

TI  - The right of patients in mental hospitals to refuse drug treatment.
PG  - 3-18
AB  - The use of antipsychotic drugs has caused conflicts between the medical decision 
      concerning what is in a patient's best interests and the legal decision as to
      what treatment constitutes a violation of the mental patient's right to due
      process. The medical profession has a duty to treat patients; patients have a
      right to refuse medical treatment. With legislation leading to the release of
      mental patients into the community, the focus has turned away from treatment of a
      disease and toward prevention through changes in social policy. The law has
      recognized that the state has an interest in compelling treatment and that the
      patient has a right to refuse medical treatment. The rights of the state and the 
      patient are not absolute and must be balanced by the judiciary. The result is
      that a mental patient's right to refuse antipsychotic drugs mut be determined on 
      a case by case basis. The authors propose that states pass legislation covering
      the rights of mental patients. A model bill is proposed at the end of the
      article. It establishes a procedural system which addresses the issues of
      informed consent, competency, emergencies, medical review, and judicial review.

TI  - Patient compliance in the mental health continuum of care.
PG  - 75-89
AB  - Noncompliance--not following through on a treatment plan--is explained by the
      traditional acceptance of therapists that many psychiatric patients are not
      motivated for offered therapy. Despite the twenty-year availability,
      methodologies to facilitate a successful continuum of care have not been widely
      implemented. Instead, the patient has been blamed for his lack of motivation. The
      importance of the therapist's behavior, the context, the setting, and the
      environment of the treatment continuum are discussed. Long-standing but
      nontraditional program goals and concepts that facilitate a successful continuum 
      of care are presented.

AB  - More ventilator-dependent children have been discharged to the home over the past
      few years. While some data indicate that home care can be beneficial to both the 
      child and the family, there are risks. Some children can not be home care
      candidates. The psychological consequences of home care on the children and their
      families needs more study. More sophisticated cost accounting is needed to
      analyze the care costs.

TI  - Cost vs. care: American's health care dilemma wrongly considered.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - The state dilemma of American medical care is rapidly increasing costs that
      threaten both quality of care and equal access to care. A frequently cited
      example of what the United States can expect as the crunch between cost and care 
      gets worse is rationing, as used in the British National Health Service. The
      introduction of the British National Health Service, according to this analysis, 
      is inappropriate and clouds the relevant issues. The example of national health
      insurance in Canada--a country much more similar to the United States in size,
      geography, and governmental and social structure--is a much more appropriate
      model to examine. Canada, comparably large, wealthy, and socially heterogeneous, 
      spends approximately 20% less of its GNP on medicine, yet has both universal
      national health insurance and no serious rationing problem. Their example is
      reason to question the stark dilemma of cost vs. care in American medicine.

PG  - 5-28
AB  - Expenditures for home health services provided under Medicare and Medicaid nearly
      tripled between 1977 and 1982. Utilization and expenditures for home health
      services vary widely across the states for both programs, and this article
      examines in some detail the nature and extent of these variations. States vary
      considerably with respect to relative utilization, visits, and visit-expenditures
      under Medicare; and states vary in terms the role visits versus
      visit-reimbursements play in shaping overall costs. The Medicaid program is
      effectively two programs: New York; and the other states, with eight accounting
      for half of Medicaid expenditures outside New York.

TI  - The role of information systems in evaluation research.
PG  - 67-77
AB  - The author suggests four ways that management information systems can complement 
      the efforts of program evaluators. These ways are: clarifying the purposes of and
      uses for collecting information; clarifying the relevancy of information that is 
      collected and stored; constructing a data base that accounts for the differential
      needs of users; and generating reports in a timely and comprehensible manner.
      Interwoven throughout these ways is the premise that program evaluators need to
      attend more to the decisional needs of various users, particularly managers. An
      information system can assist program evaluators toward this end.

AB  - Two models of leadership styles are prominent in the management field: Blake and 
      Mouton's managerial Grid and Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model.
      Much of the research on supervisory styles in social work has been based on the
      former. A recent public debate between the two sets of theorists suggests that
      both have strengths and limitations. Accordingly, an adaptive model of social
      work supervision that combines elements of both theories is proposed.

AB  - This article describes some of the available evidence on the impact of the
      Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for hospitals during its first year, on
      hospitals, other payers for inpatient hospital services, other providers of
      health care, and Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, because the impetus for the
      enactment of the new system stemmed from concern over the financial status of the
      Medicare program, the first-year impact of PPS on Medicare program expenditures
      is also described.

TI  - Functional health measure for adjusting health maintenance organization
      capitation rates.
PG  - 85-95
AB  - Because of increasing interest in at-risk enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries by
      health maintenance organizations, a number of modifications to the adjusted
      average per capita cost (AAPCC) formula employed by the Health Care Financing
      Administration have been proposed recently. Researchers have found that new
      models, which include measures of prior years' utilization and costs, predict
      Medicare payments significantly better than does the purely demographic formula
      currently used. In this article, we show that inclusion of instrumental
      activities of daily living (IADL), a measure of beneficiaries' functional health 
      status, can further improve AAPCC models that already incorporate measures of
      previous-period utilization and costs. Various models for predicting Medicare
      payments were examined and compared using survey data and Medicare claims for a
      random sample of 1,934 beneficiaries. For these models, explained variation in
      subsequent Medicare payments (as indicated by R2 values) increased considerably
      when the IADL variable was included. Although actuarial concerns are associated
      with inclusion of the IADL score in the AAPCC, use of this measure is likely to
      offset other, possibly more serious, actuarial problems associated with including
      measures of previous utilization and costs.

PG  - 75-84
AB  - Cost differences between freestanding and hospital-based skilled nursing
      facilities (SNF's) are identified and examined in this article. Although
      hospital-based and freestanding SNF's have significant differences in terms of
      location, admissions per bed, percent of Medicare days, occupancy rates,
      staffing, provisions of rehabilitative services, and patient characteristics,
      these are insufficient to fully explain cost differences. Less than one-half of
      the existing cost differences can be explained after controlling for case mix,
      staffing, and other cost-contributing factors. A reimbursement system that
      differentiates solely by provider type without relating rates to patient
      characteristics may overcompensate some providers and undercompensate others.

TI  - Changes in distribution of Medicare expenditures among aged enrollees, 1969-82.
PG  - 53-63
AB  - In this article, we examined the concentration of Medicare expenditures among the
      aged for 1969, 1975, and 1982 to determine if expenditures have become more
      concentrated among a few heavy users of service over time. Despite an increase in
      reimbursements for the aged from $6.0 billion in 1969 to $41.8 billion in 1982,
      the distribution of those expenses remained remarkably stable, with a slight
      lessening in the concentration of reimbursements in 1982. Patterns were similar
      for both Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (supplementary medical insurance)
      services. The concentration of expenditures was much greater among survivors than
      among people who died in both 1975 and 1982, with little change in the
      distribution of expenditures within either group.

TI  - Comparison of alternative relative weights for diagnosis-related groups.
PG  - 37-51
AB  - During this study, we investigated the extent to which diagnosis-related group
      (DRG) relative weights based exclusively on charge data differ from DRG weights
      constructed according to the methodology used in deriving the original relative
      weights for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS). The PPS operating cost
      weights were based on a combination of cost and adjusted charge information
      (Pettengill and Vertrees, 1982). The results of this study reveal only minor
      differences between the two sets of weights. Interhospital differences in
      cost-to-charge ratios do not produce large, arbitrary differences between
      charge-based and operating cost weights. Whether the data are standardized for
      differences in capital and medical education costs also appears to make little
      difference.

TI  - Projections of health care spending to 1990.
PG  - 1-36
AB  - National health expenditures are projected to grow to $640 billion by 1990, 11.3 
      percent of the gross national product. Growth in health spending is expected to
      moderate to an 8.7 percent average annual rate from 1984 to 1990, compared with a
      12.6 percent rate from 1978 to 1984. These projections assume lower estimates of 
      overall economic price growth, lower use of hospital care, and increased use of
      less expensive types of care. A preliminary analysis of demographic factors
      reveals that the aging of the population has almost as great an impact as the
      growth in total population on projected expenditures for many types of health
      care services.

TI  - The patient-centered bibliography: uniting library services with the mission of
      the psychiatric hospital.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - The primary function of a hospital is patient care. The development of a
      patient-centered bibliography is suggested as the most effective way of
      organizing information and insuring its use in the psychiatric hospital. The
      patient-centered bibliography is a collection of readings which are especially
      pertinent to the care of an individual patient. It consists of a core of current 
      literature organized around the patient's multiaxial diagnosis (including
      psychosocial stresses), but may also include articles on psychopharmacology,
      special psychotherapeutic techniques, and literature on family dynamics. The
      collection can be expanded to include patient-centered information for two other 
      purposes as well: milieu therapy and patient education.

PG  - 231-46
AB  - In view of the upcoming legislative deadline for inclusion of capital costs
      within the Medicare prospective payment system, both public and private-sector
      entities have scrutinized various capital payment options and debated key issues 
      relating to appropriate overall payments for capital costs, the nature of the
      mechanism for allocating payments to hospitals, and the method for transition
      from the present to the new capital payment system. The new capital payment
      policy will play an important role in future hospital capital decisions and
      technology levels. This report describes the nature and magnitude of hospital
      capital costs, examines alternative proposals for reflecting capital costs in the
      Medicare prospective payment system, and details each alternative's impact,
      incentives, and disincentives.

      can be quickly marshaled to deal with the matter at hand. However, when the dust

      organization over the long term than the original crisis. That is why crisis
      recovery planning should be a part of any strategic planning process.

TI  - How can service businesses survive and prosper?
PG  - 21-32
AB  - Given the competitive spirit of the service sector, the time has come for service
      businesses to recognize that they are really a part of a larger whole, and not
      merely unique, entrepreneurial entities unto themselves. In fact, the author of
      this article warns that if service businesses remain isolated from one another,
      their mortality rate will continue to rise. Through the use of a service matrix, 
      the author shows how service businesses can broaden their professional
      relationships with other services that have similar operations and managerial
      challenges, and in so doing, gain the economic foothold needed to survive and
      prosper.

TI  - Integrating clinical and distributive pharmaceutical services: implications for

PG  - 63-6
AB  - For over two decades, pharmaceutical educators and practitioners have debated
      whether clinical and distributive pharmaceutical services should be integrated or
      segregated, i.e., performed by different persons. The recently defined new
      federal system for reimbursing hospitals for care of Medicaid patients and other 
      beneficiaries according to a prospective reimbursement plan impacts directly on
      this debate. A cross section of the profession has recently reached consensus on 
      the definition of clinical pharmacy at a national invitational workshop. Fiscal
      constraints also impacted on the question in schools which are no longer able to 
      keep expanding their clinical faculties. These factors are related questions
      which academic clinical pharmacy must face are discussed.

AB  - The development and validation of a survey questionnaire measuring pharmacists'
      satisfaction with their jobs and careers is outlined. The instrument was part of 
      a 1983 study which surveyed pharmacists licensed and residing in Florida. The use
      of the pilot survey to arrive at a final survey instrument is outlined.
      Reliability of the instrument is assessed with tests of internal consistency
      reliability. Validity is judged through a test of concurrent validity utilizing
      the Job Descriptive Index, a standardized measure of job satisfaction. The
      delineation of this process is intended to aid other researchers in the
      development and validation of their surveys of job satisfaction and similar
      attitudinal measures.

PG  - 23-7
AB  - This study further examines the externship of participants in the first four
      years of Illinois' mandatory externship program utilizing a mail survey as
      described in an earlier report. This presentation focuses on the accomplishment
      of specific objectives during the externship and assesses their importance in
      current pharmacy practice. The data revealed that, on average, these objectives
      were perceived to have been only slightly to moderately accomplished yet were
      rated between moderate and high importance to current practice. Females rated the
      objective statements pertaining to patient contact and drug monitoring skills
      more favorably than males, but reported lower ratings for both the accomplishment
      and importance of administrative skills when compared to male respondents.
      Several significant differences were found based on externship environment and
      further emphasize the need for multi-environmental experiences in practice based 
      programs.

AB  - This study examines the externship experience of participants in the first four
      years of Illinois' mandatory externship program. A questionnaire was developed
      and mailed to a sample of 300 pharmacists resulting in a 60 percent response
      rate. Analysis of the data suggest a generally positive attitude toward
      externship and this was especially true for more recent graduates. It was also
      found that preceptors were perceived as positive role models, that externship had
      only slightly positive impact on preparing the respondents for practice and their
      perceived development of self confidence, and had virtually no influence on their
      ultimate choice of practice environment. These findings hold important
      implications for future refinements of externship programs.

TI  - PharmD or BS: does the degree really make a difference in pharmacists' job
      satisfaction?
PG  - 1-5
AB  - Secondary analysis of data obtained during the 1982 Socioeconomic Survey of
      California Pharmacists compared practice patterns and job satisfaction of BS and 
      PharmD level practitioners. Questionnaires were mailed to 2,864 pharmacists in
      April 1982. Questionnaires were returned by 1,463 pharmacists yielding a response
      rate of 51 percent. Of those responding, 1,030 were currently practicing with
      either a BS or PharmD as their highest degree. Results indicate that BS level
      practitioners are more likely to be in hospital management or staff positions.
      The percent of time spent educating the public, pharmacy students and other
      health care professionals was the only job activity in which BS and PharmD
      practitioners differed to a statistically significant degree. Time spent
      processing the prescription and management activities had the most influence on
      job satisfaction. Academic degree did not have a statistically significant effect
      upon job satisfaction. These results suggest that when PharmD and BS pharmacists 
      spend an equivalent amount of time doing the same job related activities, PharmD 
      pharmacists are no more dissatisfied with their positions than are BS
      pharmacists.

TI  - Marketing the professional services of the dietitian.
PG  - 92-5
AB  - Professionals are beginning to realize that a good service does not necessarily
      sell itself and that active strategic marketing is often needed. It is no longer 
      sufficient for a dietitian to be up-to-date and provide high quality services;
      cost effectiveness of sound nutrition must be demonstrated and the services of
      the dietitian aggressively marketed. A strategic market plan based on an
      assessment of opportunities and capabilities should be developed and continuously
      adjusted. This article discusses the steps in strategic market planning with
      practical examples for the dietitian. Dietitians should examine the marketing
      strategies being implemented by other professional groups since many can be
      adapted to marketing nutrition services. There exists much opportunity and
      unprecedented challenges for all dietitians, calling for creativity, innovation, 
      and professionalism.

TI  - Physicians and patients: moral agency in a pluralistic world.
PG  - 57-68
AB  - This paper examines the role of the physician in a pluralistic community. A
      personal and communal sense of identity must resolve a vast array of often
      conflicting backgrounds and contexts in order to function smoothly. Physicians
      are neither entitled to impose their own moral views on their patients nor
      expected to surrender their own moral agency. Several illustrative cases are
      given. The solution of inevitable conflicts is embodied within the context of the
      situation, but since irreconcilable differences remain, a resolution is not
      always possible. Tolerance for such differences and ways of dealing with them
      allows the integrity of both parties to remain intact.

OAB - KIE: The problems of medical ethics frequently involve deeply divisive issues
      that reveal different moral systems at work among participants in treatment
      decisions. Loewy discusses the role of physicians in a pluralistic society where 
      they can neither surrender their moral agency--the assumption of responsibility
      for one's actions--to patients nor impose their values on them. He examines six
      scenarios in which conflicts between physicians and patients are rooted in
      differences over the moral issues involved in defining treatment goals and the
      means used to achieve them. Loewy cautions physicians against suppressing their
      moral agency during "working hours" in order to lessen conflict with patients,
      and argues that a dialectic approach to differences can be a learning process
      that "leads to mutual understanding, tolerance, and, at times, agreement."

AB  - This study was designed to survey RMTs in the Southeastern region of the National
      Association for Music Therapy, Inc. concerning their participation and interest
      in research. To accomplish this purpose, a questionnaire was designed and mailed 
      to all RMTs in the Southeastern region (N = 310); completed surveys were returned
      by 141 individuals, for a response rate of 45%. This article discusses survey
      responses in the following four areas: respondents and populations served, nature
      of music therapy programs, research involvement, and research needs and
      interests.

TI  - Predictors of benefit from art, movement, and poetry therapy: a pilot study.
PG  - 87-90
AB  - No validated criteria exist for assigning patients to the creative arts
      therapies. This paper reports on a pilot study attempting to identify predictors 
      of benefit from art, movement, and poetry therapy. Based on a priori hypotheses, 
      selected psychological tests were administered to 31 patients who each received
      all three modalities of treatment. The relationships of these test scores and
      therapist prediction of benefit ratings to outcome were then evaluated
      statistically; outcome was measured by patient ratings and figure drawings.
      Results showed few significant predictors, though several findings requiring
      confirmation may provide a framework for future research. Implications and
      possible explanations of these results, as well as design and other research
      issues relevant to further work in this area, are discussed.

TI  - Prevalence of hepatitis B carriers in a mental health in-patient facility:
      implications for employee screening and vaccination.
PG  - 81-3
AB  - Health care employees in a variety of institutional settings may be exposed to
      Hepatitis B virus through blood contact with patients carrying this infectious
      agent. Employees may be protected from such risk by administration of
      pre-exposure Hepatitis B vaccine or post-exposure immunoglobulin prophylaxis.
      Prior to establishing a Hepatitis B vaccination program for employees, a
      prevalence survey of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity in mental
      health care facility inpatients was conducted to assess employee exposure risk.
      Survey results demonstrated that 15/270 inpatients (5.5 percent) had positive
      HBsAg serologies. These results suggest that positivity may be much higher in
      mental health care facilities than in acute care hospitals. Mental health care
      facilities should routinely survey inpatient populations for the presence of
      HBsAg positivity and consider establishing Hepatitis B serologic screening and
      vaccination programs for personnel involved in delivering care.

TI  - Management audits.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - How can a medical group practice be sure it is working toward its objectives and 
      utilizing its resources to its best advantage? A management audit, when properly 
      conducted and reported, appraises a group's general state of health and
      effectiveness by examining its activities of planning, organizing, supervision,
      control systems, information flow, cost controls, and productivity. By detecting 
      potentially destructive problems and opportunities for improvement, a management 
      evaluation system will help medical group administrators operate effectively in a
      time of rapidly changing conditions.

PG  - 55-64
AB  - A major equipment purchase represents a large outlay of cash and effort by a
      medical group practice. The prudent buyer will carefully negotiate with the
      seller in a number of areas before any final arrangements are made. These include
      a detailed description of what is being purchased; price; warranties and
      guarantees; standards; environmental requirements; technical support and
      training; payment and delivery provisions; acceptance criteria and testing; and
      service and maintenance responsibilities. When all provisions are clearly
      delineated in the acquisition document, there is greater potential for successful
      equipment acquisition and installation.

PG  - 3-17
AB  - Though many medical groups today believe that the benefits of accreditation are
      not worth the costs, will this be true tomorrow? Accreditation is a natural
      extension of the concept of medical group practice itself, and may well be the
      key to the future in terms of demonstrating commitment to quality care, avoiding 
      governmental regulations, obtaining malpractice insurance discounts, insuring
      credibility with reimbursement parties, and distinguishing one's own organization
      from others. Drawing on a recent survey, the author explores current resistance
      to accreditation and expectations for the future.

AB  - Wrongful discharge, sexual harassment, age discrimination--these terms are
      becoming much too familiar to administrators as more and more employee
      termination lawsuits are being brought to today's courtrooms. Making matters even
      more difficult for employers, juries tend to sympathize with the employee. The
      employer's right to discharge an employee has become far from absolute. In this
      sensitive new environment, it is imperative that every employer adopt defensive
      maneuvers to avoid or minimize the risk of liability in employee terminations.

AB  - F.I.L.L.S. is a library-specific software package developed by librarians for
      library staff with little or no computer experience. MacNeal Hospital's Health
      Science Resource Center designed F.I.L.L.S. to allow libraries to save 60 percent
      of the time devoted to the interlibrary loan function while improving service to 
      users. As a management tool, F.I.L.L.S. creates a dozen (12) preprogrammed
      reports that provide invaluable information such as Number of Requests for
      Periodicals, including copyright information; which libraries are borrowed from
      frequently; and which libraries provide the fastest or slowest service in filling
      loan requests. The article describes F.I.L.L.S., its capabilities and its
      limitations in greater detail.

      by the merger of several hospitals. Faced with a tumultuous environment and the
      need for capital, SamCor debated the decision whether they should merge with an
      even larger national investor-owned system. This is a question discussed by
      nearly every hospital in the country. In the following article the SamCor
      decision-making process and outcome are frankly described. Their systematic
      analysis and planning is a model effort.

PG  - 25-34
AB  - In Canada, a health care system has developed that is both responsive to the
      health needs of the Canadian people and has shown financial stability over the
      past decade. The Canadians attribute their success in maintaining stable health
      care costs to regulation of physician fee levels and hospital services. Yet even 
      though there exists regulation in the Canadian health care system, the effect of 
      this government intervention has not resulted in rationing of health care. This
      suggests Americans should examine closely this alternative model of a health care
      system.

TI  - Home health care: the elderly's perception.
PG  - 69-80
AB  - Increasing attention has been given to the identification and description of
      variables associated with health and social services needed, sought and used by
      the elderly. Little is known, however, about the home health care needs of the
      elderly. Moreover, since the inception of the diagnostic related group concept,
      no one has determined the elderly's perception of home health care. The purpose
      of this study is to identify and describe the factors which determine the use of 
      home health care services among the Lucas County, Ohio elderly. Particular
      attention will be given to the role of need, knowledge, and risk factors in the
      use of home care. The methods of analysis are that of descriptive analysis,
      population demand projections, and professional needs estimates. The results
      indicate that a gap exists between the demand for services by the elderly and the
      evaluation of needs by experts. It is recommended that home health care programs 
      must develop support mechanisms that integrate formal and informal networks into 
      a holistic model of health care.

AB  - Ongoing monitoring of frail elders may be an effective way to reduce
      rehospitalization rates. The VNA Risk Reduction Project was a demonstration
      program designed to test this hypothesis. Two hundred and sixty one previously
      hospitalized patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. The nursing
      group received monthly monitoring visits while the telephone group received calls
      by volunteers approximately twice per month. The comparison between the two
      service groups shows that the nursing group visited at least twice had fewer
      hospitalizations and the same length of stay as the telephone group. The findings
      suggest that ongoing monitoring can reduce costs and improve the quality of care.

AB  - Data from the Manitoba Longitudinal Study on Aging is used to describe the
      1975-78 home care utilization of a large probability sample of elderly
      interviewed in 1971. The predictors of home care use of these interviewees are
      identified by multiple logistic regression analysis. Findings indicate that a
      home care program based solely on professionally assessed need admits only a
      small minority of elderly and that, next to age, difficulty in coping with the
      instrumental activities of daily living is one of the best predictors of
      subsequent home care use. Differences between the determinants of home care and
      long-term institutional care are noted and the policy implications of the
      findings are discussed.

TI  - Past and current trends in patient noncompliance research: focus on diseases,
      regimens-programs, and provider-disciplines.
PG  - 21-32
AB  - Patient noncompliance is discussed from an historical perspective with special
      attention given to the fact that although the medical profession was aware of
      noncompliance from the earliest times the first research on noncompliance was not
      done until the 1940's. Trends within the literature on patient noncompliance
      published between 1943 and 1984 are examined. The largest share of contributions 
      being made to the noncompliance literature was and is from journals devoted to
      general medicine and psychiatry. The largest share of research is with patients
      suffering from hypertension, psychiatric patients, and children. An increasing
      amount of attention is being paid to diabetic patients. The bulk of the research 
      on compliance remains patient-focused, with relatively little but much needed
      research designed to study characteristics of providers, regimens, or the health 
      care setting. There are good reasons for compliance researchers to consider
      diabetology as a worthwhile area for investigations.

TI  - Management of journal errata in a health sciences library.
PG  - 41-9
AB  - A management decision to discontinue manually correcting errata in medical
      journals is based on a five-month study and is justified in terms of the cost of 
      identifying and correcting errata, the haphazard way such errors are reported,
      and the fact that online errors are not corrected. Additional questions raised by
      the study address emerging problems with online Full text databases, and with
      whom the responsibility for correcting errors in the medical literature should
      rest. Concern is expressed over the sense of responsibility librarians may feel
      as they provide reference referral to sources of information which may contain
      uncorrected information.

TI  - The legal system, insurance, and health care. What can be done about the
      liability problem? An ECRI technology management assessment.
PG  - 247-68
AB  - Health care providers are currently experiencing a malpractice "crisis" that, in 
      some regions and for some medical specialties, is as serious as the one that
      occurred a decade ago. Whether providers themselves, the insurance industry, or
      lawyers and the legal system are seen as responsible for today's crisis depends
      primarily on the observer. However, evidence indicates that, in health care,
      negligence by those who provide services (physicians and hospital personnel) is a
      more important factor in the health care liability crisis than is so for other
      sectors of society that also face liability-insurance problems (e.g., municipal
      governments, light aircraft manufacturers, ski-slope operators). While physicians
      and hospitals can participate in legislative efforts to achieve tort reform and
      more stringent regulation of liability insurers, this study suggests that they
      will have more success in reducing malpractice insurance premium rates by
      concentrating instead on improving the quality of patient care. Towards this end,
      a number of specific actions are outlined, ranging from greater use of
      patient-care protocols and algorithms to increased activity by state medical
      licensing and disciplinary boards.

TI  - Group excellence: a model for the application of Japanese management to mental
      health centers.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - Mental health centers and other government sponsored service organizations need
      highly effective management techniques. In this era of tightening budgets, the
      Japanese Management System may be a way of increasing both excellence and
      employee satisfaction. Managers who choose to explore this system may need a
      concise, written model as a guide to the ingenious, extensive, and paradoxical
      Japanese Management System. The System centers around quality control
      circles--autonomous problem-solving groups that strive for excellence. Composed
      of hierarchically interlocking groups, it uses a wide selection of group cohesion
      techniques to inspire esprit de corps, and an interlocking set of rewards governs
      behavior at every level. Decision making is collective (although supervisors
      retain veto power), and execution of ideas, once agreed upon, is quick and
      consistent. The System operates holistically, enthusiastically, with a high
      degree of excellence and mutual concern.

AB  - Healthcare managers are debating whether marketing improves their ability to

      can be useful management tools. Managers who understand the marketing process
      will be able to interpret their ability to use marketing to increase market share
      or to obtain greater resources from their governing boards.

TI  - The participative mental health administrator.
PG  - 14-6
AB  - This article analyzes the role of the participative mental health administrator. 
      Participative administrators are distinctive because they are experts in human
      behavior at work, in techniques of professional decision making, and in
      interviewing methods. They also adopt some Japanese management approaches. The
      article concludes with a description of characteristics of participative mental
      health administrators, including the fostering of an open organizational
      environment, giving high standing to individuality, encouraging personal
      development, and favoring decentralized management.

TI  - Initiation of academic health administration education in Israel.
PG  - 217-24
AB  - This article describes the historical and political context of the evolution of
      health care management in Israel, including the role of the Ministry of Health
      and various national advisory committees, and the influence exerted by labor
      unions attempting to control the management work force. Reasons for the lack of
      professional identification among health care managers and the problems faced by 
      universities initiating programs in health administration are examined. The
      author goes on to describe efforts by Ben Gurion University and other
      institutions to implement management education programs for health administration
      and the effects these programs may have on the quality of health administration
      and its status as a profession in Israel.

TI  - Values and CPR decisions: a comparison of physicians and administrators in
      training.
PG  - 205-15
AB  - A report of a study to analyze the effect of sociocultural patient
      characteristics (age, terminal diseases, drug abuse, alcoholism, mental
      retardation, dementia, suicide attempts, institutionalization, noncompliance with
      medical regimens, violent crimes, lack of support system, or relationship to a
      staff physician) on decisions to initiate or withhold cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation in an emergency situation. Pairs of vignettes were presented to
      residents in internal medicine and graduate students in an MBA program for
      comparisons of physicians' decisions with administrators' decisions. On some
      patient characteristics there were significant differences between the two
      groups. For most factors (drug abuse, multiple suicide attempts, age, violent
      crime, lack of known support systems, and relationship to staff), doctors are
      more likely to initiate CPR than are business students representing health care
      administrators. In chronic, long-term situations (carcinoma or heart disease,
      dementia, mental retardation, and institutionalization), the doctors are less
      likely to initiate CPR than the business students. If objectivity is a goal in
      deciding whether or not to initiate CPR, physicians should be aware of
      differences between their opinions and others'.

TI  - Balancing challenge and responsibility: a suggested role for graduate programs in
      addressing career development.
PG  - 187-203
AB  - This article suggests a role graduate programs might adopt to meet the challenge 
      of counseling students to take advantage of new career opportunities, not just
      relying on the allegiances that easily led graduates into traditional careers. It
      proposes a two-stage approach consisting of sets of nurturing activities--to help
      students arrive at well understood, personal professional missions, and
      facilitating activities--to support advancing those professional missions. In
      view of limited academic resources and faculty reward structures that primarily
      acknowledge scholarly productivity, not student service, synergy is essential.
      Its achievement may require marshalling contributions from students, faculty,
      alumni and other practitioners, and professional associations. While requiring
      substantial initial investment of faculty energy, the returns may benefit
      students, faculty, and program alike.

TI  - Methodological issues in the measurement of children's pain.
PG  - 233-41
AB  - This paper focuses on some of the major issues surrounding the measurement of
      children's pain, particularly as they relate to problems of definition, level of 
      measurement, dimensionality, reliability, and validity. The authors briefly
      describe some of the tools used with children and point out some of the problems 
      that have resulted from the lack of well-tested, thoroughly validated instruments
      for children. As a common experience of hospitalized children, pediatric pain is 
      creating concern within the health care community. The authors recommend that
      more attention be paid to the measurement issues surrounding this clinical
      phenomenon.

PG  - 224-32
AB  - Qualitative methodology is an appropriate tool for studying children's health
      care. The present article compares the quantitative and qualitative approaches,
      describes selected qualitative methodologies, and presents a rational for using
      these techniques in children's health research. An example is given of a study
      that combined the two methodologies in order to understand the experiences of
      well children during routine health care.

      tomography scan procedure.
PG  - 211-7
AB  - This device field study investigated children's understanding of the cerebral
      computed tomography scan procedure. Two groups of 10 children each (ages 5-8 and 
      9-11) were interviewed to determine their thoughts and feelings about the
      procedure and the information they would like to have before the procedure. The
      two groups were compared and statistically significant results were found between
      them. The older group evidenced higher levels of conceptual understanding of the 
      procedure. The findings indicate the necessity of taking into account the
      cognitive level of the child when designing and using educational materials.

TI  - Viscosity behaviour and persistence length of sodium xanthan in aqueous sodium
      chloride.
PG  - 307-13
AB  - Zero-shear-rate intrinsic viscosities [eta] of sodium xanthan in aqueous NACl at 
      25 degrees C were determined for five samples ranging in weight- average
      molecular weight from 2 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(6) at salt concentrations Cs between
      0.005 and 1 M, at which the polysaccharide maintains its double-helical
      structure. The measured [eta] for every sample was almost independent of Cs, in
      contrast to usual observations on flexible polyelectrolytes. The persistence
      length q of sodium xanthan was determined as a function of Cs by use of the
      theory of Yamakawa et al. for [eta] of an unperturbed worm-like cylinder, and
      from its Cs dependence the intrinsic persistence length q(o) ( = q at infinite
      ionic strength) was estimated to be 106 nm. This q(o) value was roughly twice as 
      large as that of double-stranded DNA, indicating a high intrinsic rigidity of the
      xanthan double helix. The electrostatic contribution ( = q - q(o)) to q was only 
      about 10% even at the lowest Cs of 0.005 M. Thus, it was concluded that above Cs 
      = 0.005 M, the double- helical structure of sodium xanthan is hardly stiffened by
      electrostatic interactions between charged groups.

TI  - A simple theoretical model of steady-state electrogenic transfer of reactive
      species across membranes. The case of Chara corallina.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Transfer across membranes is treated for simultaneous active pumping and passive 
      flow of the main ionic constituents of plant cells. The chemical equilibrium
      conditions for H2CO3 and H2O dissociation prevailing in the external and internal
      solutions are taken into account. Our model assumes steady-state conditions, zero
      electrical current, electroneutrality inside the membrane and, in both solutions,
      finite space charge densities in two diffuse regions in contact with both sides
      of the membrane. A computer program has been developed for the integration of a
      set of flux equations. The results are displayed in terms of ionic flux
      parameters, each proportional to the ionic pump flow and to the reciprocal of the
      passive ionic mobility. The discussion emphasizes the role of anion inward
      pumping and of non-diffusible anions. The cationic pumps serve to establish
      different ionic balances in the cell. Transmembrane (bulk to bulk) proton pumping
      affects essentially the pH regulation in the cell.

      configurations.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - The reaction between L-arabinose and hydrated Sr(II) or Ba(II) halide salts has
      been studied in H2O solution and adducts of the type M(L-arabinose)X(2).4H(2)O,
      where M = Sr(II) or Ba(II) and X = Cl- or Br- have been isolated and
      characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1H-NMR
      spectroscopy, molar conductivity and X-ray powder diffraction measurements. Due
      to the marked spectral similarities with those of the structurally known
      Ca(L-arabinose)X2 . 4H2O (X= Cl- or Br-) compounds, the Sr(II) and the BA(II)
      ions are eight-coordinated, binding to two l-arabinose molecules via O1, O5 of
      the first and O3, O4 of the second sugar moiety and to four H2O molecules. 1H-NMR
      spectroscopy indicated that the free L-arabinose has the beta-anomer
      configuration in aqueous solution, whereas the alpha-anomer isomer is preferred
      by Mg(II), Ca(II), Sr(II) and Ba(II) ions, on complexation.

TI  - Separation of phosphatidylethanolamine from its oxidation and hydrolysis products
      by high-performance liquid chromatography.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - 1-Palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine degrades relatively quickly when
      subjected to common storage and handling procedures. The degradation products
      consist of compounds in which double bonds in the sn-2 position acyl chain are
      partially oxidized and of products arising from the hydrolysis of the acyl ester 
      bonds. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC), which is widely utilized to isolate and
      to ascertain the purity of phospholipids, does not readily separate the oxidation
      products from the parent lipid class. High-performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC), however, employing a normal phase column and an isocratic, UV-transparent
      solvent system, can be employed to produce a rapid analytical or preparative of
      phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from these degradative impurities.

TI  - Inverted micellar intermediates and the transitions between lamellar, cubic, and 
      inverted hexagonal amphiphile phases. III. Isotropic and inverted cubic state
      formation via intermediates in transitions between L alpha and HII phases.
PG  - 279-301
AB  - Inverted cubic and isotropic phases have been observed in phospholipid and
      glycolipid systems. These phases exhibit characteristic morphologies in
      freeze-fracture electron micrographs, isotropic 31P-NMR resonances and (in some
      cases) cubic X-ray diffraction patterns. It is proposed here that these phases
      may form from the same intermediates that are involved in lamellar/inverted
      hexagonal (L alpha/HII) phase transitions, and that it is possible that these
      cubic and isotropic phases are metastable. According to a kinetic theory of L
      alpha/HII phase transitions, intermediates in such transitions can form
      structures known as interlamellar attachments (ILAs). It is shown that ILAs
      should form in large numbers during L alpha/HII transitions in systems like those
      reported to form inverted cubic or isotropic structures. ILAs cannot readily
      assemble into either the HII phase or well-ordered arrays of L alpha phase
      bilayers, and represent a kinetic trap for intermediates in L alpha/HII
      transitions (although it is possible that they are marginally more stable in a
      thermodynamic sense than the L alpha phase in a small temperature range below
      TH). It is also shown that arrays of ILAs should form metastable arrays with the 
      same morphology and isotropic 31P-NMR resonances that are observed in isotropic
      and inverted cubic states. In particular, under some circumstances ILAs will
      assemble into a structure identical to the bicontinuous inverted cubic phase
      previously described in monoglycerides and very similar in morphology to
      structures observed in phospholipid systems. Finally, since isotropic and cubic
      states form from ILAs, which also can mediate fusion of unilamellar vesicles,
      unilamellar vesicles should fuse to at least some extent under the same
      conditions in which multilamellar samples of the same lipid form isotropic or
      inverted cubic states. This correlation has been observed.

TI  - Interaction of surfactants with vesicle membrane of

      transition of lipid bilayer.
PG  - 261-70
AB  - The gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 
      (DPPC) vesicle membrane was observed in the presence of various types of
      surfactants; sodium alkylsulfates, alkyltrimethylammonium bromides,
      alkanoyl-N-methylglucamides, and hexaethyleneglycol mono n-dodecyl ether. The
      phase transition was monitored by a change in scattered light intensity of the
      lipid suspension. For all the surfactants examined, the phase transition
      temperature was depressed linearly with the surfactant concentration in the
      measured concentration range, from which the partition coefficient, K, of the
      surfactant between bulk solution and lipid membrane was estimated. Except
      alkyltrimethylammonium bromides, log K and log CMC showed a linear relationship, 
      which indicates that the driving force to transfer the surfactant from bulk
      solution to lipid membrane is a hydrophobic interaction. The addition of
      surfactants increased the transition width. The extent of widening the transition
      width was in the order of sodium alkylsulfate greater than alkyltrimethylammonium
      bromides greater than hexaethyleneglycol mono n-dodecyl ether; in the case of
      alkanoyl-N-methylglucamides, the transition width was not affected by the
      addition. These effects on the transition width was interpreted qualitatively in 
      terms of the cooperativity of the transition.

TI  - Phase behavior of synthetic N-acylethanolamine phospholipids.
PG  - 249-60
AB  - Both saturated and unsaturated N-acylethanolamine phospholipids form lamellar
      structures when dispersed in buffer. The addition of excess Ca2+
      (Ca2+/N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine greater than 0.5) results in precipitation. 
      Freeze-fracture replicas indicate that the addition of Ca2+ to the unsaturated
      lipid results in a non-bilayer structure while the Ca2+-complex of the saturated 
      lipid is lamellar. Since unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a
      non-bilayer lipid, its N-acylation with a saturated fatty acid converts a
      non-bilayer lipid into an acidic bilayer lipid capable of interacting with Ca2+
      to return to a non-bilayer structure. Ca2+ may thereby exert an influence on
      membrane phenomena by regulating phase behavior within certain membrane domains. 
      Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates that N-acylation of unsaturated
      PE with a saturated fatty acid also results in changes in thermotropic phase
      behavior. Therefore, N-acylation may affect fluidity within certain membrane
      domains.

TI  - What causes the depolarization of trypsin and trypsinogen fluorescence.
      Intramolecular mobility or non-radiative energy transfer?
PG  - 315-23
AB  - Analysis of protein data bank information about the coordinates of definite atoms
      of protein macromolecules provides an opportunity to evaluate the efficiency of
      non-radiative resonance energy transfer within the model of fixed, strictly
      oriented oscillators. Such evaluations for trypsin and trypsinogen (and also for 
      trypsin complex with a pancreatic inhibitor) show that the efficiency of energy
      transfer among each pair of tryptophan residues is negligibly small. It is also
      shown that a fairly effective energy transfer from tyrosine to tryptophan
      residues is possible. The conclusions have been made that the Tyr-Trp energy
      transfer is one of the factors determining the shape of the trypsin polarization 
      spectrum, and that upon fluorescence excitation at the long-wavelength edge of
      the absorption spectrum, the depolarization of trypsin fluorescence in aqueous
      solution at ambient temperature - compared to model compounds (tryptophan,
      N-acetyltryptophan, glycyltryptophan, etc.), under the conditions of infinite
      viscosity - is due to the Brownian rotational motion of the macromolecules as a
      whole as well as the intramolecular mobility. The differences in the level and
      character of intramolecular mobility of trypsin and trypsinogen are discussed.

TI  - Dynamic light-scattering study on polymerization process of muscle actin.
PG  - 253-69
AB  - Globular actin (G-actin) polymerizes into a fibrous form (F-actin) under
      physiological salt conditions. The polymerization process of muscle actin was
      studied by a dynamic light-scattering method. The intensity correlation functions
      G2(tau) of scattered light from a G-actin solution containing 2 mM Tris-HCl (pH
      8.0) and 0.1 mM ATP were analyzed by a cumulant expansion method, and the
      translational diffusion coefficient was determined to be D = (8.07 +/- 0.10) X
      10(-7) cm2/s at 20 degrees C. This D value gave a diameter of 5.3 nm for
      spherical G-actin including a hydration layer. Polymerization of 1-3 mg/ml
      G-actin in a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mM ATP and 60 mM
      KCl was followed by successive measurements of G2(tau) for a data accumulation
      period of 60-300 s/run. The time evolution of G2(tau) was analyzed by a
      least-squares fitting to the field correlation function of a multiexponential
      form g1(tau) = sigma iAi exp(-gamma i tau) with gamma 1 greater than gamma 2
      greater than 3 greater than ..., and the static scattering intensity I(t) = mean 
      value of I as a function of time t after initiation of polymerization was
      decomposed as I(t) = mean value of I sigma iAi. At the early stage of
      polymerization, a two-exponential fit gave results indicating that component 1
      came from G-actin and component 2 from F-actin growing linearly with t. At the
      middle stage of polymerization, a three-exponential fit gave the results that
      component 1 came from G-actin and possibly its small oligomers, component 2 from 
      polymers with a number-average length Ln of about 900 nm which was independent of
      t, and component 3 from 'ghosts' in dynamic light scattering in a semidilute
      regime. Component 3 was concluded to arise from restricted motions of polymers
      with lengths much longer than Ln in cages formed by polymers giving component 2, 
      and a fragmentation-elongation process of F-actin was suggested to start at the
      middle stage of polymerization, resulting in the size redistribution of F-actin.

AB  - Published results on the stabilization of proteins by sucrose (J.C. Lee and S.N. 
      Timasheff, J. Biol. Chem. 256 (1981) 7193) have been reexamined and interpreted
      in terms of thermodynamic nonideality. The composition dependence of activity
      coefficients may be accounted for on a statistical-mechanical basis using the
      concept of excluded volume. An expression is derived in which the effect of
      sucrose on determination of the partial specific volume of a protein, previously 
      interpreted in terms of preferential protein solvation, is also seen to be
      attributable to excluded volume. Gel chromatographic studies of the reversible
      unfolding of alpha-chymotrypsin are presented which demonstrate temperature- and 
      sucrose-mediated changes in the effective volume of the enzyme. These
      measurements support the quantitative interpretation of the stabilization in
      terms of thermodynamic nonideality arising from the difference between covolumes 
      for sucrose and the two isomeric states of alpha-chymotrypsin. By establishing
      the equivalence of the two approaches that have been used to account for the
      effects of inert solutes on protein transitions, the present investigation
      eliminates the need for any distinction between such solutes on the basis of
      molecular size; and also enhances greatly the potential sensitivity of
      thermodynamic nonideality as a means of probing protein isomerizations, since
      greater displacement of the equilibrium position may be effected by small rather 
      than by macromolecular solutes present at the same weight concentrations.

TI  - Interaction of human low density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B with ternary
      lipid microemulsion. Physical and functional properties.
PG  - 223-41
AB  - Based on data from sedimentation velocity experiments, electrophoresis, electron 
      microscopy, cellular uptake studies, scanning molecular sieve chromatography
      using a quasi-three-dimensional data display and flow performance liquid
      chromatography (FPLC), models for the interaction of human serum low density
      lipoprotein (LDL) and of apolipoprotein B (apo B) with a ternary lipid
      microemulsion (ME) are proposed. The initial step in the interaction of LDL
      (Stokes radius 110 A) with the ternary microemulsion (Stokes radius 270 A)
      appears to be attachment of the LDL to emulsion particles. This attachment is
      followed by a very slow fusion into particles having a radius of approx. 280 A.
      Sonication of this mixture yields large aggregates. Electron micrographs of
      deoxycholate-solubilized apo B indicate an arrangement of apo B resembling
      strings of beads. During incubation, these particles also attach to the ternary
      microemulsion particles and, upon sonication, spherical particles result which
      resemble native LDL particles in size. Scanning chromatography corroborates the
      electron microscopy results. By appropriate choice of display angles in a
      quasi-three-dimensional display of the scanning data (corrected for gel apparent 
      absorbance) taken at equal time intervals during passage of a sample through the 
      column, changes in molecular radius of less than 10 A can be detected visually.
      Such a display gives a quantitative estimate of 101 +/- 2 A for these particles
      (compared to 110 A for native LDL). The LDL-ME particles and apo B-ME particles
      compete efficiently with native LDL for cellular binding and uptake. Cellular
      association studies indicate that both LDL- and apo B-ME particles are effective 
      vehicles for lipid delivery into cells.

TI  - Spectral characterization of ciliary beating. Temperature dependence on spectral 
      parameters.
PG  - 215-22
AB  - Ciliary beating was optically examined in tissue cultures from frog palate
      epithelium. Consecutive segments of the analog signal were Fast-Fourier
      transformed. The three main parameters which define the spectrum, position of the
      peak maximum (f), width of the spectral line (S.D.), and area (A) under the
      spectrum, were all measured as a function of temperature. These measurements were
      also examined as a function of the number of cilia by varying the examined area
      from 1.2 to 122 microns2. It was found that: all the parameters were
      exponentially temperature dependent; and the average frequency was independent of
      the number of cilia examined, while S.D. was dependent on it. On a physiological 
      level, we demonstrated that the ciliary fluctuation in frequency is temperature
      dependent, increasing with increase in temperature. Moreover, it was shown that
      where a relatively small number of cilia were measured (d = 1.24 micron), the
      area A under the observed spectrum was directly proportional to the amplitude of 
      ciliary beating. Increasing the temperature decreases the amplitude and vice
      versa. According to our suggested model the dependence of A on f was predicted
      and verified experimentally. A mathematical model which simulates the S.D. as a
      function of examined area and temperature is suggested. The calculated results
      from the model are in a good agreement with our experimental findings.

TI  - The radiation exposure of black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus) in the Ravenglass
      Estuary, Cumbria, U.K.: a preliminary assessment.
PG  - 273-81
AB  - A variety of fission-product and transuranic radionuclides originating from the
      marine discharges from the fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria are
      detectable in the bodies of black-headed gulls and their environment in the
      Ravenglass Estuary approximately 10 km to the south-west of the plant. The
      maximum concentrations of 95Nb, 137Cs and 239/240Pu detected in body tissues lie 
      in the range 2 X 10(-3) to 1.5 X 10(-2) Bqg-1 wet weight. Many more radionuclides
      are detected in the regurgitated pellets and faeces produced by the gulls and
      have higher concentrations in the range 7 X 10(-3) to 1.7 Bqg-1 wet weight. The
      radionuclide contamination of the sediment produces a source of enhanced external
      gamma-ray exposure which can be measured directly. The available data on
      distributions and concentrations of radionuclides have been combined with simple 
      dosimetry models to provide estimates of the radiation exposure of the birds. The
      total whole body dose rate to the adult birds from the contaminant radionuclides 
      is approximately ten times that from the natural radiation background, while that
      to the developing eggs is approximately four times the natural background. The
      potential radiation exposure of the cells lining the alimentary tract could be
      much higher when contaminated food is in transit, but the long-term average
      exposure in this case is subject to uncertainty. The limited data on the effects 
      of radiation exposure on birds do not indicate any response at dose rates below
      one hundred times that from the natural radiation background.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

PG  - 263-72
AB  - The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) and some physical and chemical
      properties of soil in two counties of Finland have been compared. In the county
      where the MS prevalence rate was significantly higher, the pH of the soil was
      lower, the organic carbon content higher, the concentration of soluble iron,
      zinc, chromium and aluminium higher and those of soluble potassium, calcium,
      magnesium, strontium and total selenium lower than in the county with the lower
      MS-prevalence rate. According to the literature, areas of a high MS prevalence
      correspond rather closely to the global distribution of mires, particularly to
      raised bogs in the northern hemisphere.

TI  - Lead levels in teeth of an urban Indian population.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - The lead content of teeth of Bombay residents has been determined using
      differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. The median tooth lead
      concentrations for adults and children in Bombay are estimated to be 8.31 and
      3.01 micrograms/g of tooth, respectively. The data indicate that the lead
      concentration of a tooth increases with the age of the donor. For children the
      tooth lead content varies with the type of tooth. Further, children living in
      industrial areas have a higher tooth lead content than children living in the
      cleaner suburbs of Greater Bombay.

PG  - 225-9
AB  - Blood-lead levels were determined, each summer during the period 1978-1984, in
      children from Scania in Southern Sweden. A total of 1395 determinations were
      made. The average blood-lead concentration was 55 (range 14-250) micrograms
      1(-1). There was a statistically significant decrease over time, both in rural
      and urban areas, averaging about 4 micrograms 1(-1) per year. Lead exposure has
      thus decreased remarkably. One possible explanation is the contemporary,
      considerable reduction of the alkyl lead content of petrol.

TI  - Towards a scientific basis for regulating lead contamination.
PG  - 209-24
AB  - Dangers from exposure to substances released to the environment, subsequently
      discovered to be hazardous, have been limited as a rule by actions taken
      piecemeal. Recently, more analytical techniques have been devised under the title
      'Risk Analysis' or some similar name in order to produce a more scientific basis 
      for establishing environmental regulations, but the results are often too complex
      to use. Their application to one substance, lead, is made practicable, although
      still leaving a difficult task, by making two assumptions: first, that blood lead
      concentration in humans may be taken to be an indicator both of total exposure
      and of its hazards to human health, and second, that 'threshold' values of blood 
      lead concentration above which some action is necessary can be set and adopted.
      Programmes to control lead usages and pathways in order to reduce exposure in
      value-effective, acceptable and enforceable ways can then be devised and
      implemented, together with monitoring programmes to check the results and
      effectiveness of controls. Adopting these two assumptions offers the advantage
      that should later research show that threshold values have been set too low or
      too high, the rate of applications of all or any of the individual control
      programmes can be modified accordingly. The method is illustrated by using the
      distribution curve of blood lead concentrations now available for the general
      population of Great Britain. This is first used to estimate the numbers above
      each of the agreed threshold values: this procedure establishes the size or the
      importance of the problem. The effects on numbers and the sizes and speeds of the
      responses, of each of the different ways of controlling the different sources and
      pathways, are then assessed qualitatively, and their feasibility, enforceability 
      and costs reviewed. The monitoring programme to check the effectiveness of the
      controls so far imposed is described. By using this procedure, lead contamination
      can be regulated to protect the health of the general population and the results 
      of any or all of the regulations reviewed. One immediate consequence from its
      general application is to demonstrate that separate and specific measures are
      necessary to protect those at highest risk. One immediate advantage is that the
      procedure identifies those decisions that require value judgements.

PG  - 643-50
AB  - Stationary epidermal hyperplasia induced by exposure of mouse skin to 1-6 TPA
      applications was analyzed by electron microscopy and found to be of two types.
      Intermingled orderly and irregularly stratified hyperplastic regions observed
      prominently after a single TPA application gave way, on multiple treatment, to
      epidermal hyperplasia populated by either cuboidal cells with expanded cytoplasm 
      or by highly polar, narrow, tall and pleomorphic cells. Both cell types were
      poorly differentiated and displayed a paucity of intact desmosomal junctions,
      resulting in an incohesive tissue structure in which a number of phenotypic
      variants were expressed. The variants were markedly less mature than the adjacent
      cells and showed basal cell phenotype, acquisition of secretory activity or a
      disturbed mitotic process, resulting in the formation of binucleated cells. The
      observations suggest that the disturbed mitotic process, poor cellular
      differentiation and induction of metaplasia could be the mode by which an
      initiated cell may express its tumor phenotype and escape differentiation during 
      the early stage of TPA promotion.

TI  - Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity cancer: different radiotherapeutic options,
      results and late damages.
PG  - 589-95
AB  - From 1970 to 1983, 69 patients, affected by malignant epithelial tumors of
      paranasal cavities and nasal fossae, were treated with radiotherapy at the
      Radiology Institute of the University and Radiotherapy Hospital Department of
      Florence. Primary carcinoma of the maxillary sinus occurred in 44 patients, of
      the nasal cavity in 20, and of the other sinuses in 5. Most of the patients had
      locally advanced lesions (63 T3-4: 91.5%) according to the adopted TNM system
      (Lederman-Gadeberg, Sisson-Jesse). Crude survival data showed 35% and 13% of NED 
      patients at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Local progression was the most important
      cause of death; patients relapsed within 2 years. The actuarial 5-year survival, 
      corrected for causes of death other than disease, was 32% for the overall series,
      32% for maxillary sinus, and 41% for the nasal cavity. There was no difference in
      survival in patients treated with conventional fractionation (CF) vs. multiple
      daily fractionation (MDF) -30% vs. 33% at 5 years. The late damages of the
      radiation therapy in 22 patients without local disease, with a minimum follow-up 
      of 2 years, is also analyzed.

TI  - Psychologic effects and esthetic results of breast reconstruction after
      mastectomy.
PG  - 585-8
AB  - A survey was conducted on 84 patients who chose to have breast reconstruction
      after mastectomy. A self-rating questionnaire was sent to each patient by mail to
      collect as much information about the patient as possible: individual status,
      reasons for requesting breast reconstruction, acceptance and advantages of having
      the new breast, satisfaction with the overall esthetic results, amount of patient
      information regarding breast reconstruction, and the source of this information. 
      Once the questionnaire was completely filled out, it was returned by mail to the 
      persons conducting this study. Fourty-three patients (51% of sample) replied with
      a completed questionnaire. When all the data for this survey were collected, an
      interesting factor emerged: 33 patients (76.7% of those who replied) reported
      being substantially satisfied with the esthetic results of their operation. When 
      asked about the reasons for requesting breast reconstruction, 16 patients
      asserted their request was based on the desire to prove to themselves that they
      had overcome the disease, and 16 to improve body image. When asked about the
      advantages of breast reconstruction, 17 patients believed the operation would
      help improve inner feelings about the loss of the breast. Thus breast
      reconstruction is indeed an element of prime importance to mastectomized women,
      especially for their physical and psychological rehabilitation.

TI  - New trends in the surgical treatment of primary breast cancer in the Florence
      District: 1979-1985.
PG  - 581-4
AB  - The authors report on a consecutive series of 1979 TIS-T1A-T2A-T3A breast cancer 
      cases surgically treated from 1979 to 1985. The study investigates the impact of 
      recent reports on conservative surgery and of a national treatment protocol for
      breast cancer, encouraging the use of modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and
      quadrantectomy, axillary dissection and breast irradiation (QUART) as
      alternatives to Halsted's radical mastectomy (RM). RM frequency dropped from 52% 
      to 8% in TIS-T1A and from 82% to 20% in T2A-T3A cases in the study period, in
      favor of MRM and of QUART, which increased from 10% to 54% in TIS-T1A cases.
      Although surgical choices differ widely according to individual surgeons, a
      definite trend towards more conservative surgery is evident, which demonstrates
      how the national treatment protocol has affected current surgical practice.

PG  - 565-73
AB  - A series of 10 patients with a primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the central
      nervous system were observed and treated by the authors. All were diagnosed after
      a pathologic examination of the surgical material; the lesions were
      supratentorial in all cases and unifocal in 9. In every case radiation therapy
      improved clinical conditions and in most cases even radiologic features of the
      patients. Four patients were alive and without evidence of disease many months
      after therapy. Four patients died with a relapse in the central nervous system; 3
      of them had disseminated disease at the time of death. Two patients died for an
      unknown cause. Radiation therapy was performed with 60Co source with 2 opposed
      portals and the whole brain irradiation technique in all cases but 2. Doses
      ranged from 35 to 54 Gy. The recent literature on this uncommon disease and the
      most adequate therapeutic possibilities of radiation therapy and chemotherapy, or
      both, are discussed.

TI  - Prognostic value of "total tumor mass score" (TTM): a retrospective analysis of
      130 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 559-64
AB  - The validity of the clinical staging of Jaksic and Vitale for chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL), designated total tumor mass score (TTM), was tested in 130
      consecutive and previously untreated patients followed at our institution over a 
      15-year period. The analysis, extended to the whole population, confirmed the
      prognostic value of the TTM score. Patients with a high TTM (greater than 9.0)
      had an expected median survival (EMS) of 30 months; those with a low TTM (less
      than 8.9) had an EMS of 129 months (P less than 0.001). The prognostic value of
      TTM remained even after adjustment was made for age, sex, lymphocyte count, TTM
      distribution pattern, bone marrow failure, and response to therapy. Taking into
      account the value of the TTM score, patients of the intermediate risk group
      (stage II of Rai et al.) could be divided into two subgroups with a different
      prognosis (EMS 200 vs. 32 months; P less than 0.005). When used as a continuous
      quantitative parameter the TTM score may help to define response to therapy. In
      this study TTM response to therapy was significant for prognosis (P less than
      0.001), and there seems to be relationship between the degree of response and
      survival probability.

TI  - Opportunities for improving the cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - Hypertension is an extremely important public health problem, both medically and 
      economically. The cost burden of treatment may significantly compromise care for 
      the individual patient, while in aggregate the direct costs of antihypertensive
      treatment in the United States approach $8 billion a year. Improved insurance
      coverage and efforts to control the costs of antihypertensive treatment are
      needed. Efforts to reduce the costs of care, with minimal or no reduction in its 
      quality, should focus on the following: limiting treatment to patients with
      sustained diastolic hypertension; improving the efficiency of the delivery
      process; and emphasizing "low-cost prescribing strategies." The uncertainty that 
      remains over the risk-benefit ratio of pharmacologic treatment for patients with 
      very mild hypertension (90 to 94 mm Hg diastolic) raises additional questions.
      Even if treatment of mild hypertension is effective, it is without doubt less
      cost-effective than treatment of moderate and severe hypertension. Is this cost
      worthwhile? Such trade-offs of cost and benefits will increasingly have to be
      confronted in the face of limited health care resources.

TI  - Stepped care and profiled care in the treatment of hypertension: considerations
      for black Americans.
PG  - 39-44
AB  - The stepped-care approach to the treatment of hypertension has proved to be
      effective in helping control hypertension and in reducing morbidity and mortality
      associated with hypertension and related cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless,
      modifications to the stepped-care approach can provide more effective care for
      certain patient subgroups. By applying the best principles of stepped care to a
      more individualized methodology, a "profiled-care" approach to treating
      hypertension has been made available. Profiled care may prove particularly
      valuable in treating hypertensive patients in black urban communities where all
      forms of hypertension are disproportionally represented because of various
      physical, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors. Along with efforts by the
      government and private sectors to eliminate barriers to effective hypertension
      control in poor black communities, profiled care can help achieve control equal
      to that achieved in more affluent communities.

TI  - The changing health care environment.
PG  - 3-8
AB  - In 1985, the rate of growth of national health expenditures was more than twice
      the overall rate of growth in prices in the United States, while the percentage
      of health expenditures relative to the Gross National Product reached a record
      high of 10.7 percent. There have been almost no changes in the fraction of direct
      patient payments for medical care since 1980, or in the fraction paid by third
      parties or the government. Consequently, cost increases in the gross price of
      medical care are being transferred directly to the patient population. The
      expense associated with medical treatment and the availability of managed care
      systems (Health Maintenance Organizations and Preferred Provider Organizations,
      among others) have contributed to the increasing cost consciousness of patient
      and physician alike. One of the areas in which the spiralling costs of medical
      care are most deeply felt is in the treatment of hypertension. The direct costs
      for treating this condition, which affects more than 25 percent of the American
      population, exceed $8 billion annually. Furthermore, hypertension is a chronic
      condition in which the cost of treatment is continuously apparent to the patient.
      Moderate and severe hypertension is more likely to affect elderly and black
      patients, the people who are least able to pay for therapy. Difficulty in paying 
      for therapy is becoming an increasingly important problem due to the trend among 
      physicians to prescribe newer and more expensive antihypertensive drugs instead
      of the more commonly used diuretics and beta blockers. Due to the cost-conscious 
      attitude of patients, the physician who chooses the more expensive drugs may run 
      the risk of losing patronage among middle- and upper-income patients. In the case
      of lower-income patients, prescribing expensive drugs may result in
      noncompliance. In order to guard against incursions by managed care systems and
      ensure the best care for low-income patients, physicians must assume a
      cost-conscious attitude toward the treatment of hypertension.

PG  - 610-3
AB  - From a synopsis of the large number of epidemiological studies of the recent 20
      years it is know, that inhalation of cigarette smoke is the most important factor
      that generates chronic bronchitis. Other noxious agents about which there are
      still controversial opinions, are air pollution and occupational inhalants.
      Although hypersecretion of mucus is the primary symptom of chronic bronchitis, it
      seems to have no particular prognostic meaning. Whether severe airflow
      obstruction develops, apparently depends upon predisposing factors such as
      disturbances of humoral immunity manifested by marked hypogammaglobulinemia or a 
      defect of mucociliary clearance. In recent time increased serum IgE-levels in
      mom-atopic smokers with bronchial obstructions were reported. Frequent recurrent 
      bronchial infections alone seem to be no serious risk factor. The molecular
      mechanisms that lead to structural damage are clarified. Activated alveolar
      macrophages attract polymorphonuclear leucocytes by chemotaxis. These cells set
      free proteolytic enzymes such as elastases. In addition certain oxidants inhibit 
      the protection system of proteinase inhibitors.

PG  - 617-20
AB  - Bronchitis in definition contains increased sputum production and cough. They
      gain importance through smoking and air-pollution. Both influences are good
      recordable. The last one is demonstrated by a regional air-monitor-net.
      Connections between air-pollution and airway diseases are seen in
      course-monitoring after pollution reducing actions. Essential complication of
      bronchitis as an airway disease in obstruction, airflow limitation. In small
      airways it runs at least synchronously. This obstruction is more sure and
      objective measureable than subjective complainted cough. This data, especially
      those of the flow-volume-loop, should have more weight. They correlate
      statistically significant in own studies in town-to-country differences to
      pollution, not to the only symptom of cough. Peak-Exspiratory-Flow and
      spirography show in comparison only a trend. The flow-rates might demonstrate
      more surely and objectively the environment-infrastructure in function data as
      possible cause for bronchitic airway diseases.

TI  - [Pathophysiology of chronic bronchitis].
PG  - 614-6
AB  - In patients with airflow obstruction "chronic bronchitis" should be
      differentiated from emphysema. We are dealing with 2 clinical types: type A,
      "pink puffer" ( = emphysematous type), and type B, "blue blooter" ( = bronchitic 
      type). Patients with chronic airflow obstruction have very seldom pure
      bronchitis, mostly both diseases are present at the same time and one dominates
      the other. It is questionable, if chronic bronchitis is an entity of its own
      rather than a symptom. It is suggested the term "chronic mucous hypersecretion", 
      be used, rather than "chronic bronchitis", and that the latter be avoided. From a
      pathophysiological point of view "chronic bronchitis" should not be used
      synonymous with "chronic airflow obstruction" (CAO) or "chronic airflow
      limitation" (CAL).

AB  - Forskolin, a potent adenylate cyclase activating diterpene-derivative, isolated
      from the Indian plant Coleus forskohlii, was tested double-blind and cross-over
      in 12 healthy volunteers (nonsmokers) by whole body plethysmography. All drugs
      were administered by metered dose inhalers. The bronchodilating effect (after 5
      minutes) was as good as following fenoterol. At the beginning (after 3 and 5
      minutes) the protective effect against inhaled acetylcholine was as good as
      following fenoterol while later on (after 15 and 30 minutes) fenoterol resulted
      in a stronger action.

TI  - Mutagenicity assay of emission extracts from wood stoves: comparison with other
      emission parameters.
PG  - 199-208
AB  - The emission from wood stoves of several types of air pollutants has been
      measured under standardized burning conditions with emphasis on the amount of
      organic compounds and determination of the mutagenic activity with the
      Salmonella/microsome assay. The study corroborates earlier findings that
      conventional wood stoves can be a significant source of hydrocarbon and tar
      compounds in the ambient air. The emission of mutagenic compounds comprise both
      compounds requiring mammalian activation and compounds which are active in the
      test without exogenous activation. The mutagenicity tests show that nitroaromatic
      compounds are present in wood stove emissions, although the emission of nitrogen 
      oxides is low. A wood stove constructed using the downdraft principle emitted
      much less hydrocarbons and tar, less mutagenic components and slightly less
      carbon monoxide than conventional wood stoves.

TI  - Antitumoral activity of the oxazaphosphorine derivative,
      mafosfamide-cyclohexylamine salt (ASTA 7557) on a murine ovarian reticular cell
      sarcoma and its subline resistant to cyclophosphamide.
PG  - 637-42
AB  - The antitumor activity of mafosfamide (MFA), and its parent compound
      cyclophosphamide (CTX), was investigated against an ovarian reticular cell
      sarcoma growing i.m. in C57BI/6 mice (M5), which is very sensitive to CTX, and
      against a subline of this tumor (R16) resistant to CTX. MFA is the prototype of a
      class of oxazaphosphorines which do not require metabolic activation since under 
      physiologic conditions they undergo rapid spontaneous hydrolyzation to the
      activated 4-hydroxyoxazaphosphorine and retain a spectrum of activity very
      similar to the parent compound. After a single dose (300 mg/kg X 1) or repeated
      low doses (100 mg/kg X 6) the antitumoral activity of MFA on the M5 tumor
      appeared comparable to or only slightly lower than CTX; the highest T/C value for
      median survival times was 167% in MFA-treated mice vs. 176% in the CTX group. MFA
      showed no activity against the R16 subline, thus indicating cross-resistance
      between the two drugs. Marked thickening of the glissonian capsule with
      compression of the lobular area of the liver, observed on i.p. administration of 
      MFA, did not result in histopathologic abnormalities of the hepatic parenchyma.
      The therapeutic efficacy of MFA was similar with i.p. and the i.v. route. MFA may
      represent a good candidate to replace CTX in cases in which a compound acting per
      se, and not through metabolites, is preferred.

TI  - Cancer of the pancreas: clinical outcome in 76 cases.
PG  - 601-7
AB  - A final diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was established in 76 consecutive patients
      during 4 years. The clinical outcome was evaluated retrospectively, as well as
      clinical presentation and its impact on the rate of resectability. Even though
      the diagnostic techniques showed a high sensitivity, only 18.4% of patients had a
      radical resection performed. In 77.6% of the cases a tissue diagnosis had been
      obtained. However, in only 1/5 of them was the tissue proof obtained
      preoperatively. This review confirms that the survival of patients with
      pancreatic cancer is poor, with slight advantages in the few resectable cases.
      Therefore, an earlier diagnosis should be attempted in high-risk symptomatic
      patients, selected by means of nonaggressive tests and evaluated by means of more
      accurate diagnostic techniques, when suitable.

TI  - Serial transplantation of a human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia into nude mice.
PG  - 553-8
AB  - A human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia line (PF-382) was serially transplanted
      into nude mice. No takes were observed in untreated nude mice, whereas solid
      tumors were observed in splenectomized and total body, sublethally irradiated
      mice. The minimal tumor-inducing dose and the latency time remained unchanged
      after the third and fifth serial transplants. Moreover, leukemic cells recovered 
      from the 8th in vivo passages displayed the same differentiation antigens and
      chromosomal markers as the in vitro PF-382 cell line used for the first
      transplant. This stable and well-characterized experimental system could be a new
      model for T-lymphocyte differentiation and immune-reactivity against human
      leukemias.

TI  - The value of immunohistological techniques in undifferentiated cancers.
PG  - 539-44
AB  - From 1980 to 1984, we observed 144 undifferentiated cancers, of which 116 (0.9%
      of all cancers treated during this period) were treated in our center.
      Immunohistochemical study classified 130 tumors (90%), which comprised 82
      non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (57%), 32 carcinomas (22%), 7 melanomas (5%), 7 sarcomas 
      (5%) and 2 others (1%). Sixty-nine patients, with the diagnostic problem of
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma versus carcinoma, which was solved by immunohistology,
      were followed up for 44 +/- 20 months. Lymphomas (57 cases) had a better clinical
      course than carcinomas (11 cases), and a clinical course similar to high-grade
      lymphomas identified by conventional histology. For 66 patients with the same
      problem, the treatment was started before the immunohistochemical diagnosis. This
      treatment was inappropriate in the light of the correct diagnosis in 16 of 66
      cases (24% of all cases).

TI  - Treating hypertension. A review of clinical trials.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - Extensive clinical trials have been carried out to test the effectiveness of
      antihypertensive therapy in controlling high blood pressure and in reducing the
      morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension and related cardiovascular
      and cerebrovascular disease. These trials have studied more than 40,000
      individuals in programs worldwide. Although they answered many important
      questions, some of these trials have failed to produce conclusive results
      concerning certain issues, such as the results of treatment on coronary artery
      disease. The medical community has come to rely on clinical trials in evaluating 
      the treatment of many different chronic diseases, and this methodology has become
      the accepted means of evaluating therapy. Analyses of the clinical trials on
      hypertension and their implications should review factors other than fatal and
      non-fatal end points if their results are to be useful for the practicing
      physician in making treatment decisions.

      are difficult to perform. Vague definitions and inhomogeneous examination

      Chronic bronchitis occurs more often in males. The significance increases with
      advancing age. Smoking habits are of utmost importance. Indoor and outdoor air
      pollution is without doubt a significant agent in the etiology of chronic
      respiratory disease.

OAB - PIP: Many Authors agree about a relationship between higher estroprogestinic
      levels and periodontal inflammation. This study tries to define the relationship 
      between oral contraceptives (OC) and specific gingival signs, like bleeding and
      plaque. 51 women (15 to 19 years) were studied while using OC, and 36 of the same
      age group were studied as controls. Only women who had no past medical history of
      hormone imbalance, diabetes mellitus or dentures were selected. The patients were
      examined at the beginning of the study and were assigned scores related to the
      amount of plaque, inflammation and pockets (Loe and Silness gingival index). Use 
      of alcoholic beverages, medications, tobacco, and caffeine were also noted. The
      only significant difference between the control group and the women taking OC was
      cigarette smoking: 52.9% versus 41.6% respectively. The average time of treatment
      was 11.5+5 months. No changes were observed in the buccal and lingual mucosa in
      both populations. The plaque indexes were very close. The bleeding was
      significantly higher in the group using OC; same for the gingival index. Pockets 
      deeper than 2 mm were present in 33.3% of the treated women, versus 13.8% of the 
      controls. The results point out a significant direct relationship between OC and 
      gingival inflammation after several months of use. It possible that by prolonging
      the length of the study the gingival lesions would become even more significant.

      CEA.
PG  - 621-4
AB  - Two hundred and twenty-one hospitalized patients underwent serum determination of
      CA 19-9, a recently developed tumor marker assay, and CEA. Among these, 53 had a 
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, 59 a GI benign disease, 52 a non-GI cancer, and 57 
      a non-GI benign disease. CA 19-9 assay was more accurate than CEA to detect
      malignancy, especially of GI source (69.8% sensitivity vs. 24.5% in GI patients);
      when a cutoff level of 41 ng/ml for CA 19-9 was considered, only 6 false-positive
      cases were found and both markers showed excellent specificity (94.9% for CEA and
      89.9% for CA 19-9 in gastric, hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer). We conclude
      that CA 19-9 is a useful GI tumor marker and it seems to be better than CEA in
      some pathologic situations.

PG  - 545-51
AB  - We use murine erythroid Friend cells and human promyelocytic HL60 cells to
      investigate the influence of a transmembrane signal in triggering myeloid or
      erythroid cell differentiation. Combined treatments were given with
      dimethylsulfoxide, actinomycin D and amphotericin B, a substance which resembles 
      a deviant membrane lipid and which seems to influence exclusively membrane
      activity. Our results suggest that a membrane modification alone is sufficient
      for in vitro HL60 cell differentiation, whereas both a transmembrane and a
      nuclear signal are necessary for Friend cell differentiation.

TI  - [Antibacterial therapy of acute exacerbated chronic bronchitis].
PG  - 633-7
AB  - An early therapy of the acute exacerbation is important for the long-term
      prognosis of chronic bronchitis. The aim of the therapy is to stop the
      progressive damage of the bronchial mucosa. The typical clinical symptoms and the
      knowledge of the usual pathogens (in at least 80% hemophilus influenzae and
      streptococcus pneumoniae) allow a "blind" chemotherapy with aminopenicillins,
      tetracyclines and the trimethoprim-sulphonamide combination as medication of
      choice. The treatment is successful when the purulent sputum turns mucoid within 
      2 to 5 days and the symptoms improve. If this does not happen, culture and
      antibiogram should be made and chemotherapy chosen according to the findings. The
      acute exacerbation can be complicated by an airway obstruction. In this case the 
      short-term application of glucocorticoids in combination with bronchodilators and
      secretolytics is suggested.

TI  - Viscosity dependence of the solute quenching of the tryptophanyl fluorescence of 
      proteins.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - We have studied the viscosity dependence of the acrylamide quenching of the
      fluorescence on the internal tryptophan residues in cod parvalbumin and
      ribonuclease T1, as well as the model systems. N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide and
      glucagon. For the latter systems, the apparent rate constant, kq(app), for
      acrylamide quenching shows a typical diffusion-limited behavior. For parvalbumin 
      and ribonuclease T1, however, the viscosity dependence of kq(app) is quite
      different. There is little change in the kq(app) values on increasing the bulk
      viscosity from 1 to 10 cP (by addition of glycerol), but a further increase from 
      10 to 100 cP results in a significant reduction in the kq(app). Both an unfolding
      mechanism and a quencher penetration mechanism are considered to explain the
      results. Only the penetration mechanism is found to be consistent, and our data
      are interpreted as indicating that the rate-limiting step for quenching goes from
      being that of diffusion through the protein matrix, at low viscosity, to
      diffusion through the bulk solvent, at high viscosity. By also considering the
      Kramers' relationship in fitting our data, we are able to obtain insight
      regarding the coupling between internal fluctuations in the structure of the
      protein and motion of the bulk solvent. For parvalbumin and ribonuclease T1, the 
      internal dynamics are found to be very weakly coupled to the bulk.

      unit.
PG  - 625-8
AB  - Between 1962 and 1983 a total of 26 patients with malignant trophoblastic disease
      were diagnosed in northern Finland. The incidence of this disease was 1:21,000
      pregnancies. Eight patients had choriocarcinoma and 18 an invasive mole.
      Clinically, 15 patients belonged to the nonmetastatic and 11 to the metastatic
      group. Of the latter, 4 patients belonged to the low-and 7 to the high-risk
      categories. During the first years of the study period, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
      mostly single-drug therapy, was often complemented with adjunctive surgery and/or
      irradiation. During recent years, single- or multidrug chemotherapy was
      supplemented with surgery in only one case with chemotherapy-resistant pulmonary 
      metastases. All 26 patients are alive and disease-free, and after therapy 6 of
      them have given birth to 1-3 children. Our results suggest that malignant
      trophoblastic diseases can be successfully treated also in small centers of
      gynecologic oncology with up-to-date knowledge of the principles of modern
      cytotoxic chemotherapy.

AB  - Twelve adults with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 8 individuals with
      histologically normal liver, were measured for serum selenium concentration and
      glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) of liver tissue. It was found a reduced serum
      selenium and liver GSH-Px in patients with HCC. Serum selenium concentration and 
      the enzyme activity were positively correlated (p less than 0.01). The increased 
      risk of carcinoma in selenium deficiency may be partially due to a reduced
      activity of GSH-Px, one of the most important scavenger enzymes of oxygen toxic
      radicals.

      intercellular duct-like vacuoles with numerous microvilli containing a
      microfilament core that terminated in a terminal web, which represents an unusual
      aspect in the spectrum of differentiation of fibrolamellar hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

PG  - 283-6
AB  - Continuing our investigation of the relationships between internal motions and
      functional properties of soluble and membrane-bound proteins we have explored the
      lifetimes and correlation times associated with the fluorescence emission of
      fluorescein-labeled Ca2+-dependent ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The emission
      was characterized by two lifetime components near 1.8 and 4.1 ns, probably due to
      exposure of the probe to environments of different polarities. The time-dependent
      anisotropy showed the presence of two correlation times near 0.8 and 6.6 ns. The 
      shorter correlation time was due to motions of the probe around its point of
      attachment on the surface of the protein. The longer correlation time indicated
      the presence of internal motions of the protein. Both lifetimes and correlation
      times were insensitive to temperature between 2 and 10 degrees C. They were also 
      insensitive to addition and removal of 100 microM free Ca2+.

AB  - Cells with argyrophil granules were searched for in 131 consecutive specimens
      obtained from endometrial curettage. Particular care was taken with the fixation 
      methods to avoid a false positivity to the silver impregnation according to
      Grimelius. We did not consider the grossly argyrophilic positivity on the
      cellular apex or of the whole cytoplasm, which was partially reduced by diastase 
      digestion and probably due to the presence of glycogen and secretory
      mucoproteins. Cells with thin argyrophilic granules similar to those observed in 
      endocrine APUD cells were present among glandular cells and/or among stromal
      cells in 15 of 131 examined specimens. They concerned 5 cases of proliferative
      endometrium, 3 of secretive endometrium, 5 of hyperplasia, and 2 of carcinoma. In
      8 of the 15 cases with argyrophilic cells, immunohistochemical studies with the
      PAP method showed cells with the presence of FSH, S-100 protein, somatostatin,
      vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). 
      The significance and origin of these cells in normal and neoplastic endometrium
      are discussed.

TI  - Therapeutic choice in the treatment of hypertension. Initial treatment of newly
      diagnosed hypertension and secular trends in the prescribing of antihypertensive 
      medications for Medicaid patients.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - A "stepped-care" approach has been widely recommended for more than 10 years as
      an empiric method for the treatment of hypertension. This approach encourages the
      use of diuretics or beta blockers as initial monotherapy for hypertension.
      Although these and other antihypertensive regimens tested in clinical trials have
      substantially reduced morbidity and mortality from cerebrovascular disease, their
      relative effectiveness in reducing the sequelae of coronary artery disease is not
      as well established. These findings, coupled with the development of new drug
      regimens, have led to a re-examination of the stepped-care guidelines. This
      re-examination will stimulate increased interest in the therapeutic choices made 
      by practicing physicians, particularly because the newer drugs are more costly
      than the traditional treatments. To address this question, we performed two
      specific studies, using data bases from Michigan and Tennessee Medicaid programs.
      The first study analyzed prescriptions for newly diagnosed cases of essential
      hypertension. The second study analyzed secular trends in the prescribing of
      antihypertensive regimens since that time. The data suggest that in 1982 and 1983
      (the time period under consideration in the first part of the study), physicians 
      treating hypertension for Medicaid enrollees followed the stepped-care
      recommendations, the majority using diuretics as step-one monotherapy. The
      secular trend data in the second study showed a moderate decrease in the use of
      diuretics since 1983. There were marked increases in the use of newer
      antihypertensive medications such as calcium channel blockers and the angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Because the costs of the newer drugs are
      substantially higher, a shift to these drugs would significantly increase the
      cost of treating hypertension in this country. Prospective, controlled trials are
      necessary to ascertain if the increased costs of the newly developed drugs are
      justified by potential benefits.

TI  - Essential hypertension: cost-effective evaluation and treatment.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - The widespread prevalence of hypertension in the United States and the enormous
      expense and effort associated with its treatment necessitate a cost-conscious
      approach to evaluation and therapy. In the past, we have devoted too many
      resources to testing for rare diseases suspected of causing hypertension when it 
      has been demonstrated that secondary causes are rare. Devoting resources to the
      effective treatment of essential hypertension itself should be a priority,
      because such treatment has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality
      associated with hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. Clinical and
      epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that treatment for hypertension should
      not be initiated unless diastolic blood pressure readings are 90 mm Hg or greater
      on three successive office visits. Treatment should be carried out in a step-wise
      fashion, using a non-pharmacologic approach only in situations in which
      hypertension is mild, target organ disease is absent, and compliance is
      favorable. Diuretics should be used as step-one drug therapy in most situations, 
      because they are effective in the majority of patients, convenient to use, easy
      to titrate, and comparatively inexpensive. They do not cause salt and water
      retention, and side effects are usually minimal. When the use of diuretics is
      contraindicated, beta blockers are suitable alternatives, equally effective in
      most respects. When beta blockers or other non-diuretic drugs are used as
      step-one therapy and an additional drug is needed, diuretics can be used
      advantageously in conjunction with the step-one drug.

      therapy.
PG  - 20-4
AB  - In the summer of 1986, the Gallup Organization conducted two surveys, one of the 
      physicians who treat hypertension and the other of patients who were receiving
      medications for hypertension. Objectives were to assess current patterns of
      treatment and the impact of cost on treatment for hypertension. Seventy percent
      of the patients report being prescribed medication immediately following the
      diagnosis of hypertension. Diuretics are the most frequently prescribed initial
      medication (76 percent of physicians), followed by beta blockers (44 percent of
      physicians). Physicians report recent trends, however, towards more use of beta
      blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and less use of diuretics. 
      Only 59 percent of patients have insurance that covers medication, and about one 
      in four patients report that paying for medications or physicians' fees is "very 
      much" or "somewhat" of a problem. The costs of care are of concern to physicians 
      as well as to patients.

PG  - 297-305
AB  - A kinetic and thermodynamic study has been carried out to characterize
      quantitatively the conformational equilibrium of gramicidin A (GA) in
      tetrahydrofuran at different peptide concentrations in the absence and presence
      of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine by using size-exclusion high-performance liquid
      chromatographic analysis. In the absence of lipid, the experimental data fit a
      simple dimer-monomer equilibrium, the rate and equilibrium constants for the
      dissociation process being (1.6 +/- 0.7) X 10(-7) s-1 and (8.5 +/- 0.3) X 10(-6) 
      M, respectively. A higher extent of monomerization and a decrease in the time
      required for reaching equilibrium are detected in the presence of phospholipid,
      the kinetic and thermodynamic effects depending on both lipid and GA
      concentrations. In order to account for these observations a cyclic equilibrium
      mechanism is proposed which is analysed in terms of four conformational species, 
      namely, free monomer, free dimer, lipid-bound monomer and lipid-bound dimer. The 
      results obtained are discussed in relation to recent literature data on
      lipid-protein interactions.

TI  - Structure of a stable form of sulfheme.
PG  - 8458-66
AB  - A stable green heme was extracted from ferric cyanosulfmyoglobin after it had
      undergone an internal conversion reaction. After iron removal and conversion to
      the methyl ester, the resulting green porphyrin was purified by high-pressure
      liquid chromatography. Visible, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometric studies provided
      evidence to identify the substituents of the porphyrin. Nuclear Overhauser
      enhancements enabled an assignment of the single modified pyrrole. Substituent
      positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have the original protoporphyrin IX substituents. 
      At ring B, the 4-vinyl group has cyclized with a single sulfur atom to form a
      fifth ring with a 2,5-dihydrothiophene type of structure.

TI  - ATP-induced dissociation of rabbit skeletal actomyosin subfragment 1.
      Characterization of an isomerization of the ternary acto-S1-ATP complex.
PG  - 8454-8
AB  - The adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) induced dissociation of
      actomyosin subfragment 1 (S1) has been investigated by monitoring the light
      scattering changes that occur on dissociation. We have shown that ATP gamma S
      dissociates acto-S1 by a mechanism similar to that of ATP but at a rate 10 times 
      slower. The maximum rate of dissociation is limited by an isomerization of the
      ternary actin-S1-nucleotide complex, which has a rate of 500 s-1 for ATP gamma S 
      and an estimated rate of 5000 s-1 for ATP (20 degrees C, 0.1 M KCl, pH 7.0). The 
      activation energy for the isomerization is the same for ATP and ATP gamma S, and 
      both show a break in the Arrhenius plot at 5 degrees C. The reaction between
      acto-S1 and ATP was also followed by the fluorescence of a pyrene group
      covalently attached to Cys-374. We show that the fluorescence of the pyrene group
      reports the isomerization step and not actin dissociation. The characterization
      of this isomerization is discussed in relation to force-generating models of the 
      actomyosin cross-bridge cycle.

TI  - Evidence that heme d1 is a 1,3-porphyrindione.
PG  - 8447-53
AB  - Heme d1 is the noncovalently associated heme prosthetic group of the bacterial
      nitrite reductase known as cytochrome cd1. Additional evidence has been obtained 
      in support of a dioxoisobacteriochlorin, or 1,3-porphyrindione, skeleton for this
      heme. The new data include the natural abundance 13C NMR spectrum of the free
      base methyl ester derivative of d1, mass spectrometric determinations of the
      molecular mass of the free base methyl ester and the Cu and the Zn chelates,
      visible and 1H NMR spectral comparisons between d1 and synthetic porphyrindione
      model compounds, and the isolation and characterization of several byproducts
      formed during the purification of the free base methyl ester of d1. The
      accumulated evidence strongly supports the following structure for the skeleton
      of d1: 1-oxo-2-methyl-2'-acetyl-3-oxo-4-methyl-4'-acetyl-5-methyl-6-acrylyl+
      ++-7- propionyl-8-methylporphyrin.

TI  - Inhibition of the thermally driven B to Z transition by intercalating drugs.
PG  - 8436-9
AB  - Poly(dG-m5dC) in phosphate buffer containing 50 mM NaCl and Mg2+ will undergo a
      reversible thermally driven conversion from the B to the left-handed Z
      conformation. The temperature at the midpoint of the thermally driven B to Z
      transition (denoted Tz) is dependent upon the total Mg2+ concentration, with
      [d(1/Tz)]/(d ln [Mg]) = 0.0134 K-1. The Mg2+ concentration at the midpoint of the
      equilibrium B to Z transition curve, denoted [Mg]1/2, is dependent on
      temperature, with (d ln [Mg]1/2)/(d ln T) = -1.02. Binding of the anticancer drug
      daunomycin to the polymer results in a pronounced increase in Tz, dependent on
      the molar ratio of added drug. Tz is increased by 71.9 degrees C with nearly
      saturating amounts of drug bound. Transition profiles are biphasic at less than
      saturating amounts of bound drug. By experiments monitoring such biphasic curves 
      at a visible wavelength sensitive to the binding of daunomycin, it may be
      demonstrated that no drug is released until the later phase of the transition.
      These results are analogous to the effects of intercalating drugs on the thermal 
      denaturation of DNA and indicate that drug molecules preferentially interact with
      B-form DNA and are redistributed to regions in the B conformation over the course
      of the transition. Comparative studies show that some intercalators stabilize
      right-handed DNA more effectively than others. At similar initial binding ratios,
      the following order, from most to least effective, was experimentally observed:
      actinomycin greater than daunomycin greater than ethidium greater than proflavin.

TI  - Thiol reactivity of histone H3 in soluble and DNA-associated histone complexes:
      evidence for allosteric and torsional regulation.
PG  - 8409-18
AB  - The reactivity of chick erythrocyte and calf thymus histone H3 thiol groups
      toward 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) has been investigated both in
      the soluble, DNA-free state and in various nucleohistone complexes. We have found
      that the thiol reactivity of both tetramers and octamers decreases continuously
      as the ionic strength of the assay is increased, up to and beyond 2.0 M NaCl.
      Upon association of dimers with tetramers, there is loss of labeling by DTNB at
      one site, suggesting the existence of allosteric regulation [see also Godfrey, J.
      E., Eickbush, T. H., & Moudrianakis, E. N. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 1339-1346] of 
      dimer-tetramer interfaces emanating from within the tetramer complex. Comparison 
      of the thiol reactivities of chick and calf tetramers indicates that the thiol
      groups at amino acid positions 96 and 110 are not chemically equivalent. When the
      histones are associated with DNA, in either reconstituted complexes, core
      particles, or long soluble chromatin, the thiol reactivity is greatly diminished,
      and this "DNA effect" overwhelms any influence of dimers. However, if
      single-strand nicks are introduced into the DNA backbone of core particles and
      other chromatin-like complexes by the action of DNase I, the influence of the DNA
      double helix upon thiol reactivity is reduced, and the effect of dimers can be
      detected once again. We can therefore conclude that the DNA effect derives from
      intranucleosomal torsional strain of the continuum of the double helix in
      equilibrium with coupled protein conformational changes. These observations
      support the concept that the octamer complex is a dynamic tripartite structure
      whose properties can be modulated through its interactions with DNA and by
      changes occurring in the dimer-tetramer interfaces.

TI  - Selective deamidation and enzymatic methylation of seminal ribonuclease.
PG  - 8361-8
AB  - Isoenzymatic forms alpha 2, alpha beta, and beta 2 of bovine seminal ribonuclease
      are generated by the transformation of beta-type into alpha-type subunit through 
      deamidation of a single amide group [Di Donato, A., & D'Alessio, G. (1981)
      Biochemistry 20, 7232-7237]. The residue involved in this selective deamidation
      has been identified as Asn67. Deamidation occurs by formation of a cyclic imide
      intermediate involving the Gly at position 68. Opening of the cyclic imide may
      occur on either side of the nitrogen, generating both the normal alpha-aspartyl
      and an isoaspartyl residue at position 67. The alpha-carboxyl of the isoaspartyl 
      residue is effectively methylated by bovine brain protein
      carboxylmethyltransferase.

TI  - Iron(II)-substituted metallothionein: evidence for the existence of iron-thiolate
      clusters.
PG  - 8353-6
AB  - Metallothioneins (MT's) are unique low molecular weight (Mr 6000-7000) metal- and
      cysteine-rich proteins characterized by two tetrahedral tetrathiolate clusters
      containing three and four metal ions. Naturally occurring proteins usually
      contain the diamagnetic metal ions Zn(II) and/or Cd(II). We have now succeeded in
      substituting these ions by paramagnetic Fe(II). Rabbit liver MT-1 in which all
      seven metal binding sites were occupied by Fe(II) ions displays absorption
      features typical of tetrahedral tetrathiolate Fe(II) coordination. This is
      documented by the presence of a ligand field 5E----5T2 transition in the
      near-infrared region centered at about 1850 nm (epsilon Fe approximately 100 M-1 
      cm-1) and a broad charge-transfer absorption in the UV region with a shoulder at 
      314 nm. A metal-thiolate cluster structure is inferred from the 7 to 20 ratio of 
      metal ions to cysteine residues and from spectral studies in which successive
      increments of Fe(II) were incorporated into the metal-free protein. Thus, to
      about 4 equiv, the charge-transfer absorption and magnetic circular dichroism
      (MCD) features of the complexes formed resemble closely those of reduced
      rubredoxin from Desulfovibro gigas in which tetrahedral tetrathiolate Fe(II)
      coordination is documented. However, upon further addition of Fe(II) ions, the
      charge-transfer absorption bands undergo a progressive red-shift until the full
      metal occupancy of seven Fe(II) ions per molecule is reached. The bathochromic
      shift which is also manifested in the MCD spectra can be ascribed to the
      transformation of some of the terminal thiolate ligands to bridging when the full
      complement of Fe(II) is bound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Rapid microassay for protein kinase C translocation in Swiss 3T3 cells.
PG  - 8348-53
AB  - The Ca2+/phosphatidylserine-stimulated protein kinase C (PKC) appears to exist as
      interconvertible inactive, soluble and active, membrane-bound forms. Changes in
      the bimodal distribution of PKC induced by diacylglycerol or tumor-promoting
      phorbol esters have been proposed to regulate the activity of this kinase
      [Nishizuka, Y. (1984) Nature (London) 308, 693-698]. A rapid microassay for
      assessment of protein kinase C translocation between cytosol and membranes was
      developed. This procedure, which relied on the selective digitonin-mediated
      release of cytoplasmic proteins, eliminated potential homogenization and
      fractionation artifacts. PKC activity toward histone H1 was determined after
      limited trypsinolysis, which abolished the Ca2+/phospholipid requirement of the
      enzyme and prevented interference by inhibitory proteins. Complete translocation 
      of PKC to the membrane fraction and subsequent down-regulation of the kinase in
      response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells
      could be demonstrated by this method. Platelet-derived growth factor,
      insulin-like growth factor 1, vasopressin, and prostaglandin F2 alpha facilitated
      partial conversions of PKC to the membrane-bound form in quiescent 3T3 cells.

AB  - Destabilization of liposomes composed of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
      purified glycophorin of human erythrocytes was studied with the release of an
      entrapped fluorescent dye, calcein. Proteolytic cleavage of liposomes by trypsin 
      induced a rapid increase of turbidity and the leakage of calcein from the
      liposomes. Kinetic experiments indicated that the destabilization was a second
      order reaction, i.e. it required liposome collision. Using
      N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) PE as a fluorescent probe for the formation 
      of hexagonal phase of PE, tryptic digestion of the liposomes resulted in a higher
      tendency of the PE bilayer to transform into the hexagonal phase. We propose that
      hexagonal (or inverted micellar) structures are involved in the trypsin induced

TI  - Precipitation of the D-galactose specific lectin from Erythrina indica by a
      triantennary complex type oligosaccharide.
PG  - 963-7
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that a high mannose type glycopeptide is bivalent
      for binding Concanavalin A (Con A) and can precipitate the lectin (Bhattacharyya 
      L. and Brewer, C.F. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 137, 670-674). The
      present results show that a triantennary complex type oligosaccharide containing 
      nonreducing terminal galactose residues can precipitate the
      D-galactose/N-acetyl-D-galactosamine specific lectin from Erythrina indica (EIL).
      The interactions of the oligosaccharide with EIL was investigated by quantitative
      precipitin analysis. The equivalence point of the precipitin curve indicated that
      the glycopeptide is trivalent for EIL binding. These results indicate that each
      arm of the oligosaccharide can independently bind separate lectin molecules
      leading to precipitation of the complex. These findings are discussed in terms of
      the possible biological structure-function properties of complex type
      oligosaccharides.

PG  - 937-41
AB  - Solubilized crystal protein of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis was
      fractionated by affinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody directed
      against the crystal's 28 kDa peptide. The 28 kDa peptide was found to be
      relatively nontoxic to mosquito larvae although it does contain the hemolytic
      activity of the crystals. The crystal protein fraction depleted of the 28 kDa
      peptide was found to be nonhemolytic and to retain nearly full toxicity to
      mosquito larvae. These results suggest that the 28 kDa peptide is not required
      for the toxicity of solubilized crystal protein.

PG  - 892-7
AB  - Isozymes 3-3 and 4-4 of rat liver glutathione S-transferase are stereoselectively
      inhibited by the diastereomers of
      9,10-dihydro-9-glutathionyl-10-hydroxyphenanthrene, 1. The conformation of the
      biphenyl moiety is the same in the enzyme -1 complex as in aqueous solution with 
      the glutathionyl and hydroxy groups in the axial positions. Isozyme 4-4 is also
      inhibited by the four diastereomers of
      1,2-diphenyl-1-(S-glutathionyl)-2-hydroxyethane. The stereoselectivity of
      inhibition is modest in all cases and is manifest in both the type of inhibition 
      as well as the magnitude of Ki.

TI  - Estrogenic activity of phenol red in rat anterior pituitary cells in culture.
PG  - 885-91
AB  - The estrogenic activity of phenol red, a pH indicator widely used in cell culture
      media, was studied in rat anterior pituitary cells. After 72 hours of incubation 
      with 40 microM phenol red, a 40-50% increase in prolactin cell content and a 100%
      stimulation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone induced luteinizing hormone 
      release was observed. Both effects could be completely reversed by simultaneous
      incubation with the antiestrogen LY156758. In the rat uterine [3H] estradiol
      binding assay, phenol red showed a significant displacement at concentrations
      above 10 microM while its concentration in the commonly used culture media is
      about 40 microM. From the present results, we conclude that phenol red acts as a 
      weak estrogen in normal tissues and that its estrogenic activity should be taken 
      into account in studies using estrogen-sensitive cell or tissue cultures.

TI  - Lectin interactions with the variant surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma brucei

PG  - 1274-8
AB  - The variant specific surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma brucei brucei is
      incorporated into lipid vesicles using 8M urea as an unfolding reagent. Pronase
      treatment of these proteoliposomes removes most of the protein, leaving a
      glycophospholipopeptide which is the membrane attachment site. We show here that 
      lectins, specific for mannose and galactose are able to recognize oligosaccharide
      residues on these proteoliposomes, using a straightforward aggregation assay. The
      relevance of these results obtained with the liposome model system to the
      accessibility of the surface antigens in living trypanosomes is discussed.

TI  - NMR studies of flexible opiate conformations at monoclonal antibody binding
      sites. I. Transferred nuclear Overhauser effects show bound conformations.
PG  - 1267-73
AB  - 500 MHz H, homonuclear, intra-molecular, transferred Nuclear Overhauser Effect
      measurements have been performed on the bound forms of a classical opiate
      antagonist, nalorphine and an agonist, levorphanol at their respective binding
      sites in two different specific anti-opiate monoclonal antibody fragments. Based 
      upon previous studies of opiate conformations in solution the results clearly
      show without extensive interpretation that one of these flexible haptens has the 
      opposite (from solution) isomeric conformation in its bound form. For nalorphine 
      the axial isomer of the N-allyl substituent is the bound form whereas in solution
      the equatorial isomer dominates at a ratio of 5:1. For levorphanol the bound form
      is that of equatorial N-methyl in accord with the low energy conformation in
      solution. In this preliminary report we discuss the initial measurements and
      results and their implications with respect to the conformations of flexible
      ligands at macromolecular binding sites including opiate receptors.

PG  - 1254-60
AB  - The growth inhibitory effect and the fate of prostaglandin A1 (10(-6) M) were
      followed in cultures of rat B104 neuroblastoma and C6 glioma cells. More than 40%
      and 85% of the drug were neither recognized by a prostaglandin A1 antiserum nor
      extracted from the acidified medium with ethyl acetate, after 6 h and 24
      h-incubation, respectively. When the supernatant of cells cultured in the
      presence of prostaglandin A1 during 24 hours was transferred to other cells and
      used as culture medium, the same growth inhibitory effect as with prostaglandin
      A1 was observed even when no prostaglandin A1 was added. After extensive
      purification and reverse phase HPLC of supernatant, four peaks more polar than
      prostaglandin A1 were shown; two of them were still active as growth inhibitors. 
      This biotransformation was not observed with normal cells like L 929 or chick
      embryo fibroblasts, for which prostaglandin A1 had no inhibitory effect. The
      identification of these metabolites will allow the study of the
      structure-activity relationship.

AB  - The expression of Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA gene 7 was investigated in
      Xenopus laevis oocytes. Cloned DNA injected into oocytes consisted of T-DNA
      sequences derived from octopine type Ti plasmid B6-806 and T-DNA attached to
      plant DNA sequences at the left junction in crown gall tumors. Transcription
      initiation sites observed in oocytes were similar to those for transcript 7 in
      crown gall tumors. Quantitative differences in transcription occurred depending
      on the flanking sequences of the injected clones indicating that sequences
      upstream of the TATA box of T-DNA gene 7 affect the quantitative expression of
      this gene in Xenopus oocytes.

TI  - Relative spectral response as a function of sequential ligand binding.
PG  - 1207-12
AB  - A unique method is presented for the determination of the critical number of
      ligands that must bind to a macromolecule to elicit a spectroscopic response.
      This method is based on analysis of ligand binding data. For example, four Ca2+
      and two Mg2+ ions are necessary for mirroring the relative decrease in the
      intrinsic fluorescence of bovine prothrombin fragment 1. For application of the
      method, ligand loading and relative spectroscopic response data must be measured 
      over a full range of concentrations.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes isolated from human tissues and rat
      liver are differentially inhibited by quercetin, alizarin, purpurogallin and
      ellagic acid. Rat liver GST isoenzymes are far more sensitive to these compounds 
      as compared to the human GST isoenzymes. Among human GST, the anionic isoenzymes 
      containing C type and A' type subunits are inhibited to a greater extent as
      compared to the cationic isoenzymes containing A and B type subunits. The anionic
      GST isoenzymes of human erythrocytes and placenta are differentially inhibited by
      these plant phenols indicating that the placental and erythrocyte isoenzymes may 
      be distinct proteins.

TI  - Changes of membrane fluidity in chemotactic peptide-stimulated polymorphonuclear 
      leukocytes.
PG  - 1151-6
AB  - Although the phenomenon of stimulus-response coupling in polymorphonuclear
      leukocytes involves a series of membrane events the influence of stimulation on
      membrane fluidity is to clarify. In our experiments we have used
      1-(4-trimethylaminophenyl) 6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and
      1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence polarization technique to evaluate
      membrane fluidity in living polymorphonuclear leukocytes after stimulation with
      N-formyl-methyonil-leucyl-phenylalanine peptide which has a well defined membrane
      receptor on the plasma membrane. We report that polymorphonuclear leukocytes
      stimulation increases 1-(4-trimethylaminophenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene
      polarization, only when colcemid, a microtubule disrupting drug, is added to
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This can be viewed as an indirect evidence that
      microtubules are involved in the control of polymorphonuclear leukocytes membrane
      fluidity. On the contrary no changes have been observed with
      1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. This study indicates the potential use of
      1-(4-trimethylaminophenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene to evaluate the involvement 
      of plasma membrane physical state during intact cell activity.

TI  - Potassium depolarisation markedly enhances muscarinic receptor stimulated
      inositol tetrakisphosphate accumulation in rat cerebral cortical slices.
PG  - 1130-7
AB  - Rat cerebral cortical slices labelled with [3H]-inositol were incubated with the 
      muscarinic agonist carbachol in media containing normal 5.9 mM or elevated 24 mM 
      K+ ions. Over the first few minutes both carbachol and elevated K+ stimulated the
      production of [3H]-inositol phosphates. The very rapid formation of [3H]-inositol
      tetrakis, tris and bisphosphate was followed by accumulation of [3H]-inositol
      monophosphate. However, elevated K+ resulted in a relatively larger stimulation
      of [3H]-inositol bisphosphate than muscarinic receptor stimulation. When
      carbachol effects were examined in media containing elevated K+, production of
      [3H]-inositol trisphosphate was apparently additive whereas the mono and
      bisphosphate displayed somewhat synergistic responses after 1-2 minutes. In
      contrast, [3H]-inositol tetrakisphosphate production was greatly enhanced and
      marked synergy was observed between the K+ and carbachol responses. The
      production of the tetrakisphosphate under these conditions was dependent on
      extracellular Ca2+ and a stimulatory effect of this divalent ion on the 3-kinase 
      is discussed.

PG  - 1116-22
AB  - The gene for chicken nerve growth factor was cloned by screening a chicken
      genomic library with a mouse nerve growth factor cDNA clone. Northern blot
      analysis indicated the presence of nerve growth factor mRNA throughout the
      central nervous system of the chick, with the highest levels in retina,
      midbrain/hindbrain and spinal cord. In embryonic brain, nerve growth factor mRNA 
      was expressed at low levels at day 8, with a progressive increase up to postnatal
      day 2. Substantial amounts of nerve growth factor mRNA were expressed in
      embryonic leg tissues at a time when the dorsal root ganglia that project to the 
      limb are maximally responsive to nerve growth factor.

PG  - 1051-7
AB  - A method for the quantitative analysis of N-oxalylcysteine and oxalyl thiolesters
      (RSCOCOO-) in biological samples is described. These compounds were found in all 
      rat tissues examined (kidney, liver, brain, heart, muscle and fat), with the
      amount of N-oxalylcysteine ranging up to 18 nmoles/g wet weight and that of
      oxalyl thiolesters up to 65 nmoles/g wet weight. The identification of such
      compounds in animal tissues adds further credence to the hypothesis that they may
      be important metabolic effectors.

PG  - 1012-7
AB  - The isotype of fibronectin present in human adult and fetal lung tissues was
      studied by limited proteolysis by cathepsin D followed by immunoblot analysis
      with domain-specific antibodies. The results indicate that the fibronectin in the
      adult lung tissue is predominantly the plasma-type whereas the fibronectin in the
      fetal lung tissue is more related to the cellular-type than to the plasma-type.
      Thus, it appears that the fibronectin isotype in tissue switches from the
      cellular-type to the plasma-type during ontogenesis.

PG  - 2359-67
AB  - The files of the Casualty Ward in a Florentine hospital for 1934-36, 1955-57 and 
      1976-78 were examined and 5030 cases of accidental injuries in the elderly were
      extracted for analysis. The subjects were grouped according to age, type and
      locality of the accident and morphology of the clinical picture. The results
      obtained from statistical analysis of the data demonstrate an increased
      percentage of accidents in the home, at work and in the street. Road accidents,
      the incidence of which varied in the different periods considered, were excluded.
      The outstanding feature is the notable increase in accidents of every type in the
      home, an environment traditionally considered safe or at least protected. Some
      medicolegal remarks on these results are presented with the aim of promoting a
      greater knowledge of the epidemiology of this phenomen as is essential if
      preventive measures are to be taken.

TI  - [Research on the psychological view of maternity in women in the puerperium].
PG  - 2349-58
AB  - The aim of our research was to observe the ways in which the hospital and the
      social environment react towards delivery and birth and how pregnant women
      experience this event from the psychological point of view. A questionnaire was
      submitted to 58 puerperas at their third-fifth day. From the analysis of the
      results we can observe that the hospital structure tends to treat this experience
      as a mechanical and routinary event; this particularly jouful moment which should
      be a time of celebration is often undervalued. As a matter of fact the hospital
      does not create an atmosphere of joy which should accompany any event connected
      with birth and which should be transmitted to the child offering him a sense of
      confidence from the very first moment of his life. Women are generally the
      victims of a culture of terror, originated by an ideology of "institutionalism"
      which tends to regard the process of birth as a medical phenomenon and not as a
      natural one, and so they prefer to hand over all responsibility to the
      specialist, instead of taking charge of it themselves. We have also noticed that 
      women very rarely undertake psycho-physical training before the delivery; the
      reasons may be the culture of terror or also because the training techniques are 
      considered inadequate for the psychological aspects. We have observed that most
      of all, women are frightened by the delivery itself and of giving birth to a
      deformed child. Women lack an experience of psychological growth which would help
      them to reach an emotional maturity. This is necessary to help the child to
      develop his infinite potential and abilities which he already possesses from the 
      moment he is born and which will help him to face whole heartedly the fascinating
      albeit painful adventure that is life.

TI  - [Clinical experience with the use of Amorosa, a low-mineral water, in athletes].
PG  - 2343-8
AB  - Nine semi-professional football players have been studied during a
      pre-championship retreat in a hilly area with their team. The nine athletes drank
      "Amorosa" oligo mineral water for three weeks and various haematochemical
      parameters (such as uricaemia, creatinemia, azotemia, sodium content) both before
      and after the retreat, have been evaluated. Furthermore, LDH and CPK were
      monitored before and after an exertion test on an exercise bicycle after
      hydropinic ingestion. The results obtained fully confirm the diuretic and
      cathartic properties of the water and its property of mobilization of
      hydroelectrolytic system which are even more useful in subjects needing a rapid
      elimination of metabolic wastes accumulated during muscle fatigue.

TI  - Fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymes in human skeletal muscle.
PG  - 327-33
AB  - An electrophoretic and enzyme-substrate staining technique for acyl-CoA
      dehydrogenase (ACD) enzymes was developed for use with small (less than 100 mg)
      tissue samples. Based on their electrophoretic mobility and substrate staining
      specificity, at least two and perhaps three chain-length specific enzymes for
      dehydrogenation of saturated fatty acids were found in human skeletal muscle. ACD
      enzymes staining with octanoyl-CoA or palmitoyl-CoA were identified by this
      technique in human skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, but the ACD enzyme staining
      with butyryl-CoA was difficult to detect and was definitely visualized only in
      skeletal muscle.

TI  - Quantitation of serum lactate dehydrogenase-5 with monoclonal antibodies.
PG  - 315-25
AB  - Spleen cells from BALB/cJ mice which had been immunized with human lactate
      dehydrogenase-1 (LDH-1) were fused with SP2/0-Ag14. Two hybridomas were produced 
      which recognized the antigen. Competitive RIA revealed that one antibody
      ('Smit-LDH') recognized the H subunit of LDH while the other ('Hem-LDH')
      recognized both H and M subunits of LDH. With the use of these antibodies we
      developed an assay for LDH-5 activity in which serum is incubated for 30 min at
      room temperature with the two antibodies ('Smit-LDH' and 'Hem-LDH' in the ratio
      64:1.3, micrograms/ml) immobilized on latex beads to extract LDH-1 through LDH-4.
      After centrifugation, the LDH activity of the supernatant is measured and
      represents LDH-5 activity. Latex beads coated with bovine serum albumin were used
      as control. The LDH-5 activity as determined by our assay correlated well (r =
      0.98) with the values obtained by an electrophoresis method. There was no
      interference due to LDH-1 through LDH-3 up to 3,000 U/l and LDH-4 up to 350 U/l. 
      Serum samples with total LDH activity above 1,000 U/l were appropriately diluted 
      in order to avoid interference by LDH-4. Use of these monoclonal antibodies
      allows precise, rapid and direct measurement of LDH-5 activity in serum.

TI  - Lysosomal enzyme activities in fresh and frozen chorionic villi and in cultured
      trophoblasts.
PG  - 307-13
AB  - Fifteen lysosomal enzyme activities were compared in 14 presumed normal chorionic
      villus specimens that were each divided, processed and analyzed as fresh tissue, 
      tissue frozen for 1 week, and cultures established from minced whole villi. Most 
      of the activities determined in the chorionic villus tissue were not affected
      significantly by freezing. However, activities for most enzymes were
      significantly different from those determined in the cultured cells. Our
      experience with first trimester prenatal evaluations for several lysosomal
      disorders showed that the limited amount of tissue obtained is not always
      sufficient for thorough analysis and thus, cultured trophoblasts derived from the
      tissue specimen should also be examined. The results of this study stress the
      importance of using appropriate tissue-type and cell-type controls to establish
      the normal range in the respective analyses.

TI  - Effect of parathyroid hormone and uremia on erythrocyte deformability.
PG  - 293-9
AB  - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) caused a significant decrease in human erythrocyte
      filtration rate (EFR). This effect was Ca2+-dependent and was partially reversed 
      by the Ca2+ blocker verapamil. It was mimicked by the Ca2+ ionophore A-23187.
      Mg2+ even at high concentrations could not substitute for Ca2+. There was a dose 
      response between the filtration rate and Ca2+ or PTH concentrations. Serum
      ultrafiltrate of patients with chronic renal failure and secondary
      hyperparathyroidism caused significant inhibition similar to that seen with PTH
      extract. Ultrafiltrate from patients with chronic renal failure following
      parathyroidectomy and from healthy individuals did not cause this phenomenon.
      Erythroyctes deformability in uremic patients appears to be caused by high PTH
      levels. Our present findings agree with ones about the toxic effects of PTH on
      various biological systems.

TI  - Substrate specificity of alkaline phosphatase from human polymorphonuclear
      leukocytes.
PG  - 283-91
AB  - The ability of alkaline phosphatase in purified preparations from human
      neutrophils and liver to utilize ATP or inorganic pyrophosphate as substrate
      depended upon the Mg2+ concentration. With pyrophosphate present (1.0 mmol/l),
      activity peaked at Mg2+ concentrations of 0.25 to 0.50 mmol/l and fell sharply
      above this. By contrast, p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity was activated with
      Mg2+ concentration up to 0.75 mmol/l but above this was constant to 5.0 mmol/l.
      Hydrolysis was abolished by L-levamisole, a specific inhibitor of alkaline
      phosphatase. Testing butanol extracts of neutrophils from 50 healthy subjects
      showed good correlation of enzyme activity with p-nitrophenylphosphate and ADP (r
      = 0.90), and between p-nitrophenylphosphate and pyridoxal phosphate (r = 0.96) as
      substrate, consistent with hydrolysis of all three phosphoesters by one enzyme.
      Inhibition studies yielded no evidence of a specific pyridoxal phosphatase.
      Alkaline phosphatase from human neutrophils has the same broad substrate
      specificity as other molecular forms of the human enzyme and, like other forms,
      has little or no activity towards phosphoesters complexed with Mg2+.

TI  - Unconjugated pteridines in amniotic fluid during gestation.
PG  - 269-73
AB  - Neopterin and biopterin concentrations were measured in amniotic fluid in 226
      pregnancies from the 12th week of gestation to term. At mid-gestation, neopterin 
      and biopterin levels were low and remained relatively constant between 12 and 26 
      weeks of gestation, whereas during the third trimester, a progressive increase
      was observed. Near term the values were greater than those in maternal serum and 
      the higher neopterin to biopterin ratio suggested that pteridine concentration in
      amniotic fluid may reflect the maturation of pteridine metabolism in the fetus.

PG  - 259-68
AB  - Lactate dehydrogenase activities were determined in CSF from 350 patients
      suffering from various neurological diseases. Reference values were established
      as 0-26 U/l. Slight elevations of CSF LDH activities were observed in patients
      with the following disorders: brain metastasis and spinal epidural metastasis
      from solid carcinomas, primary central nervous system tumours, cerebrovascular
      accident, polyneuropathy and head injury. Marked elevations were observed
      incidentally in patients in these groups and in a considerable number of patients
      with bacterial meningitis and with leptomeningeal spread from solid or
      haematologic malignancies. When other diagnostic information is available for the
      proper estimation of the pre-test likelihood of disease, CSF LDH activities
      exceeding 50 U/l are suggestive for meningeal carcinomatosis.

TI  - Serum concentrations of laminin and aminoterminal propeptide of type III
      procollagen in relation to the portal venous pressure of fibrotic liver diseases.
PG  - 249-58
AB  - In sera of patients with fibrotic liver diseases (n = 33) classified
      histologically into various degrees of liver fibrosis (n = 21) and cirrhosis (n =
      12) the concentrations of the basement membrane protein laminin and of its
      pepsinresistant fragment P1 and of the N-terminal propeptide of type III
      procollagen were determined. The concentrations of both proteins were related to 
      the portal venous pressure measured in these patients. Compared with the
      reference population (n = 146) the concentration of laminin increases from 1.04
      U/ml (normal persons) to 1.69 +/- 0.46 U/ml in liver fibrotic and 2.58 +/- 0.87
      U/ml in liver cirrhotic patients. Although the concentrations of the propeptide
      of type III procollagen increase also there exist only weak correlations between 
      both connective tissue proteins in serum. Laminin is correlated highly positive
      with the portal venous pressure in cirrhotic subjects (r = 0.9206), the extent of
      laminin elevation reflects closely the degree of portal hypertension. Virtually
      all of the fibrotic patients having a laminin concentration within the reference 
      range had a normal portal venous pressure. The data suggest laminin as a
      potentially useful parameter for monitoring the portal venous pressure in
      cirrhotic and severe fibrotic patients.

TI  - Blood dyscrasias and topically applied chloramphenicol in ophthalmology.
PG  - 87-95
AB  - The case reports presented so far, concerning a possible causative relationship
      between the ophthalmological use of chloramphenicol (O-CAP) and blood dyscrasias,
      are few in number, not always fully documented and therefore not always
      convincing. The overall use of this drug in a restricted area in the Netherlands 
      was assessed. On a yearly basis 1:29 people used O-CAP. In a four-year period in 
      the same area, 12 patients with aplastic anemia and 190 patients with other
      cytopenic dyscrasias were found. After exclusion of all cases with other possible
      causes of the dyscrasia, e.g. cancer and related therapy, other drugs than O-CAP 
      and infectious diseases, 59 cases remained in which a definite cause could not be
      established. We traced back the use of O-CAP in the relevant period. No
      dyscrasias were found that unequivocally were caused by O-CAP. The rate of O-CAP 
      use in the dyscrasia-group was approximately equal to that in the population as a
      whole. Hence we concluded that it is highly improbable that O-CAP played a part
      in the etiology of blood dyscrasias in the region. Statistical evaluation of
      material derived from a much larger region may, however, lead to a more
      differentiated conclusion.

TI  - Prevention of IOP-rise following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy with pre-operative
      timolol eye-drops and 1 tablet acetazolamide 250 mg systematically.
PG  - 59-67
AB  - Short-term observation following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy indicates that serious 
      elevation of intra-ocular pressure may occur, unrelated to the amount of energy
      used. In this study the IOP in 3 groups of 10 pseudophakic patients undergoing
      Nd-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was measured before capsulotomy and 2 and 4
      hours afterwards, using the fellow-eye as control. The first group received no
      medication, the second received timolol 1/2% eyedrops preoperatively, the third
      group a combination of timolol 1/2% and 1 tablet of acetazolamide 250 mg
      systemically. Pretreatment with timolol 0.5% minimizes IOP-rise but does not give
      complete protection. The combination of timolol 0.5% with 1 tablet of
      acetazolamide 250 mg proves to be a safe procedure for the prevention of IOP-rise
      after YAG laser capsulotomy. To prevent other complications it is advisable to
      make a small capsulotomy of 2-3 mm diameter using as little energy as possible.
      Also a defocussing system in the laser is a great advantage. Indomethacin drops
      during a period of 6 weeks after Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy should prevent cystoid 
      macular edema.

TI  - Aqueous chamber taps in toxoplasmic chorioretinitis.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - The clinical value of the determination of toxoplasma antibodies in anterior
      chamber taps was evaluated in 12 posterior uveitis patients suspected of a
      toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, in four patients with Fuchs's heterochromia and in
      31 cataract patients. The posterior uveitis patients all had marked inflammation 
      of the vitreous obstructing the examination of the fundus of the time of aqueous 
      humour aspiration. The clinical diagnosis toxoplasmic uveitis (n = 9) was made
      after the inflammation of the vitreous had subsided and fundus examination became
      possible again. Paired serum and aqueous samples were tested for total
      immunoglobulin levels and toxoplasma antibodies. Eight of the nine clinical
      toxoplasmic uveitis patients had detectable toxoplasma antibodies in their
      aqueous, whereas none of the other seven uveitis patients were positive. All of
      these eight toxoplasmic uveitis patients had a coefficient above 1.5. Of the 31
      control patients only one had a positive antibody titer at a dilution of 1/2 with
      a corresponding coefficient of 1.1. This study shows that aqueous humour
      examination for toxoplasma antibodies is a valuable diagnostic tool in a selected
      group of posterior uveitis patients.

AB  - The case history is given of a woman of 65 (in 1973) with a granulomatous
      conjunctival inflammation in the right eye and chronic recurrent polyps on the
      vocal cords. Several times, granulomatous tissue was removed from the conjunctiva
      of the right eye but the result was recurrences at shorter intervals. Seven years
      after the onset in the right eye the left eye became affected. Various
      treatments, both systemic and local, were tried without success. The histological
      diagnosis of ligneous conjunctivitis was not made until 1981. Treatment with the 
      known remedies for ligneous conjunctivitis was not successful. At the end of 1984
      treatment with Imuran (azathioprine) was started. Since that time the patient has
      been practically free of recurrent granulomatous tissue on the conjunctiva and
      vocal cords. The treatment of ligneous conjunctivitis with Imuran has not
      previously been reported in the literature.

TI  - Topical application of 5-fluorouracil in premalignant lesions of cornea,

PG  - 31-42
AB  - Local application of 5-Fluorouracil was practised on 5 patients. In 3 patients
      with multiple premalignant oculo-cutaneous lesions, two of whom had also
      premalignant epibulbar lesions, local 5% 5-Fu cream and/or 1% 5-Fu eyedrops were 
      applied. In 2 other patients who had only premalignant lesions on the cornea and 
      conjunctiva, 1% 5-Fu eyedrops were used only. In animal experiments 1% 5-Fu was
      not found to cause any damage to normal corneal and conjunctival epithelium. The 
      frequency of the applications and the duration of the treatment were dependent on
      the location and extent of the lesions. Except for easily treatable lesions,
      caused by the separation of the tumour epithelium, no complications of local 5-Fu
      treatment were seen. The visual acuity improved in all 4 patients in whom the
      cornea was affected. In these premalignant conditions the diagnosis and
      assessment of the therapy were based on exfoliative cytology and biopsies.

PG  - 143-52
AB  - A polypropylene surgical suture, which had served as fixation suture for an IOL
      for a period of 6.5 years, was removed from the eye of a Dutch patient because it
      had broken at one end and thus formed a potential risk for a corneal touch
      syndrome. After careful rinsing in 50% ethanol, to remove adhering debris, it was
      prepared for SEM. A virgin piece of polypropylene material from a surgical
      package underwent the same preparative procedure. The fixation suture showed
      cracks perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the suture; part of the surface 
      layer was nearly detached or completely missing; while the diameter of the suture
      was decreased towards both ends by over 50% in comparison with the original
      diameter. The exposed subsurface layer showed a fibrillar structure. The
      degradation phenomena are considered to be caused by the enzymatic action of
      tissue-fluids. Virgin material did not show any of the phenomena observed on the 
      fixation suture under consideration.

      almost completely disintegrated cell membrane, exposing the cell contents. On the
      endothelial surface of the keratoconus cells were found with a missing
      cell-nucleus and a perforated cell membrane, due to a 'Kammerwasser Einbruch'
      effect.

AB  - The naked human vitreous (sclera, iris and cornea removed) suspended in water
      does not reveal inner structures. After ink injection into the vitreous, the
      presence of different compartments and the existence of cisterns becomes evident.
      A concept of the internal system of cisterns is given on the basis of
      stereoscopic-lightmicroscopic images. An attempt is made to correlate images of
      the complete vitreous body, obtained with a stereo-lightmicroscope, with images
      of segments of cisternal walls produced with a scanning electron-microscope
      (SEM). A comparison is made between SEM-images of the vitreous bodies of human
      and rabbit eyes.

AB  - Eighteen consecutive patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy following
      retinal detachment were treated with radical pars-plana vitrectomy and silicone
      oil injection. At least 6 months follow-up demonstrated fully attached retinas in
      12 patients, partly attached retinas in 3 patients and primary failure in 3
      patients. The visual fields revealed serious defects in 50% of those patients
      with attached retinas. The expected complications such as cataract (100%),
      glaucoma, corneal decompensation and subretinal oil were seen as well, but the
      complication rate is expected to diminish with newer surgical techniques.

TI  - Effect of pancreatic polypeptide on the motility of the guinea-pig small
      intestine in vitro.
PG  - 305-14
AB  - The effect of porcine pancreatic polypeptide (PP) on the motor activity of the
      longitudinal and circular muscles of the guinea-pig isolated small intestine was 
      investigated. PP (0.2-20 nM) inhibited cholinergic contractions of the
      longitudinal muscle in response to electrical field stimulation, the maximal
      effect being a 30% reduction of the contraction amplitude. Carbachol-induced
      contractions of the longitudinal muscle were not affected by PP (10 nM). PP
      (0.3-30 nM) also inhibited reflex contractions of the circular muscle elicited by
      balloon distension and recorded orally to the site of distension; the maximal
      effect was a 80% reduction of the reflex contraction. In contrast,
      carbachol-induced contractions of the circular muscle remained unaltered by PP
      (10 nM). It was further found that PP (10 and 100 nM) enhanced the threshold
      intraluminal pressure at which peristaltic waves were triggered. All these
      effects of PP appeared to be transient. Taken together, these data indicate that 
      PP does not act on intestinal smooth muscle but can modulate the activity of
      certain enteric neurones which are involved in the regulation of intestinal
      motility.

TI  - Effect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on steroidogenesis in women.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - The VIPergic nervous system appears to be the major peptide-containing neuronal
      component in the female genital tract. Evidence has been put forward that
      exogenous VIP is able to stimulate progesterone secretion. In the present study
      the effect of human VIP (900 pmol/kg body weight per h i.v. during 30 min) on
      steroidogenesis in six female volunteers was investigated. The experiments were
      performed between the 6th and 14th day of their menstrual cycle, and peripheral
      venous blood was collected before, during and after infusion of VIP. The
      concentrations of VIP, oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione
      (AD), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHAS), sex
      hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and cortisol were measured. The infusion of VIP
      was accompanied by a 15% increase (P less than 0.05) in serum oestradiol
      concentrations, from a mean basal concentration of 0.58 nmol/l. The
      concentrations of testosterone and DHT also increased significantly. No effect of
      VIP on progesterone, AD, DHAS, SHBG or cortisol was observed. In the light of the
      presence of VIP in nerve fibres of the steroid producing tissue, this stimulatory
      effect of VIP might reflect a direct action on the ovary or the adrenal gland.

      appeared to be heterogeneous and Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated
      the presence of at least two classes of sites. The high-affinity low-capacity
      binding sites and the low-affinity high-capacity binding sites had apparent
      dissociation constants of 1.3 X 10(-7) mol/l and 4.2 X 10(-6) mol/l,
      respectively. The PSP induced inhibition of the adenylate cyclase activity was
      independent of the stimulatory state of the enzyme. The basal activity as well as
      that stimulated by VIP and secretin was half maximally inhibited at approximately
      3 X 10(-5) mol/l of PSP. The inhibitory effect of PSP was independent of the
      agonist concentration employed. PSP did not affect the receptor binding of VIP
      nor did VIP affect the receptor binding of PSP.

PG  - 281-90
AB  - New glutaramic acid derivatives with cholecystokinin antagonistic activity were
      evaluated for their capacity to inhibit the satiety effect induced in the rat by 
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8). The most
      active compound, CR 1409, is about 4000 times more potent than proglumide when
      injected peripherally (i.p.). This compound competitively inhibits the action of 
      CCK-8 at the receptor responsible for the satiety effect. In contrast, CR 1409,
      i.p. or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected does not exhibit antagonistic
      effects when CCK-8 is administered i.c.v., confirming the existence of at least
      two different populations of CCK receptors.

TI  - Identification and localization of material with gastrin-like immunoreactivity in
      the neural ganglion of a protochordate, Ciona intestinalis.
PG  - 269-79
AB  - Little is known of the identity of gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK)-like peptides in
      protochordates. These animals are at a level of organization corresponding to
      that from which the vertebrate line arose; in order to shed light on the origins 
      of gastrin/CCK-like peptides, we have studied by immunochemical methods these
      peptides in a protochordate, Ciona intestinalis. In radioimmunoassay, boiling
      water extracts of the neural ganglion reacted with C-terminal specific
      gastrin/CCK antibodies, but not N-terminal or intact G17 specific antibodies. Of 
      particular importance was the fact that a gastrin antibody which reacts weakly
      with CCK8 showed full activity with the Ciona material, suggesting that it
      resembles the C-terminus of gastrin. A single major peak was found by gel
      filtration and HPLC. In immunohistochemistry, nerve cell bodies were found in the
      cortical regions of the ganglion, and abundant fibres ramified in the central
      neuropile. We conclude that peptides of the gastrin/CCK series occur in nervous
      tissue in protochordates, and that while they are distinguishable from known
      forms of both gastrin and CCK, they resemble C-terminal fragments of the
      mammalian gastrins.

      YPPQPESPGGNASPEDWAKYHAAVRHYVNLITRQRYNH2 The presence of a COOH-terminally
      alpha-amidated amino acid was established using an HPLC method of general
      applicability. Although the peptide shows strong homology towards anglerfish
      pancreatic polypeptide (86%), homology towards porcine peptide YY (PYY) (61%) and
      porcine neuropeptide Y (NPY) (61%) was greater than towards porcine pancreatic
      polypeptide (PP) (47%). This result supports suggestions that the gene
      duplication events which led to PP, NPY and PYY formation took place after the
      time of divergence of fish and mammals.

AB  - Two XP patients are presented. A corneal perforation in the left eye of the first
      patient necessitated an at-random transplantation a chaud. The graft was
      remarkably well tolerated, which is possibly explained by UV-light-induced
      suppression of the cellular immune response in the patient. The right eye of this
      patient and both eyes of the second patient had a keratoconus. Keratoconus in XP 
      may be the result of disturbances in the cell differentiation and the function of
      epithelial cells and keratocytes, due to UV-light-induced deficient DNA repair
      synthesis.

TI  - Expression of HLA antigens in paraffin sections of uveal melanomas.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - Expression of histocompatibility (HLA) antigens on tumor cells may influence the 
      recognition of these tumor cells by the immune system. Immunological recognition 
      may influence tumor growth and patient survival. Although HLA class I and II
      antigens are known to be present on several tissues in the eye, their presence on
      ocular tumors had not yet been demonstrated. We studied the expression of these
      antigens on paraffin preparations of uveal melanomas. Most tumors carried class I
      and beta 2m antigens on most of their cells while class II antigens were less
      often expressed. No association with tumor cell type or tumor size was observed. 
      Further studies will be necessary to determine the relevance of different levels 
      of antigen expression with regard to patient survival.

PG  - 43-51
AB  - Corneal epithelium antibodies were detected in patients with corneal melting
      disease (55%), uveitis (42%), corneal transplantation (42%) and marginal furrow
      disease (20%). These antibodies were not found in herpetic keratitis patients. In
      control groups, consisting of ocular surgery patients (glaucoma, retinal
      detachment and cataract) and persons without a history of ocular disease,
      approximately 4% of the subjects had these antibodies. To investigate the
      possible role of trauma to the cornea as an initiator of corneal epithelium
      antibodies, these antibodies were determined in rabbits after alkaline burns were
      made on the cornea. These antibodies were detected one week later and disappeared
      after six weeks. Serum from three patients with corneal melting disease and
      corneal transplantation containing a high antibody titre against corneal
      epithelium were used to isolate corneal epithelium antigens. A 54 kD and a 17 kD 
      corneal epithelium antigen were isolated. The incidence of autoantibodies
      directed against these antigens was investigated in patients with corneal melting
      disease, uveitis and corneal transplantation using an ELISA. 50% of the sera
      positive in the immunofluorescence test were positive in the ELISA.

PG  - 105-8
AB  - Radial interrupted nylon sutures were placed in the corneas of fourteen human
      donor eyes, in a laboratory setting, to produce a reversible surgical correction 
      of myopia. Significant corneal flattening was achieved when a small optical zone 
      (4-5 mm) was left free but not with a larger optical zone. It may be possible
      that radial sutures have a permanent flattening effect when the sutures are left 
      in place and keep their tensile strength.

TI  - Structural and functional properties of a phospholipase A2 purified from an
      inflammatory exudate.
PG  - 8381-5
AB  - The cell-free supernatant of sterile inflammatory peritoneal exudates contains a 
      phospholipase A2 that participates in the digestion of Escherichia coli killed by
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes or by the purified bactericidal/permeability
      increasing protein (BPI) of these cells. This phospholipase A2 has been purified,
      and the sequence of the NH2-terminal 39 amino acids has been determined and
      compared with sequences of both BPI-responsive and BPI-nonresponsive
      phospholipases A2 from snake venoms and mammalian pancreas. The high
      concentration and location of basic residues in the NH2-terminal region is a
      common feature of BPI-responsive phospholipases A2 and may characterize those
      phospholipases A2 participating in inflammatory events.

TI  - Demethylation of bacterial chemoreceptors is inhibited by attractant stimuli in
      the complete absence of the regulatory domain of the demethylating enzyme.
PG  - 918-23
AB  - The CheB methylesterase catalyzes the demethylation of membrane receptors during 
      chemotaxis in Salmonella typhimurium. The kinetic properties of the full length
      product of the cheB gene are compared to those of the isolated C-terminal
      catalytic domain. The fragment has at least a 15-fold higher specific activity
      than the intact protein. In intact cells receptor demethylation is inhibited by
      attractants such as L-aspartate. We show here that both forms of the enzyme are
      similarly inhibited in vitro. Thus, the C-terminal catalytic domain of the CheB
      protein is sufficient for this aspect of esterase regulation. Inhibition by
      attractants appears to be caused by changes in receptor conformation rather than 
      by changes in the activity of the demethylating enzyme.

TI  - Effects of oral glucose administration on preproinsulin mRNA in rats in vivo.
PG  - 1201-6
AB  - An experiment was performed to examine whether the acute increase in insulin
      release induced by oral glucose ingestion is associated with alterations in
      pancreatic preproinsulin mRNA (PImRNA) levels. Rats either fed ad libitum or
      after overnight fast were used. Fasted rats were administered glucose orally in a
      conscious, unrestrained state. Pancreatic RNA was extracted and the relative
      level of PImRNA was determined by dot blot analysis with a cloned rat
      preproinsulin I cDNA probe. In fasted animals PImRNA levels decreased compared
      with those of fed animals and showed no significant changes after acute glucose
      administration, while blood glucose and plasma insulin increased rapidly to
      maximum values at 15 min after glucose administration. Although the transcription
      rate was not directly measured in this experiment, it is possible that the rapid 
      increase in insulin release from the beta cell under physiological conditions is 
      controlled by post-transcriptional regulations.

PG  - 1099-103
AB  - The gene encoding a proteinous alpha-amylase inhibitor (HaimII) of Streptomyces
      griseosporeus YM-25 has been cloned in Escherichia coli K12 using a
      deoxyinosine-containing synthetic oligonucleotide as the probe. A 1.6 kilobases
      BamHI fragment was confirmed to hybridize with the probe and subcloned in an E.
      coli-S. lividans shuttle vector. The plasmid clone was transferred into S.
      lividans by transformation. An appreciable amount of alpha-amylase inhibitor
      activity was found in the culture medium of S. lividans harboring the plasmid. As
      the specificity was indistinguishable from that of HaimII produced by the
      original S. griseosporeus strain, we concluded that the HaimII protein was
      synthesized in S. lividans and excreted into the medium.

PG  - 1084-91
AB  - The amino acid sequence of a peptide isolated from the Pacific salmon
      (Oncorhynchus kisutch) endocrine pancreas has been determined. This simple 36
      residue peptide is a member of the pancreatic polypeptide family. It contains a
      C-terminal tyrosinamide and is more homologous with porcine neuropeptide Y (NPY) 
      (83%) and peptide YY (75%) than any of the previously characterized pancreatic
      polypeptides (PP). This peptide appears to be the major but not the only
      representative of this family of peptides present in the endocrine pancreas of
      this fish. This peptide is referred to as salmon pancreatic polypeptide (salmon
      PP).

TI  - Epidermal growth factor in blood.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - The presence of receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in a wide variety of 
      human tissues and also some tumours indicates an as yet undefined role for EGF
      and it is therefore necessary to know precise concentrations in blood and other
      fluids. We have investigated the occurrence of EGF in the circulation and found
      that in platelet rich plasma, EGF levels were 51 +/- 5 pmol/l (mean +/- S.E.M., n
      = 6) while in platelet poor plasma levels were 2.9 +/- 0.9 pmol/1. In contrast,
      serum EGF was 37 +/- 7 pmol/l if separated at 30 min and rose to 117 +/- 5 pmol/l
      if separated at 270 min. Gel chromatography showed that all residual EGF
      immunoreactivity in platelet poor plasma resided in the high molecular weight
      form thought to be non biologically active. In serum, delay in separation
      resulted in an increase in the proportion of EGF immunoreactivity co-eluting with
      EGF standard. These results suggest that EGF in the circulation is associated
      with platelets and that the process of blood coagulation leads to release of free
      EGF.

      monomeric type III collagen in a saturable (KD = 1 X 10(-8) M), specific, and
      rapid manner with a stoichiometry of approximately 1:15 [vWf subunit (Mr

      of vWf, termed M11 residues 542-622 and M20 residues 948-998 [Titani, K., Kumar, 
      S., Takio, K., Ericsson, L. H., Wade, R. D., Ashida, K., Walsh, K. A., Chopek, M.
      W., Sadler, J. E., & Fujikawa, K. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3171-3184], inhibited
      vWf binding to collagen. With 125I-vWf (2 X 10(-9) M) as ligand, M11, M20,
      fragment III (a dimeric, V8 protease, NH2-terminal fragment, Mr 320,000
      referenced above), and unlabeled vWf inhibited binding to collagen with EC50
      values of 4.8 X 10(-7), 9.4 X 10(-7), 1.1 X 10(-7), and 0.2 X 10(-7) M,
      respectively. M11 and M20 bind to collagen directly when 125I-labeled peptides
      are used as ligands. Other CNBr fragments of vWf were less effective as
      inhibitors (5-fold or less) and bound less avidly to collagen (5-fold or less)
      compared to M11 and M20. A murine anti-human vWf monoclonal antibody (MR5), which
      blocks the binding of vWf to collagen, bound selectively to both M11 and M20 when
      tested in an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - PDGF-like growth factor induces EGF-potentiated phenotypic transformation of
      normal rat kidney cells in the absence of TGF beta.
PG  - 1229-35
AB  - Using a growth factor defined assay for anchorage-independent growth (van Zoelen,
      E.J.J., van Oostwaard, Th.M.J., van der Saag, P.T. and de Laat, S.W. (1985) J.
      Cell. Physiol. 123, 151- 160, we have studied the ability of polypeptide growth
      factors produced by Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cells to induce anchorage-independent 
      growth of normal rat kidney cells. Neuro-2A cells produce and secrete a PDGF-like
      growth factor in addition to TGF beta, which can be fully separated from each
      other by means of reverse-phase HPLC. Using a new, very sensitive technique for
      detection of TGF beta in growth factor samples based on its additional ability to
      act as a growth inhibitory factor, it is shown that the PDGF-like growth factor
      does not contain any detectable TGF beta. Still this neuroblastoma derived
      PDGF-like growth factor is able to induce anchorage-independent growth of NRK
      cells, particularly in the additional presence of EGF. It is concluded that under
      growth factor defined assay conditions TGF beta is not essential for phenotypic
      transformation of NRK cells.

TI  - Primate evolution of the alpha-globin gene cluster and its Alu-like repeats.
PG  - 693-709
AB  - The arrangement of alpha-globin genes in Old World and New World monkeys and a
      prosimian, galago, has been determined by restriction mapping. Recombinant DNAs
      containing galago and Old World monkey alpha-globin genes have been isolated and 
      subjected to a partial sequence determination for comparison to alpha-globin
      genes in human, chimpanzee and non-primate mammals. The results of this extensive
      structural analysis are relevant to several topics concerning the evolution of
      primate alpha-globin genes and Alu family repeats. All orders of higher primates 
      (i.e. Old and New World monkeys, chimpanzee and human) have the same arrangement 
      of alpha-globin genes. In contrast, the arrangement and correction of galago
      alpha-globin genes differ from those of higher primates, but are similar to those
      of non-primate mammals. The 5' and 3'-flanking regions of the human alpha 1 gene 
      are orthologous to the corresponding region in galago, identifying the human
      alpha 2 gene as the more recently duplicated gene. The human psi alpha 1 gene is 
      found to be inactivated after divergence of the human and galago lineages but
      prior to the divergence of human and monkey. Orthologous Alu family members in
      human and monkey DNAs indicate that the dispersion of some Alu repeats occurred
      prior to the divergence of these lineages. However, the Alu-like repeats of
      prosimian and higher primates result from entirely independent events giving rise
      to different repeat elements inserted at distinct genomic positions.

TI  - Both hydrophobic domains of M13 procoat are required to initiate membrane
      insertion.
PG  - 3681-5
AB  - M13 procoat protein has two hydrophobic domains, one in the leader peptide and
      one which anchors the mature coat protein in the membrane. Disruption of the
      membrane anchor region by insertion of arginyl residues does not yield
      periplasmic coat protein. Instead, the rate of membrane assembly is slowed
      greater than 100-fold (t1/2 less than 5 s for wild-type, t1/2 greater than 10 min
      for mutant). The hydrophobic region of mature coat protein not only functions as 
      a membrane anchor, but has an important role in the membrane assembly process per
      se.

TI  - Suppression of defective RAS1 and RAS2 functions in yeast by an adenylate cyclase
      activated by a single amino acid change.
PG  - 3657-63
AB  - We have constructed the yeast strain TS1, with the RAS2 gene replaced by mutant
      allele encoding a partially defective gene product, and with an inactive RAS1
      gene. TS1 cells accumulate as unbudded cells upon temperature shift from 30 to 37
      degrees C, thus showing that the RAS1 and RAS2 gene functions are important for
      progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. After the isolation of
      revertants able to grow at the nonpermissive temperature, we have found that a
      chromosomal point mutation can bypass the G1 arrest of TS1 and cdc25 cells, and
      the lethality of ras1 ras2 mutants. The mutation predicts the replacement of
      threonine by isoleucine at position 1651 of yeast adenylate cyclase. The
      RAS-independent, as well as the RAS-dependent adenylate cyclase activity, is
      increased by the mutation. Like the wild-type enzyme, the RAS-dependent activity 
      of the mutant adenylate cyclase is turned on by the GTP-bound form of the RAS2
      protein. The amino acid sequence surrounding the threonine 1651 shows similarity 
      with protein kinase substrates. Possible implications for the function of
      adenylate cyclase are discussed.

TI  - Targeting efficiency of a mitochondrial pre-sequence is dependent on the
      passenger protein.
PG  - 3643-50
AB  - The mitochondrial matrix enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) of
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae is encoded in the nucleus. It is synthesized as a
      precursor with an NH2-terminal extension of 26 amino acids which is cleaved off
      during import into the mitochondrion. Fusions between the NH2-terminal 34 amino
      acids of SOD and the cytosolic proteins invertase of yeast and mouse
      dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were tested for in vitro binding and import into
      mitochondria. Efficient translocation over the mitochondrial membranes takes
      place in the case of the SOD-DHFR fusion. The SOD-invertase fusion protein does
      not get translocated and binds to the organelle with only low efficiency. Yeast
      transformants harbouring the SOD-invertase fusion gene accumulate approximately
      95% of the hybrid protein in the cytosol. The remaining material is found in the 
      interior of the mitochondrion, loosely attached to the inner membrane. We
      conclude that the pre-sequence of SOD is able to deliver a passenger protein to
      the mitochondrion. The efficiency of protein delivery and translocation across
      the membrane is, however, influenced by the passenger protein.

TI  - C-myc expression is dissociated from DNA synthesis and cell division in Xenopus
      oocyte and early embryonic development.
PG  - 3571-7
AB  - The combined use of a human c-myc probe and of an antibody raised against the
      human c-myc gene product demonstrated that the Xenopus cells contained a 2.5-kb
      c-myc transcript and synthesized a c-myc immunoreactive 65-kd polypeptide. In
      full-grown oocytes, p65c-myc was predominantly located in the nucleus. In
      non-dividing Xenopus oocytes c-myc mRNA was present at a steady-state level 10(4)
      times higher than that of growing somatic A6 cells. This very high level of c-myc
      transcript was reached early in oogenesis and remained constant thereafter. The
      rate of p65c-myc synthesis also reached high levels, but only in vitellogenic
      oocytes, suggesting a post-transcriptional control. Although the cell cycle is
      resumed at a very fast pace in developing embryos, no further increase in total
      embryonic content of c-myc RNA could be demonstrated up to the swimming tadpole
      stage. Furthermore, in embryos the rate of synthesis of p65c-myc decreased to a
      level markedly lower than that of cell cycle-arrested vitellogenic oocytes. This 
      observation suggests that the function of the c-myc gene in the cell cycle may
      not be implicated directly in sustaining DNA synthesis or mitosis.

TI  - Xenopus myc proto-oncogene during development: expression as a stable maternal
      mRNA uncoupled from cell division.
PG  - 3563-70
AB  - A Xenopus cDNA clone highly homologous to the proto-oncogene c-myc has been
      isolated and used to derive a homologous probe to study myc expression during
      embryonic development. Myc RNA is identified as a member of the class of maternal
      mRNAs expressed before fertilisation. It is highly accumulated from early
      oogenesis and an unfertilised egg contains 8 pg, about 10(5)-fold the myc content
      of proliferative somatic cells. After fertilisation a post-transcriptional
      regulation of the gene is induced and the accumulated myc RNA is degraded (t1/2 =
      4 h 20 min) to reach a level at gastrula of 10 transcripts per cell; a value
      maintained during subsequent embryonic development. The Xenopus myc protein has
      also been identified by both myc-specific antibodies and hybrid selection
      experiments. Translation in vitro of Xenopus myc RNA shows that it encodes a
      62-kd protein which is also recognised by myc antibodies in oocyte extracts. This
      protein is accumulated in late oogenesis. The results indicate an unusual
      uncoupling of myc expression and cell proliferation linked to a stabilisation of 
      the RNA product.

TI  - Molecular characterization of a karyophilic, histone-binding protein: cDNA
      cloning, amino acid sequence and expression of nuclear protein N1/N2 of Xenopus
      laevis.
PG  - 3547-52
AB  - In the amphibian oocyte, most of the non-chromatin-bound histones are not free
      but form complexes with specific karyophilic proteins, the most prominent being
      nucleoplasmin and 'protein N1/N2'. Using antibodies against polypeptide N1 and N2
      (Mr approximately 105,000 and approximately 110,000) we have isolated, from a
      Xenopus laevis ovary lambda gt11 expression library, several full length cDNA
      clones encoding one of the two closely related polypeptides N1 and N2 (these
      could not be distinguished by hybridization techniques). The amino acid sequence 
      deduced from one of these clones (N1/N2, lambda 106.2) defines a polypeptide of
      mol. wt 64,774. The remarkably high difference between the value of Mr
      approximately 110,000 estimated from SDS-PAGE mobility and the true mol. wt has
      been found for (i) the cell protein, (ii) the polypeptide synthesized in vitro by
      transcription and translation and (iii) the fusion protein with
      beta-galactosidase expressed in Escherichia coli, indicating that the protein
      runs anomalously on SDS-PAGE. The amino and carboxy termini of the purified
      protein N1/N2 have been confirmed by direct amino acid sequencing of CNBr
      fragments. The amino acid sequence displays two glutamic acid-rich domains, which
      are probably involved in the interaction with the histones, and a putative
      nuclear targeting signal with high homology to that of the SV40 large T-antigen
      which is located near the carboxy terminus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 618-20
AB  - Antiserum prepared against a phage which infects a Chlamydia psittaci isolate
      recovered from domestic ducks was used to screen other recent avian C psittaci
      isolates by indirect immunofluorescence. Two more phage infected strains from
      ducks were discovered. However, phage was not detected in every isolate examined 
      from common source ducks, although such birds are likely to be infected with the 
      same C psittaci strain. Moreover, phage could not always be demonstrated by
      indirect immunofluorescence in McCoy cell monolayers infected with the
      phage-containing strain. The results suggest that phage infection is probably an 
      integral part of duck chlamydiosis in the United Kingdom at present, but that the
      infection is often cryptic.

TI  - [Acute abdomen in patients under anticoagulant treatment].
PG  - 1802-9
AB  - Hemorrhagic complications induced by anticoagulants occur in about 10-20% of
      patients treated. The bleeding source is found in the gastrointestinal tract in
      30%. A careful history and physical examination, in combination with radiologic
      evaluation, serve to localize the bleeding site and avoid unnecessary surgery.
      Because anticoagulated patients may have the clinical picture of acute abdomen,
      it is important to differentiate extra-, intra- and retroperitoneal
      complications. During the past ten years we have treated 16 patients with acute
      abdomen under anticoagulation therapy: extra-, intra- and retroperitoneal
      complications were found in three, nine and four cases respectively. Rectus
      sheath hematomas, intramural bowel hematomas and retroperitoneal hematomas
      primarily underwent conservative, symptomatic treatment. Only intraperitoneal
      hemorrhage and psoas hematomas with neurologic manifestations required early
      surgical treatment. After successful treatment the indication for anticoagulation
      therapy should be reevaluated.

TI  - Interpretation of endomyocardial biopsy after heart transplantation. Potentially 
      confusing factors.
PG  - 789-92
AB  - Histological examination of the myocardium by endomyocardial biopsy is a standard
      method of monitoring the presence of acute rejection in the transplanted heart.
      The histopathological consequences of the biopsy procedure itself have been
      investigated in non-transplanted hearts in the baboon. Organization of thrombus, 
      necrosis of myocytes adjacent to the biopsy site, and mononuclear cells
      (including T lymphocytes) surrounding the biopsy site appear after biopsy; should
      a subsequent biopsy be taken from this area, these appearances may be confused
      with the appearances associated with acute or resolving cardiac rejection. This
      problem has been encountered in the clinical transplant programme. Observations
      on the myocardial histopathological changes resulting from brain death and from
      parasitic infestation, both of which may also lead to confusion in the
      interpretation of endomyocardial biopsies, are also presented. Awareness of these
      factors in patients with heart transplants should lead to caution in the
      interpretation of the histopathological features and may avoid unnecessary extra 
      immunosuppression early after transplantation. Observations indicate that
      endomyocardial biopsy should not be the sole method of monitoring for the
      development of acute rejection.

TI  - Arrangement of myosin heads in relaxed thick filaments from frog skeletal muscle.
PG  - 831-51
AB  - The distribution of myosin heads on the surface of frog skeletal muscle thick
      filaments has been determined by computer processing of electron micrographs of
      isolated filaments stained with tannic acid and uranyl acetate. The heads are
      arranged in three strands but not in a strictly helical manner and so the
      structure has cylindrical symmetry. This accounts for the "forbidden" meridional 
      reflections seen in diffraction patterns. Each layer-line therefore represents
      the sum of terms of Bessel orders 0, +/- 3, +/- 6, +/- 9 and so on. These terms
      interact so that, unlike a helical object without terms from overlapping Bessel
      orders, as the azimuth is changed, the amplitude on a layer-line at a particular 
      radius varies substantially and its phase does not alter linearly. Consequently, 
      a three-dimensional reconstruction cannot be produced from a single view. We have
      therefore used tilt series of three individual filaments to decompose the data on
      layer-lines 0 to 6 into terms of Bessel orders up to +/- 9 using a least-squares 
      procedure. These data had a least-squares residual of 0.32 and enabled a
      three-dimensional reconstruction to be obtained at a nominal resolution of 6 nm. 
      This showed, at a radius of about 10 nm, three strands of projecting
      morphological units with three units spaced along each strand every 42.9 nm
      axially. We have identified these units with pairs of myosin heads. Successive
      units along a strand are perturbed axially, azimuthally and radially from the
      positions expected if the structure was perfectly helical. This may simply be a
      consequence of steric restrictions in packing the heads on the thick filament
      surface, but could also reflect an underlying non-helical arrangement of myosin
      tails, which would be consistent with the thick filament shaft being constructed 
      from three subfilaments in which the tails were arranged regularly. There was
      also material at a radius of about 6 nm spaced 42.9 nm axially, which we
      tentatively identified with accessory proteins. The filament shaft had a
      pronounced pattern of axial staining.

PG  - 1798-802
AB  - From 1976 to 1985, 27 adult invasive Haemophilus infections were observed at the 
      University Medical Center in Lausanne. Only 5 cases (19%) were caused by
      Haemophilus influenzae type b, while 12 cases (44%) were due to Haemophilus
      species other than H. influenzae. Two out of 24 strains tested were
      ampicillin-resistant. The infections were meningitis in 8, pneumonia in 7,
      endocarditis in 5, sepsis of unknown origin in 4, epiglottitis in 2, and one
      gynecological infection. Except for the latter three patients, each case was
      associated with one or more underlying conditions. Seven patients died (26%), in 
      three of whom death was directly related to the infectious process. This report
      and a review of the literature show that adult invasive Haemophilus infections
      are not uncommon and may be serious. Associated underlying diseases and advanced 
      age are generally present. In contrast to infections occurring in children,
      invasive Haemophilus infections in adults are not restricted to encapsulated
      Haemophilus influenzae type b strains.

TI  - A mutant that affects the function of autonomously replicating sequences in
      yeast.
PG  - 805-14
AB  - We previously reported the isolation of a series of mcm mutants that are
      defective in the maintenance of minichromosomes in yeast. These minichromosomes
      are circular plasmids, each containing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS)
      and a centromere. One of the mcm mutants, mcm2, has the following phenotype: at
      room temperature it affects the stability of only some minichromosomes depending 
      on the ARS present, while at high temperature it affects all minichromosomes
      tested irrespective of the ARS present. Here we show that the mcm defect as well 
      as its temperature-dependent specificity for ARSs can be demonstrated with
      circular as well as linear plasmids that do not contain centromeric sequences.
      Larger chromosomes containing multiple ARSs are also unstable in this mutant.
      Further analyses indicate that the mcm2 mutation causes the loss, rather than the
      aberrant segregation, of the circular minichromosomes. In addition, this mutation
      appears to stimulate mitotic recombination frequencies. These properties of the
      mcm2 mutant are consistent with the idea that the mcm2 mutation results in a
      defect in the initiation of DNA replication at ARSs, the putative chromosomal
      replication origins in yeast.

TI  - Organization and expression of the satellite bacteriophage P4 late gene cluster.
PG  - 793-803
AB  - The satellite bacteriophage P4 genes for capsid size determination (sid),
      transactivation (delta), and polarity suppression (psu) are cotranscribed at late
      times after infection from a single P4 late promoter (Psid) that lies to the left
      of the sid gene. While the -10 region of this promoter is similar to the
      consensus sequence for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, the -35 region shares no 
      homology with known classes of E. coli promoters. The -10 and -35 regions of Psid
      share no homology with the late gene promoters of helper phage P2. Nonetheless,
      P4 late transcription is stimulated by coinfecting P2, as well as by P2 prophage.
      This stimulation depends on the P2 encoded transcription factor ogr;
      transcription from Psid is stimulated following the induction of the P2 ogr gene 
      carried on a plasmid. P4 late transcription in the absence of P2 requires the P4 
      delta product, which is partially homologous to the P2 ogr gene product. DNA
      sequence analysis shows that the psu gene codes for a protein of Mr = 21,314 that
      is unrelated to the antitermination gene products of the lambdoid phages.

TI  - Normal yeast tRNA(CAGGln) can suppress amber codons and is encoded by an
      essential gene.
PG  - 725-35
AB  - We have isolated a gene that can encode yeast tRNA(CAGGln). When present on a
      multicopy plasmid, this gene suppresses the phenotype of a number of amber
      mutants, but has no effect on the ocher mutants tested. We therefore conclude
      that the anticodon CUG in tRNA(CAGGln) can decode the amber codon UAG by G-U
      mispairing, possibly by wobble base-pairing in the first codon position. This
      represents the second example we have observed in this laboratory of nonsense
      suppression in yeast by natural tRNA(Gln), involving G-U mispairing in the first 
      codon position. Replacing the genomic copy of the cloned gene with a disrupted
      tRNA gene results in recessive lethality in heterozygous diploids and is lethal
      to haploid cells. This lethality can be rescued by transformation of cells with a
      single copy plasmid containing the tRNA(CAGGln) gene. Thus, the gene encoding
      tRNA(CAGGln) is apparently essential for viability in yeast, suggesting that it
      is normally present as a single copy gene.

TI  - Chiral phosphorothioate analogues of B-DNA. The crystal structure of
      Rp-d[Gp(S)CpGp(S)CpGp(S)C].
PG  - 891-905
AB  - The compound Rp-d[Gp(S)CpGp(S)CpGp(S)C], an analogue of the deoxyoligomer
      d(G-C)3, crystallizes in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 34.90 A, b = 39.15 A 
      and c = 20.64 A. The structure, which is not isomorphous with any previously
      determined deoxyoligonucleotide, was refined to an R factor of 14.5% at a
      resolution of 2.17 A, with 72 solvent molecules located. The two strands of the
      asymmetric unit form a right-handed double helix, which is a new example of a
      B-DNA conformation and brings to light an important and overlooked component of
      flexibility of the double helix. This flexibility is manifest in the alternation 
      of the backbone conformation between two states, defined by the adjacent torsion 
      angles epsilon and zeta, trans . gauche-(BI) and gauche-. trans (BII). BI is
      characteristic of classical of B-DNA and has an average C(1') to C(1') separation
      of 4.5 A. The corresponding separation for BII is 5.3 A. Each state is associated
      with a distinct phosphate orientation where the plane of the PO2 (or POS) group
      is alternately near horizontal or vertical with respect to the helix axis. The BI
      and BII conformations are out of phase on the two strands. As a consequence, on
      one strand purine-pyrimidine stacking is better than pyrimidine-purine, while the
      converse holds for the other strand. At each base-pair step, good and bad
      stacking alternate across the helix axis. The pattern of alternation is regular
      in the context of a fundamental dinucleotide repeat. Re-examination of the B-DNA 
      dodecamer d(C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G) shows that the C-G-C-G regions contain the
      BI and BII conformations, and the associated dual phosphate orientation and
      asymmetric base stacking. Different mechanisms are used in the two structures to 
      avoid clashes between guanine residues on opposite strands, a combination of
      lateral slide, tilt and helical twist in the present structure, and base roll,
      tilt and longitudinal slide (Calladine rules) in the dodecamer. The flexibility
      of the phosphate orientations demonstrated in this structure is important, since 
      it offers a structural basis for protein-nucleic acid recognition.

TI  - Requirements for the formation of plasmid-transducing particles of Bacillus
      subtilis bacteriophage SPP1.
PG  - 3723-8
AB  - We had previously proposed that the production of concatemeric plasmid DNA in
      plasmid-transducing SPP1 particles is a consequence of phage-directed
      rolling-circle-type replication of plasmid DNA. The production of such DNA was
      greatly enhanced when DNA/DNA homology was provided between phage and plasmid
      DNAs (facilitation of transduction). Here we present evidence that synthesis of
      concatemeric plasmid DNA can proceed after phage infection under conditions
      non-permissive for plasmid replication. We also propose that the naturally
      occurring homology between plasmid and phage is sufficient to account for the
      frequency of transduction observed in the absence of facilitating homology.
      Homology of greater than 47 bp gives the maximal facilitation of plasmid
      transduction. Recombination is not an essential part in the synthesis of
      concatemeric plasmid DNA.

TI  - E. coli ribosomes with a C912 to U base change in the 16S rRNA are streptomycin
      resistant.
PG  - 3705-8
AB  - Resistance to streptomycin (Sm) of Euglena gracilis chloroplasts can be due to a 
      single C to T transition of the 16S rRNA gene in an invariant position which is
      equivalent to C912 of the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA. Since Euglena chloroplasts
      cannot be transformed we introduced, by site-directed mutagenesis, a C912 to T
      transition in the cloned rrnB operon (pKK3535) of E. coli and used this new
      construct (pEM109) in transformation experiments. Transformed E. coli cells were 
      selected for Sm resistance by colony plating and stepwise increase of Sm up to 25
      micrograms/ml of culture medium. Several Sm-resistant colonies were obtained.
      Ribosomes were isolated from pEM109-transformed Sm-resistant and
      pKK3535-transformed Sm-sensitive cells. The ribosomes were assayed in vitro for
      Sm-induced misreading of poly(U) mRNA. We isolated 16S rRNA and sequenced the
      crucial RNA region by reverse transcription. The results clearly show that
      ribosomes from Sm-resistant cells correctly read the poly(U) mRNA in the presence
      of 25 micrograms Sm/ml of reaction mixture and the 16S rRNA contains the C912 to 
      U transition. We conclude that C912 is involved in a translation step(s) which is
      (are) sensitive to streptomycin.

TI  - Two Drosophila chorion genes terminate transcription in discrete regions near
      their poly(A) sites.
PG  - 3591-6
AB  - We have examined transcription termination of two closely linked Drosophila
      melanogaster chorion genes, s36-1 and s38-1, using the electron microscope. Our
      method is unusual and is independent of in vitro nuclear run-on transcription. By
      measuring transcription unit lengths in chromatin spreads, we can localize
      efficient termination sites to a region of approximately 210 bp for s36-1 and
      approximately 365 bp for s38-1. The center of this region is approximately 105
      nucleotides downstream of the poly(A) site for the s36-1 gene, and approximately 
      400 nucleotides downstream for the s38-1 gene. Thus, these two Drosophila chorion
      genes terminate more closely to their poly(A) addition sites and in a shorter
      region than many other polyadenylated genes examined to date.

PG  - 3531-7
AB  - We describe a chemical investigation of the nucleosome binding site(s) on histone
      H5. Selective radiolabelling by reductive methylation has led to the
      identification of lysine residues in H5 that are protected by its association
      with chromatin. The most strongly protected lysine is Lys-85 which occurs in the 
      globular domain, in a region that is highly conserved between H5 and H1, and in
      H1 variants, and which probably constitutes a strong binding site for DNA where
      it enters and leaves the nucleosome. Lysines in the amino-terminal and
      lysine-rich carboxy-terminal tails are only weakly protected against chemical
      modification, suggesting a different mode of interaction with DNA.

TI  - Alternative splicing and alternative initiation of translation explain the four
      forms of the Ia antigen-associated invariant chain.
PG  - 3483-8
AB  - The Ia antigen-associated invariant chain (In) exists in humans as four related
      polypeptides, p33, p35, p41 and p43, all associated with HLA-class II antigens.
      As described previously, two of these forms of In chain, p33 and p35, result from
      the use of two in-phase initiation AUG codons on the unique In p33 mRNA. In
      addition to cDNA clones derived from In p33 mRNA, we have isolated a new cDNA
      clone, called p41-1, which differs from p33-1 by an additional segment in the
      coding region. The DNA sequence encoding the segment unique to p41-1 was
      identified in the genomic sequence in the intron between exon 6 and 7, and we
      refer to it as exon 6b. Cells transfected with a full length p41 cDNA clone in an
      expression vector synthesize the two larger forms of the In chain, p41 and p43.
      We propose that the larger mRNA, encoding p41, results from alternative splicing 
      of exon 6b, and that p41 and p43 result from the use of the two functional
      initiation AUG codons identified in p33 mRNA. Alternative splicing, together with
      alternative initiation of translation, allows therefore the synthesis of four
      related In chain polypeptides from a single gene.

TI  - Medical students' beliefs about nine different specialties.
PG  - 1607-10
AB  - A total of 449 preclinical and postclinical students from three London University
      medical schools completed one of nine versions of a 50 item questionnaire seeking
      their attitudes to nine specialties: anaesthetics, general practice, gynaecology,
      hospital medicine, paediatrics, pathology, psychiatry, radiology, and surgery.
      There were three main findings. Firstly, though item by item analysis yielded
      interesting and predictable differences, such as the negative attitudes to
      psychiatry, the students' attitudes and beliefs were multidimensional: whereas
      any specialty might be seen as highly positive on one dimension--for example,
      effectiveness--it might be seen as highly negative on another--for example,
      relationships with patients. Secondly, the nine specialties seemed to be
      discriminative on two dimensions--soft versus hard; general versus specific--such
      that psychiatry was seen as soft and specific, general practice soft and general,
      and surgery hard but neither general nor specific. Thirdly, these attitudes
      tended to differ between preclinical and clinical students, but only modestly, in
      that some extreme (positive and negative) attitudes were modified by experience.

TI  - Effects of luteinising hormone on embryo production in superovulated cows.
PG  - 625-6
AB  - Equivalent doses of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) produced the same number
      of embryos and ova from a single flush irrespective of the luteinising hormone
      (LH) content of the superovulating drug (P less than 0.108). As the LH content of
      the FSH increased, the proportion of transferable embryos decreased (P less than 
      0.001) because the proportion fertilised decreased (P less than 0.001) and the
      degeneration rate of the fertilised embryos increased (P less than 0.002). FSH-W 
      free from detectable luteinising hormone produced 8.8 embryos per flush of which 
      5.7 were transferable, representing 7.6 fertilised embryos of which 21 per cent
      had degenerated. The addition of a very small quantity of LH (FSH/LH ratio more
      than 500) resulted in 5.8 transferable embryos from a total of 10.6, of which 9.0
      had been fertilised and 34 per cent of those fertilised had degenerated.
      Commercial FSH-P (FSH/LH less than 100) produced 3.3 transferable embryos from a 
      total of 8.1, of which six had been fertilised and 39 per cent of those
      fertilised had degenerated. The luteinising hormone content of FSH-P has to be
      controlled and limited for optimum superovulation in cattle.

TI  - [Perspectives in the clinical application of pancreas transplantation in the
      diabetic].
PG  - 822-6
AB  - Until June 1983 a total of 280 human pancreatic transplantations had been
      performed world-wide. Until July 1983, 57 were functioning (22%), 11% for more
      than 12 months. During the past 5 years a steady increase in the number of
      segmental transplants has been observed. In most cases simultaneous
      transplantation of pancreas and kidney was performed (144 cases), in 65 cases the
      pancreas was transplanted metachronously after kidney grafting, and in 64 cases
      pancreatic transplantation was performed alone. Currently, segmental or whole
      pancreatic transplantation is the favoured procedure. Islet transplantation has
      been disappointing because of the difficulty in procuring sufficient numbers of
      islets from an adult pancreas followed by immunological destruction of the
      transplanted islets. Most pancreas grafts have been procured from cadavers, but
      the favoured segmental technique allows living related donors to be used. After
      rejection the graft does not always have to be removed and exogenous insulin
      administration may be resumed, either permanently or until re-transplantation can
      be accomplished. Life-long immunosuppression is needed after transplantation and 
      currently pancreatic allograft survival rates for cyclosporin (CSA) and
      azathioprine-treated patients have been similar. The longest survival of a living
      diabetic recipient with a functioning pancreas is 5 1/2 years. Some authors have 
      recently claimed improvement and stabilization of impaired nerve conduction and
      diabetic retinopathy after pancreatic transplantation.

TI  - The conventional versus the new radiological contrast media. Cost-benefit
      analysis and medicolegal implications.
PG  - 799-801
AB  - New iodinated radiological contrast media, which are safer but much more
      expensive than the conventional ones, have been introduced. Since the financial
      implications are considerable a compromise between cost and safety is inevitable.
      It is therefore recommended that, at present, the conventional media be used
      routinely and the new media be reserved for potentially painful examinations and 
      for patients at higher risk. Should a question of wrongfulness or negligence
      concerning the use of contrast media be considered by our courts, they will
      undoubtedly be influenced by what is considered 'common practice' and 'accepted
      practice' within a medical specialty and that may be co-determined by
      socio-economic considerations.

      of the 74 amino acid residues as well as the labile protons which exchange
      sufficiently slowly to be observed in H2O solution. The proton chemical shifts
      are listed at 50 degrees C and pH 3.2, which coincides with the conditions used
      for the determination of the three-dimensional structure of Tendamistat.

TI  - Phage T1-mediated transduction of a plasmid containing the T1 pac site.
PG  - 681-92
AB  - The T1 pac site has been cloned into a plasmid vector. This recombinant plasmid
      was tested for T1-mediated transduction efficiency in comparison with a plasmid
      containing the phage lambda T1-pac-like site esp-lambda, plasmids containing T1
      sequences other than the pac site, and plasmids containing neither T1 sequences
      nor known pac sites. The data obtained indicate that there are at least two
      distinct mechanisms of T1-mediated plasmid transduction. One requires the
      presence of any T1 sequence on the plasmid and probably takes place via
      cointegrate formation with the homologous region of an infecting T1 genome. The
      other is specifically dependent on the presence of a pac site on the plasmid.
      Plasmids are packaged as head-to-tail multimers that have one heterogeneous
      molecular end and the other terminated at pac, and the direction of packaging
      with respect to the pac site is the same for plasmids as for T1. Possible roles
      of pac in plasmid packaging and their implications with regard to the packaging
      of phage DNA are discussed.

TI  - Inducible cephalosporinase production in clinical isolates of Enterobacter
      cloacae is controlled by a regulatory gene that has been deleted from Escherichia
      coli.
PG  - 3709-14
AB  - Cephalosporin hyper-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strains are isolated with
      increasing frequency from hospital infections. Resistance is principally due to
      the chromosomal ampC gene encoding a cephalosporinase. In contrast to Escherichia
      coli which expresses ampC constitutively from a promoter located in the upstream 
      frdD gene, E. cloacae displays inducible ampC expression. By cloning the ampC
      gene it was shown that a linked genetic locus, ampR, mediated the induction by
      beta-lactams. In the absence of the antibiotic the 30,500 dalton AmpR protein
      represses ampC expression. The ampR gene shows a highly compact arrangement and
      is situated between the divergently expressed ampC gene and the frd operon from
      which it is separated by a bifunctional transcription terminator. The promoters
      for ampR and ampC substantially overlap and mRNA analyses showed that on
      induction transcription from the ampC promoter increased greatly whereas that
      from ampR did not. Two regions of sequence homology flank the ampR gene and it is
      proposed that a homologous recombination event between these in an ancestral
      enteric bacterium may have led to the deletion of ampR from the E. coli genome.

AB  - Hybrids between plasmids pC194, pBR322 and the bacteriophage f1 undergo deletions
      in Escherichia coli. The deletions end most often between nucleotides 1445 and

      of this plasmid. The localization of the other deletion end appears to be
      determined by the position of the f1 replication fork. Two models accounting for 
      these data are discussed.

TI  - Transposition of mini-Mu containing only one of the ends of bacteriophage Mu.
PG  - 3687-90
AB  - Transposition of mini-Mu containing only one of the ends of bacteriophage Mu was 
      studied. Transposition was observed when plasmids containing this mini-Mu were
      used as the donor in a mating-out assay with the F factor POX38, which lacks all 
      known transposable elements, as the target. Analysis of the plasmids isolated
      from the recipient strain showed that in most cases the mini-Mu containing
      plasmid and POX38 were fused and that a part of the plasmid had been duplicated, 
      indicating the formation of co-integrates. To obtain the DNA sequences of the
      junctions between donor and recipient DNA, an F factor was constructed that made 
      it possible to analyse these junctions directly. The results showed that several 
      sequences can be used as an alternative end in transposition and that these
      alternative ends show homology with the consensus for a strong A binding site.
      Moreover, the first base pair at the junction was always a (TA) base pair. This
      base pair is situated at exactly the same position with respect to the sequence
      which has homology with the consensus for a strong A binding site as in the ends 
      of Mu.

TI  - At least two nuclear gene products are specifically required for translation of a
      single yeast mitochondrial mRNA.
PG  - 3637-41
AB  - Mitochondrial translation of the oxi2 mRNA, encoding yeast cytochrome c oxidase
      subunit III (coxIII), has previously been shown to specifically require the
      mitochondrially located protein product of the nuclear gene PET494. We show here 
      that this specific translational activation involves at least one other newly
      identified gene termed PET54. Mutations in PET54 cause an absence of the coxIII
      protein despite the presence of normal levels of its mRNA. pet494 mutations are
      known to be suppressible by mitochondrial gene rearrangements that replace the
      normal 5'-untranslated leader of the oxi2 mRNA with the leaders of other
      mitochondrial mRNAs. In this study we show that pet54, pet494 double mutants are 
      suppressed by the same mitochondrial gene rearrangements, showing that the PET54 
      product is specifically required, in addition to the PET494 protein, for
      translation of the oxi2 mRNA. Since, as we show here, PET54 is not an activator
      of PET494 gene expression, our results suggest that the products of both of these
      genes may act together to stimulate coxIII translation.

TI  - The sex-determining gene tra of Drosophila: molecular cloning and transformation 
      studies.
PG  - 3607-13
AB  - In Drosophila, the primary signal for sex determination is given by the ratio of 
      X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X:A). The primary signal is read by a key
      gene (Sxl) and transmitted down to the differentiation genes by the subordinate
      control genes tra, tra-2, ix and dsx. Mutations in tra transform chromosomal
      females (X/X; tra/tra) into sterile males (pseudomales). We have cloned the tra
      region by microdissection and chromosomal walking. We identified the gene using
      deficiency breakpoints, DNA aberrations in three different alleles of tra and by 
      P-mediated transformation. A 3.8-kb fragment perfectly rescued the mutant
      phenotype of X/X; tra/tra flies, showing that it contained all the necessary
      information to restore female-specific functions in the mutant flies. We present 
      evidence that most of the function of tra can be provided by a subsegment of 2 kb
      that is differentially transcribed or processed in males and females.

TI  - The first exon of the c-myc proto-oncogene contains a novel positive control
      element.
PG  - 3553-62
AB  - We have identified a positive modulator within the c-myc first exon downstream of
      the gene's transcription initiation sites, P1 and P2. We introduced myc-CAT
      (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) hybrid genes into three cell lines (BJAB, COS
      and HeLa) and measured their expression by either CAT enzymatic activity, S1
      nuclease protection or by a nuclear 'run-on' transcription assay. Removal of 46
      bp from the 3' end of the first exon results in a decrease of myc-CAT expression 
      and P2 activity. A 438-bp exon 1 segment, lacking the normal myc promoters,
      efficiently drives the expression of SV40 early promoters. We find that this
      first exon segment efficiently functions as a positive modulator only in its
      sense orientation, 3' of a nearby promoter. The positive effects of the myc first
      exon and the SV40 enhancer are complementary.

TI  - Sites hypersensitive to, and protected from, nuclease digestion in the regulatory
      region of wild-type and mutant polyoma chromatin.
PG  - 3539-46
AB  - It has been shown that the untranscribed regulatory region of polyoma virus (Py) 
      is hypersensitive (Hs) to DNase I treatment, and that this hypersensitivity is
      located in two areas which correspond to the A and B domains of the enhancer. We 
      mapped the DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Py regulatory region of wild-type 
      (PyA2) and of mutants, selected in neuroblastoma cells (PyNB), which are
      characterized by an extensive duplication involving the A domain, with or without
      deletion of the B domain. The experiments were performed in both a permissive
      host (3T6 mouse fibroblasts) and in a restrictive host (41A3 mouse neuroblasts). 
      No significant differences were observed between the two hosts. Our results show 
      that four sites, in addition to the ones already described, can be identified in 
      the wild-type A2 strain. These newly identified sites coincide with the domains
      of the enhancer region as they have recently been established. In PyNB mutants
      duplications and deletions are generally correlated to the gain or loss of the
      corresponding hypersensitive sites. However, a new site is formed in one of the
      duplicated sequences, even if no corresponding hypersensitive site is present in 
      the other identical sequence. A region protected from DNase I digestion occurs in
      the PyNB mutants which corresponds to the junction of the duplication which is
      absent in the wild-type strain. In this region, as a consequence of the
      rearrangement, a GGCGGG motif which is very similar to the one (GGGCGG) present
      at the binding sites of the cellular regulatory protein SP1, is found.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Involvement of finger domain and kringle 2 domain of tissue-type plasminogen
      activator in fibrin binding and stimulation of activity by fibrin.
PG  - 3525-30
AB  - Human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) catalyses the conversion of
      inactive plasminogen into active plasmin, the main fibrinolytic enzyme. This
      process is confined to the fibrin surface by specific binding of t-PA to fibrin
      and stimulation of its activity by fibrin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator
      contains five domains designated finger, growth factor, kringle 1, kringle 2 and 
      protease. The involvement of the domains in fibrin specificity was investigated
      with a set of variant proteins lacking one or more domains. Variant proteins were
      produced by expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells of plasmids containing part
      of the coding sequence for the activator. It was found that kringle 2 domain only
      is involved in stimulation of activity by fibrin. In the absence of plasminogen
      and at low concentration of fibrin, binding of t-PA is mainly due to the finger
      domain, while at high fibrin concentrations also kringle 2 is involved in fibrin 
      binding. In the presence of plasminogen, fibrin binding of the kringle 2 region
      of t-PA also becomes important at low fibrin concentrations.

TI  - The complete sequence and structural analysis of human apolipoprotein B-100:
      relationship between apoB-100 and apoB-48 forms.
PG  - 3495-507
AB  - We have isolated and sequenced overlapping cDNA clones covering the entire
      sequence of human apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). DNA sequence analysis and
      determination of the mRNA transcription initiation site by S1 nuclease mapping
      showed that the apoB mRNA consists of 14,112 nucleotides including the 5' and 3' 
      untranslated regions which are 128 and 301 nucleotides respectively. The
      DNA-derived protein sequence shows that apoB-100 is 513,000 daltons and contains 
      4560 amino acids including a 24-amino-acid-long signal peptide. The mol. wt of
      apoB-100 implies that there is one apoB molecule per LDL particle. Computer
      analysis of the predicted secondary structure of the protein showed that some of 
      the potential alpha helical and beta sheet structures are amphipathic, whereas
      others have non-amphipathic neutral to apolar character. These latter regions may
      contribute to the formation of the lipid-binding domains of apoB-100. The protein
      contains 25 cysteines and 20 potential N-glycosylation sites. The majority of
      cysteines are distributed in the amino terminal portion of the protein. Four of
      the potential glycosylation sites are in predicted beta turn structures and may
      represent true glycosylation positions. ApoB lacks the tandem repeats which are
      characteristic of other apolipoproteins. The mean hydrophobicity the mean value
      of H1 and helical hydrophobic moment the mean value of microH profiles of apoB
      showed the presence of several potential helical regions with strong polar
      character and high hydrophobic moment. The region with the highest hydrophobic
      moment, between amino acid residues 3352 and 3369, contains five closely spaced, 
      positively charged residues, and has sequence homology to the LDL receptor
      binding site of apoE. This region is flanked by three neighbouring regions with
      positively charged amino acids and high hydrophobic moment that are located
      between residues 3174 and 3681. One or more of these closely spaced apoB
      sequences may be involved in the formation of the LDL receptor-binding domain of 
      apoB-100. Blotting analysis of intestinal RNA and hybridization of the blots with
      carboxy apoB cDNA probes produced a single 15-kb hybridization band whereas
      hybridization with amino terminal probes produced two hybridization bands of 15
      and 8 kb. Our data indicate that both forms of apoB mRNA contain common sequences
      which extend from the amino terminal of apoB-100 to the vicinity of nucleotide
      residue 6300. These two messages may have resulted from differential splicing of 
      the same primary apoB mRNA transcript.

TI  - Rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in human T leukaemic cells
      shows preferential utilization of the D segment (DQ52) nearest to the J region.
PG  - 3467-73
AB  - The DNA rearrangements leading to the assembly of genes coding for the
      immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in B cells and the T cell receptor for antigen
      in T cells are not completely lineage specific. This probably reflects the use of
      a common recombinase by IgH and the T cell receptor. This paper describes novel
      observations on the nature of these cross-lineage rearrangements. A high
      proportion (though not all) IgH rearrangements in human T leukaemic cells involve
      the D segment nearest to the J region (DQ52). This same D segment is not involved
      in B cell IgH rearrangements with one important exception, namely a proportion of
      B cell leukaemic clones with the most primitive B cell precursor phenotype. These
      observations have potentially important implications for early lymphoid cell
      differentiation and in particular support the idea that the 3' D plus J region
      might lie within a limited window of accessibility of the IgH gene in precursor
      lymphocytes.

TI  - Regulation of protein kinase activities in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells.
PG  - 3441-7
AB  - Stimulation of serine protein kinase activity (referred to as S6 kinase) occurs
      within minutes of addition of nerve growth factor (NGF) to PC12 rat
      pheochromocytoma cells. This enzyme activity is not related to the cAMP-dependent
      protein kinase (protein kinase A) or the Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein
      kinase (protein kinase C), two other protein kinases potentially involved in
      signal transduction. Two peaks of NGF-stimulated S6 phosphotransferase activity
      are observed upon ion exchange chromatography; one that comigrates with the
      serine kinase previously described in chicken embryo fibroblasts and another with
      distinct elution properties. Several other factors are also found to regulate S6 
      phosphotransferase activity in PC12 cells including epidermal growth factor,
      insulin, and phorbol myristate acetate. Dibutyryl cAMP stimulates S6
      phosphotransferase activity; however, this activity is strongly inhibited by the 
      protein kinase A heat stable inhibitor. At least two mechanisms exist through
      which the NGF-stimulated S6 kinase activity can be regulated, one that apparently
      can use protein kinase C whereas the other(s) does not. The potential roles of
      these protein kinase activities in signal transduction and regulation of cell
      growth and differentiation is discussed.

TI  - Reconstitution of the fusogenic activity of vesicular stomatitis virus.
PG  - 3429-35
AB  - Enveloped virus glycoproteins exhibit membrane fusion activity. We have analysed 
      whether the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, reconstituted into
      liposomes, is able to fuse nucleated cells in a pH-dependent fashion.
      Proteoliposomes produced by octylglucoside dialysis did not exhibit cell fusion
      activity of the G protein. However, by making use of n-dodecyl octaethylene
      monoether (C12E8) as the solubilizing agent and by removal of the detergent in
      two steps, we were able to produce fusogenic G protein liposomes. These G protein
      liposomes fuse to the BHK-21 cell surface at pH 5.7-6.0 with an efficiency of
      fusion comparable with that of the parent virus. Physical and chemical analysis
      revealed that the fusogenic liposomes exhibited a protein to lipid weight ratio
      of 0.67 and showed an average diameter of 130 nm.

TI  - [Surgical treatment of hepatoma on a cirrhotic liver].
PG  - 2235-8
AB  - From January 1, 1975 to July 1, 1984, 37 patients with a tentative diagnosis of
      hepatocarcinoma on cirrhosis were operated upon. There were 34 men and 3 women,
      aged from 32 to 82 years (mean: 60 years). The diagnosis of cirrhosis rested
      either on a history of liver failure associated with clinical and biochemical
      signs of hepatocellular dysfunction (4 cases), or on a positive liver biopsy (5
      cases). In 20 cases the diagnosis was suspected on account of abnormal liver
      function tests, but in 8 patients it was revealed by macroscopic examination of
      the liver during surgery. Cirrhosis was attributed to chronic alcoholism in 25
      cases, haemochromatosis in 11 cases and positive HBs antigen in 7 cases. The
      diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma, suggested by altered general condition or recent
      pain, rested on the finding of a tumoral image at scintigraphy (16 cases),
      ultrasonography (19 cases), computed tomography (7 cases), arteriography (17
      cases) or laparoscopy (7 cases). In only 7/32 patients was the alpha-foetoprotein
      level higher than 500 ng/l. Surgery confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma in
      every case but that of cirrhosis in only 14/37 cases; 10 patients had lesion of
      hepatic fibrosis and 1 had regenerative nodular hyperplasia. In 10 cases no
      accurate histological diagnosis could be made since the liver tissue sample had
      been taken too close to the tumour. The finding of normal liver tissue shows that
      one should not refrain from operating merely because the diagnosis of cirrhosis
      rests on clinical grounds. Since 1979, surgical treatment consists in an attempt 
      to excise the tumour. Per-operative mortality is the same with excision surgery
      (21%) as with exploratory or palliative surgery (17%). Fourteen excisions were
      performed (i.e. aresectability rate of 38% for the series): 2 liver
      transplantations, 2 right hepatectomies, 2 left hepatectomies, 2 left
      lobectomies, 2 bisegmentectomies and 3 tumorectomies. The survival rate of 2
      years was 27%, as opposed to 5% with exploratory or palliative surgery.
      Systematic monitoring of cirrhosis with ultrasonography should result in early
      diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma at a stage where limited hepatic excision is
      possible and the chances of surviving are highest.

      metastases, were studied. Only patients whose general condition was considered
      good enough to tolerate intensive combination chemotherapy were included in this 
      study. The median survival time of these patients was 33 weeks (range 7-192
      weeks) with a mean survival time of 43 weeks. Patients who responded with
      objective tumour improvement within 6 weeks had a median survival time of 39
      weeks. Those showing disease stabilization at 6 weeks had a median survival time 
      of 35 weeks while those having disease progression at this time had a median
      survival of 22 weeks. Patients without liver involvement and a normal serum
      albumin level at the start of treatment had statistically superior survival
      times.

TI  - Pig platelet tropomyosin: interactions with the other thin-filament proteins.
PG  - 815-30
AB  - Pig platelet tropomyosin exhibits many of the functional activities of skeletal
      tropomyosin. At low ionic strength it forms end-to-end aggregates similar to
      those formed by skeletal tropomyosins. It forms a 1:1 complex with muscle
      troponin or with a troponin I-pig brain calmodulin complex, as well as a 1:6
      association with platelet filamentous actin. Electron microscopy of paracrystals 
      shows that the troponin binding site is slightly C-terminal of the unique
      cysteine, corresponding to position 190 of the rabbit skeletal alpha-tropomyosin 
      sequence. The effect of a complex comprising platelet actin and tropomyosin on
      the ATPase activity of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1 was similar to
      that displayed by its skeletal muscle counterpart. Platelet tropomyosin decreased
      the activity by roughly half in a calcium-independent manner. Addition of
      troponin to the actin-tropomyosin in the absence of calcium results in further
      inhibition and allows the full activity of the complex to be restored by Ca2+.
      These results differ from those obtained by Cote & Smillie for horse platelet
      tropomyosin and this may reflect the different isomeric nature of pig platelet
      tropomyosin. These results suggest that the functional properties of non-muscle
      tropomyosins may differ when comparisons are made between proteins isolated from 
      the same type of cell but in different species. Differences in self-association
      and actin-binding properties may be finely graded between different isoforms.

TI  - Structures of mismatched base pairs in DNA and their recognition by the
      Escherichia coli mismatch repair system.
PG  - 3697-703
AB  - The Escherichia coli mismatch repair system does not recognize and/or repair all 
      mismatched base pairs with equal efficiency: whereas transition mismatches (G X T
      and A X C) are well repaired, the repair of some transversion mismatches (e.g. A 
      X G or C X T) appears to depend on their position in heteroduplex DNA of phage
      lambda. Undecamers were synthesized and annealed to form heteroduplexes with a
      single base-pair mismatch in the centre and with the five base pairs flanking
      each side corresponding to either repaired or unrepaired heteroduplexes of lambda
      DNA. Nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) studies show that a G X A mismatch gives
      rise to an equilibrium between fully helical and a looped-out structure. In the
      unrepaired G X A mismatch duplex the latter predominates, while the helical
      structure is predominant in the case of repaired G X A and G X T mismatches. It
      appears that the E. coli mismatch repair enzymes recognize and repair
      intrahelical mismatched bases, but not the extrahelical bases in the looped-out
      structures.

      2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (m3G) and 6-methyladenosine (m6A) for differential
      immune affinity chromatography of the snRNPs. While anti-m3G affinity columns
      allow the separation of snRNPs U1, U2 and U5 from U4/U6 RNPs, anti-m6A antibodies
      selectively react with snRNPs U2 and U4/U6. Our technique further incorporates
      immune affinity chromatography of snRNPs with antibodies against snRNP proteins
      in addition to ion exchange chromatography. The procedure avoids the usage of
      denaturing agents, so as to maintain the native structure of the particles. This 
      is mainly provided for by the possibility of eluting the anti-m3G and anti-m6A
      bound snRNPs with excess of the respective nucleosides. We have so far identified
      12 polypeptides as constituents of the major snRNPs U1 to U6. Seven proteins of
      approximate mol. wts 29 kd (B'), 28 kd (B), 16 kd (D), 15.5 kd (D'), 12 kd (E),
      11 kd (F) and 9 kd (G) were present in each of the individual snRNPs U1, U2, U5
      and U4/U6. In addition to the common proteins, U1 RNPs contain three unique
      polypeptides of mol. wts 70 kd, 34 kd (A) and 22 kd (C). U2 RNPs are
      characterized by the presence of a 33-kd and a 28.5-kd protein, denoted A' and
      B". We could not detect any unique polypeptide confined to the purified snRNPs U5
      or U4/U6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Functionally distinct serine phosphorylation sites of p36, the cellular substrate
      of retroviral protein kinase; differential inhibition of reassociation with p11.
PG  - 3455-60
AB  - P36 was originally defined as the major cytoplasmic target of retrovirally coded 
      tyrosine-kinases. While recently much has been learned about its biochemistry,
      the functional importance of its tyrosine and serine phosphorylation has not been
      approached. As p36 is now understood as a multi-ligand protein its in vitro
      phosphorylation by three different serine/threonine kinases was followed.
      Monomeric p36 is a much better substrate than the complex containing two copies
      each of p36 and p11 (protein I). All p36 phosphorylation sites occur within the
      amino-terminal 29 residues specifically released by mild proteolysis. As this
      region harbors an important interaction site for p11 the reduced phosphorylation 
      of p36 in the protein I complex results most likely from a lowered accessibility.
      Phosphorylation of p36 is serine specific. Reconstitution experiments define at
      least two functionally distinct sites. One product of protein kinase C
      reconstitutes with p11 to protein I, while this complex formation normal for p36 
      is observed neither for the second phosphorylation product nor for the
      derivatives resulting from phosphorylation by calmodulin or cAMP dependent
      kinases. The results lend direct support to the hypothesis that phosphorylation
      of p36 can modulate one of its molecular functions. Obvious implications for
      other Ca2+-dependent lipid binding proteins are discussed.

AB  - In this study, the possible effects of piperacillin on three immune functions of 
      human blood monocytes-macrophages were investigated. Monocytes and macrophages
      were isolated from the circulating blood of normal subjects by density gradient
      centrifugation followed by adhesion to plastic material. The cells were incubated
      for 30 to 60 min with different concentrations of piperacillin, then tested on
      the following models: presentation by the monocytes-macrophages of an exogenous
      antigen to autologous lymphoid cells, with evaluation of the proliferative
      response to tuberculin; secretion of interleukin-1 by monocytes-macrophages
      stimulated or not by lipopolysaccharide, with measurement of the culture
      supernatants ability to stimulate rat thymocytes; release to prostaglandin E2 by 
      monocytes-macrophages with evaluation of its indomethacin-inhibitable suppressive
      effect on lymphoproliferative responses to a polyclonal mitogen. In none of these
      tests did piperacillin show and immunodepressant or immunostimulant effect.

PG  - 2362-7
AB  - A synergistic effect of antibacterial activity has been demonstrated with
      piperacillin combined with an aminoglycoside. Four groups of 30 female Wistar
      rats were injected daily for 14 days with either gentamicin 50 mg/kg, or
      piperacillin 1,000 mg/kg, or both drugs combined; the control group received
      sodium chloride in solution. In all groups, creatinine clearance, lysosomal
      structural latency and renal cortex enzyme activities (alanine-aminopeptidase,
      N-acetyl beta D-glucosaminidase, sphingomyelinase, cathepsin B) were measured on 
      days 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 of treatment. Renal cortex concentrations of gentamicin
      were measured in the group that received gentamicin alone and in the group
      treated with both piperacillin and gentamicin. The renal functional changes
      usually induced by aminoglycosides were observed. Piperacillin administered alone
      reduced creatinine clearance and alanine-aminopeptidase activity. The
      piperacillin-gentamicin combination proved unable to prevent the fall in
      creatinine clearance; it also reduced the alanine-aminopeptidase,
      sphingomyelinase and cathepsin B activities, but the reduction was less
      pronounced than that induced by gentamicin alone.

PG  - 2358-61
AB  - The mechanism of neutropenia induced by beta-lactam antibiotics was explored by
      studying the action of these drugs on granulopoiesis in vitro. Normal bone
      marrows were cultivated in the presence of increasing concentrations of
      piperacillin (10 marrows), mezlocillin, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (5 marrows
      each) in order to find out whether these antibiotics exhibited toxicity to
      granulocyte-monocyte precursors. A dose-dependent inhibition of granulopoiesis
      was found in all cases. When the doses used were equivalent to maximum plasma
      concentrations in vivo, inhibition was minimal with piperacillin and mezlocillin 
      and much more pronounced with the cephalosporins. This dose-dependent inhibition 
      suggests that toxicity is involved in the mechanism of neutropenia induced by
      beta-lactam antibiotics.

      and amikacin combination].
PG  - 2353-7
AB  - Two hundred and fifty patients (mean age 39 years) were involved in a
      multicentric pilot trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a piperacillin 
      (P) + amikacin (A) combination in severe neutropenic patients (less than 500
      PNN/microliters). In patients who failed to improve under this combination
      vancomycin (V) was added. Two hundred and thirty-five patients were assessable
      for response to P + A. The infection was microbiologically undocumented in 148 of
      them (63%) and documented in 87 (37%). Response rates were 64% and 53%
      respectively, rising to 73% in both groups after addition of vancomycin. Thirty
      p. 100 of the patients had bacteremia. The most frequently encountered pathogens 
      were staphylococci, enterobacteria, streptococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
      Sixty-six p. 100 of gram-negative and staphylococcal infections responded to the 
      P + A combination, while the response rate of staphylococcal infections was 23%. 
      Fifty-seven p. 100 of staphylococci resistant to P + A were controlled by P + A +
      V. Fifteen (6.4%) patients died of infection, 5 of them of fungal infection.
      Toxicity was mild, with 3% renal toxicity. The P + A combination is effective as 
      first line therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. These results and
      epidemiological data suggest that this combination plus vancomycin would be a
      suitable second line therapy for patients who did not improve.

AB  - In a French multicentric trial the effectiveness and safety of piperacillin were 
      evaluated in 333 patients with severe infections. Piperacillin was administered
      alone in 212 cases. The overall results show that the drug was clinically
      effective in 85% of the patients. The results of this French study are similar to
      those of other studies previously published. They demonstrate an increase in the 
      number of failures against ampicillin-resistant and carbenicillin-resistant
      strains, even when these strains were sensitive to piperacillin in vitro.
      Piperacillin was tolerated as well as the other beta-lactam antibiotics, the main
      side-effects being hypersensitivity reactions.

AB  - No preventive treatment other than intestinal decontamination with oral colimycin
      was given. Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin 200-300 mg/kg, netilmicin 6-7.5
      mg/kg and cloxacillin 50-100 mg/kg was initiated within 6 to 12 hours of clinical

      relapse during transplantation 2), and there was 1 case each of idiopathic bone
      marrow aplasia, metastatic sympathico-blastoma and lymphohistiocytosis. Mean age 
      was 9 years (range: 2-19 years). The combined antibiotic therapy was continued
      until recovery from aplasia in case of success and discontinued after 48 hours in
      case of failure. Bacteriological examinations were negative in 19 patients and
      positive in 10; 13 strains were isolated, mostly staphylococci and streptococci. 
      Apyrexia was obtained in 24 patients, 11 of whom had a rise of temperature with
      negative bacteriology about 10 days later. There were 4 initial failures and one 
      unassessable result. An atopic patient developed a skin rash on the 3rd day of
      treatment. There was no death, no superinfection and non clinical or biochemical 
      side-effect. It is concluded that the piperacillin-netilmicin -cloxacillin
      combination, which gave a high success rate and was well tolerated, can be
      recommended in neutropenic children with febrile episodes.

AB  - The effectiveness of piperacillin was investigated in 30 children operated upon
      for peritonitis: 13 had acute appendicitis with puriform peritoneal reaction, or 
      a recently perforated appendix; 5 had generalized peritonitis of appendicular
      origin, and 13 had intraperitoneal abscess. In the 12 children who underwent
      right iliac appendicectomy (with post-operative drainage in 3), piperacillin was 
      administered alone during 5 days; clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained 
      in all cases; the mean duration of stay in hospital was 7 days. The 5 cases of
      generalized peritonitis required drainage; piperacillin was given alone in 4 of
      them and combined with an aminoglycoside and metronidazole in one who was in poor
      general condition. Bacteriology showed a predominance of Escherichia coli alone
      or associated with other organisms. Clinical and bacteriological cure was
      obtained in 3 patients; the mean duration of stay in hospital was 12 days. Seven 
      of the 13 cases of intraperitoneal abscess needed drainage. Piperacillin was
      administered alone for 7 days on average in 10 cases and combined with an
      aminoglycoside and metronidazole in 2 cases. Eight patients had a favourable
      course, 5 developed complications. In all 3 groups piperacillin was tell
      tolerated. A patch of urticaria was noted in 2 cases and a transient skin rash in
      2 other cases. No neutropenia was observed in these children whose treatment
      never exceeded 10 days.

AB  - The study involved 70 neonates born at 27 to 48 weeks of pregnancy (mean: 34.2
      weeks) and weighing between 840 and 4350 g (mean: 1860 g). In every case
      piperacillin was combined with an aminoglycoside. The infants were treated for
      materno-foetal infection (14), post-partum infection (19), enterocolitis (18,
      surgical in 9 cases) and other post-operative infections (19). The antibiotic
      combination was given prophylactically in 2 cases. Fifty micro-organisms were
      isolated in 39 patients: 24 from blood (hemoculture), 2 from CSF, 24 from
      multiple peripheral samples. There were 13 Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus
      B, D, A, Listeria spp.) and 37 Gram-negative organisms (E. coli 14, Klebsiella
      spp. 10, Enterobacter spp. 6). Clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained in 
      67 patients. Three failures were recorded, with resistance to treatment of
      Klebsiella pneumoniae and emergence (at hemoculture) of Klebsiella oxytoca under 
      treatment in one patient and of Enterobacter cloacae in another patient. A
      pharmacokinetic study was performed in 47 neonates. Piperacillin (75 mg/kg per
      dose) was given twice a day until the 8th day post-partum and three times a day
      subsequently. The antibiotic was administered either by 30-min infusions or by
      intravenous or intramuscular injections; 124 serum level measurements were
      carried out at peak and/or residual level. In 44 infants with normal renal and
      hepatic function the mean residual level was 23 micrograms/ml (range: 7-100
      micrograms/ml) and the mean peak level was 119 micrograms/ml (range: 47-278
      micrograms/ml). No local or systemic side-effect was noted, and there was no
      evidence of toxicity.

PG  - 2336-8
AB  - The clinical activity of piperacillin was evaluated in 34 children (mean age: 8
      years) presenting with severe infection (septicaemia, meningitis,
      bronchopneumonia, pyelonephritis). A bacteriological diagnosis was established in
      24 cases. The mean duration of treatment was 11 days, and the mean dose 220
      mg/kg/day administered in three injections. In 25 cases piperacillin was combined
      with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside (20 cases). Clinical cure or
      improvement was obtained in 29 children (85%). Treatment was well tolerated, with
      only 2 cases of moderate blood eosinophilia. In view of these results the authors
      suggest that piperacillin could be used in children in two circumstances: severe 
      infections caused by Gram-negative cocci or bacilli in children with cystic
      fibrosis or neutropenia, and against infections contracted in intensive care
      units, or in children with febrile leucopenia, combined with an aminoglycoside in
      the absence of, or pending bacteriological results.

PG  - 2332-5
AB  - In 10 patients undergoing cholecystectomy peroperative samples of serum, bile and
      gall bladder tissue were obtained one hour after intravenous injection of 2 g of 
      piperacillin. Measurements were made by high performance liquid chromatography.
      Mean concentrations of piperacillin were 81.7 +/- 13.6 micrograms/ml in serum
      (S), 382 +/- 110 micrograms/ml in choledochal bile (CB), 30.8 +/- 8.5
      micrograms/ml in gall bladder bile and 10.5 +/- 2.6 micrograms/g of gall bladder 
      tissue. With a CB/S ratio of 4.7, piperacillin may be classified among
      beta-lactams showing good distribution in the biliary tract. This property would 
      make piperacillin useful against the pathogens usually responsible for biliary
      tract infections.

AB  - High serum levels and low degree of protein binding are the main factors which
      confer upon piperacillin a good distribution in tissues and biological fluids. In
      CSF, interstitial fluid, pleural and peritoneal fluids, piperacillin levels
      varied depending on the dose and on local inflammatory conditions; they reached
      high values ranging from 20 to 50 micrograms/ml corresponding to 18 to 25% of
      simultaneous serum levels. In bile, high and early levels of piperacillin were
      achieved, reaching about 1.200 to 3.200 micrograms/ml 100 min after i.v.
      injection of 2 or 4 g of the drug; in gallbladder wall more than 500 micrograms/g
      were measured. High tissue concentrations were found after 4 g i.v. of the drug
      in the renal cortex: 23 to 115 micrograms/g; in prostatic tissue: 70
      micrograms/g; in bone: 15 micrograms/g; in cardiac tissue, especially myocardial 
      tissue: 113 micrograms/g. In the female genital tract, the penetration of
      piperacillin was noticeable; levels of 15 to 45 micrograms/g were measured in
      uterus, ovary and salpinx: in contrast, placental transfer of piperacillin was
      limited. In the respiratory tract, the distribution of piperacillin was rapid,
      and concentrations of 12 to 30 micrograms/ml and 25 to 55 micrograms/g were found
      in bronchial secretions and bronchial mucosa respectively a 4 g i.v. dose.
      Studies of piperacillin distribution in the human body indicate that the drug
      reaches therapeutic levels in most tissues and biological fluids.

PG  - 2321-3
AB  - One single 4 g dose of piperacillin was administered by intravenous infusion over
      30 min to 15 patients aged from 66 to 90 years (mean +/- s.e.m.: 79.8 +/- 2.0
      years); the patients mean weight was 53 +/- 4 kg. Fifteen samples of blood were
      withdrawn from each subject. Plasma piperacillin levels were measured by high
      performance liquid chromatography with detection in ultraviolet light at 214 nm. 
      Mean plasma piperacillin concentrations in elderly subjects, measured 0.5, 2 and 
      12 h after dosing, were 168.5 +/- 15.7, 79.9 +/- 11.5 and 1.72 +/- 0.69
      microgram.ml-1, as against 146.8 +/- 10.6, 35.5 +/- 3.9 and 0.212 +/- 0.040
      microgram.ml-1 in healthy young adults. Plasma piperacillin concentrations versus
      time curves obtained after the infusion was discontinued were bi-exponential,
      with half-lives T1/2 (lambda 1) and T1/2 (lambda 2) of 0.65 +/- 0.11 and 1.72 +/-
      0.09 h respectively; the corresponding figures in young adults were 0.59 +/- 0.03
      and 1.81 +/- 0.13 h respectively). In elderly subjects the mean total clearance
      of piperacillin (ClT = 2.90 +/- 0.25 ml.min-1.kg-1) was reduced by 15% (NS) and
      the volume of distribution during steady state (Vdss = 0.337 +/- 0.027 L.kg-1)
      was increased by 43% (P less than 0.001). As a result, the mean time of
      piperacillin stay in the body (MRS = Vdss/Cl) was practically doubled in elderly 
      subjects (2.09 +/- 0.15 h as against 1.15 +/- 0.04 h in young adults (P less than
      0.01).

PG  - 2317-20
AB  - Launched two years ago, piperacillin is administered either alone or combined
      with other antibiotics. Broadening the antibacterial spectrum, looking for
      synergism and preventing the emergence of resistant mutants constitute a major
      preoccupation, especially in immunodepressed patients, and an indication for
      combined antibiotic therapy. The most effective combination, justified by in
      vitro tests, consists of a beta-lactam antibiotic and an aminoglycoside. In vitro
      studies have demonstrated an antagonistic effect between two beta-lactam
      antibiotics, and mutants have been isolated in vivo. The results obtained with
      the piperacillin-vancomycin combination are not as good as those obtained with
      previous combinations. The advent of new compounds, such as aztreonam,
      fluorinated quinolones and beta-lactamase inhibitors offers hopes of excellent
      results.

PG  - 2313-6
AB  - The hundred and ninety-two combinations were tested against 17 strains chosen
      from the results of MIC determination (disc method): 5 enterococci exhibiting low
      level resistance (r) or high level resistance (R) to streptomycin (S) and
      gentamicin (G): 2 strains Sr Gr, 2 strains SR Gr and 1 strain Sr GR; 12
      enterobacteria chosen for their resistance phenotypes to beta-lactams and
      aminoglycosides and because they are the most frequent clinical isolates: 2
      strains Amos Tics Ctns (group 1), 4 strains AmoR Tics CtnR (gr. II), 4 strains
      AmoR TicR Ctns (gr. III) and 2 strains AmoR TicR CtnR (gr. IV). MIC and MBC were 
      assessed for the 17 strains (Mueller Hinton broth). Combinations were carried out
      by a checkerboard micromethod. FBC index was calculated for each combination.
      Against enterococci the 50 combinations were: piperacillin versus ampicillin +
      aminoglycosides (streptomycin, tobramycin, amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin).
      Against enterobacteria piperacillin was combined with different aminoglycosides
      depending on their resistance phenotypes. These combinations were compared with
      ticarcillin or mezlocillin or cefotaxime + aminoglycosides (total number 142).
      The species studied produced different results: with the enterococci Gr
      synergistic effects (FBC = 0.62-0.75) were rare; additive and indifferent effects
      were predominant. With the GR strain some antagonistic effects were observed.
      With the enterobacteria, in groups I and II synergistic effects were frequent and
      almost equivalent regardless of the beta-lactam chosen. In groups III and IV
      (TicR) piperacillin MICs were greater than or equal to 128 mg/l and mezlocillin
      MICs greater than 512 mg/l; the synergistic effects were significant (FBC from
      0.25 to 0.62). beta-lactam + amikacin or netilmicin, and especially piperacillin 
      + amikacin, were found to have the most frequent synergistic effects upon the
      strains tested. Mezlocillin combinations cannot be used clinically; the use of
      piperacillin combinations requires further discussion. On the other hand,
      cefotaxime + aminoglycosides combinations are active against those TicR strains.

      beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone. For ticarcillin-sensitive strains the most 
      rapid bacterial inoculum size decrease was observed at 2.5 h with the
      piperacillin-amikacin combination, and a bactericidal effect was obtained within 
      4.5 h when amikacin was combined with ticarcillin, azlocillin, piperacillin,
      ceftazidime or cefsulodin. For ticarcillin-resistant strains a bactericidal
      effect was obtained within 4.5 h when amikacin was combined with piperacillin,

TI  - [Enzymologic aspect of piperacillin combinations].
PG  - 2303-8
AB  - Like all penicillins, piperacillin exhibits some susceptibility to
      beta-lactamases of the penicillinase type, including those produced by
      Staphylococcus aureus and the TEM, OXA and CARB enzymes isolated from
      Gram-negative bacilli. Piperacillin is very slightly hydrolyzed by
      cephalosporinases, which makes it similar to 3rd generation cephalosporins. When 
      tested with Enterobacter cloacae GN 5797 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NTC 8303, two
      strains which produce inducible cephalosporinases, piperacillin had moderate
      inductive activity compared to cefoxitin, a potent inducer. Induction was very
      low with Enterobacter, but the drug was slightly more sensitive to Pseudomonas.
      Inhibition of this type of beta-lactamase synthesis was very strong when
      piperacillin was combined with amikacin and weaker when it was combined with
      pefloxacin. The piperacillin-amikacin combination prevented the development of
      piperacillin-resistant mutants of Enterobacter and Pseudomonas and, probably, of 
      all Gram-negative bacilli. In our tests, the piperacillin-pefloxacin combination 
      was of interest only against Enterobacter, and probably against all
      enterobacteria, since Pseudomonas mutants that resist pefloxacin are fairly
      easily obtained in vitro.

AB  - The bactericidal activity of piperacillin was evaluated by the kill rate kinetics
      method. Piperacillin compared with amoxicillin, amdinocillin, mezlocillin,
      cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. Against E. coli, piperacillin and
      antibiotics electively bound to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 had the same, 
      mainly time-dependent, bactericidal activity. Antibiotics bound to PBP 1 and 2
      mainly have a dose-dependent activity. The bactericidal activity of piperacillin 
      against E. coli was enhanced when the drug was combined with amoxicillin and
      amdinocillin; in contrast, the kill rate remained unmodified when piperacillin
      was combined with latamoxef. When the piperacillin-amikacin combination was
      tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and
      Serratia marcescens, early synergism (5th hour), was weak, but after 24 hours
      piperacillin reduced the regrowth observed with the aminoglycoside, and synergism
      was much more pronounced irrespective of the species investigated.

TI  - [Mechanism of enzymatic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics].
PG  - 2290-6
AB  - The resistance of bacteria, particularly Gram-negative bacteria, to beta-lactam
      antibiotics is principally caused by enzymes. Beta-lactamases inactivate these
      antibiotics by opening, more or less rapidly, the beta-lactam ring. The
      chronology of therapeutic discoveries is governed by natural and acquired
      resistance. The first step was to establish the characteristics of
      beta-lactamases (location, biogenesis, enzymatic profile, affinity constant,
      inhibition profile, isoelectric point, molecular weight, genetic determination,
      etc.). Advances in the selection of natural or semi-synthetic compound are
      centred on the following points: increased stability to beta-lactamases,
      inhibitory effect, reduced inducibility, low affinity for the enzyme, greater
      speed of penetration through the bacterial wall, increased tropism for targets.
      Notable among the new beta-lactam antibiotics are acylureidopenicillins,
      beta-lactamase inhibitors and carbapenems. The antibacterial activity of third
      generation cephalosporins is 10 to 1000 times higher than that of previous
      cephalosporins; the result is a wider spectrum including, in particular,
      cephalosporinase-producing organisms. Concerning acquired resistance, the
      behaviour of new antibiotics must be examined by comparing the minimum inhibitory
      concentrations of isogeneic and clinical strains, and according to phenotype or
      mechanism: sensitive, penicillinase producer, cephalosporinase producer or
      producer of both penicillinases and cephalosporinases. During synthesis of a
      penicillinase, penicillins and some cephalosporins are more or less inactivated. 
      With a constitutive cephalosporinase, all cephalosporins are inactivated as are, 
      to a lesser degree, penicillins and monobactams, e.g. aztreonam. The emergence of
      new enzymes, including broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, and their extension to
      sensitive bacteria show that the enzymatic mechanism still has potentials for
      development.

TI  - [Mechanisms of action of beta-lactam antibiotics and mechanisms of non-enzymatic 
      resistance].
PG  - 2282-9
AB  - The mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics, and the non-enzymatic resistance
      mechanisms to their activity, are intimately linked to the structure and
      biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. The bacteriostatic effect of beta-lactam
      antibiotics is related to their various interactions and concomitant inhibition
      of essential enzymes (transpeptidases, carboxypeptidases) involved in the
      terminal stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. These cytoplasmic
      membrane-associated target enzymes bind the antibiotics covalently, and hence are
      known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The bactericidal effect of these
      antibiotics is due to a second step following on from the inhibition of cell
      division and growth, in which the activation of an autolytic system causes cell
      death. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in Gram-positive bacteria, in the
      absence of a beta-lactamase, is due to various modifications of the PBPs. Such
      mechanisms are often found in enterococci, pneumococcus, ans staphylococci. With 
      Gram-negative bacteria such modifications of PBPs are only a rare basis for
      resistance. The presence of an outer membrane brings another factor into the
      activity of beta-lactam antibiotics, which is the facility with the antibiotics
      can diffuse through specialised proteins termed porins. It is generally a
      modification of the amounts of these proteins, or some other components of the
      outer membrane, which causes the non-enzymatic mechanism of resistance,
      particularly in species such as Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia and
      Pseudomonas.

AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin and three other
      antibiotics (amoxicillin, cefoxitin, metronidazole) against 165 strains of
      obligate anaerobes isolated in hospitals in 1985 and 1986 were determined by the 
      Wilkins-Chalgren agar medium dilution method. Among the 67 strains of Bacteroides
      fragilis, 98.5% were sensitive to piperacillin (MIC less than or equal to 128
      mg/l), 100% were sensitive to metronidazole (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l),
      11.9% were resistant to cefoxitin (MIC greater than 32 mg/l) and 46% were
      resistant to amoxicillin (MIC greater than 16 mg/l). The MIC50 was about 4 mg/l
      with piperacillin, 8 mg/l with cefoxitin and 0.5 mg/l with metronidazole. All 32 
      strains of Clostridium perfringens were sensitive to the 4 antibiotics tested,
      with an MIC50 of about 0.06 mg/l with piperacillin, 0.125 mg/l with amoxicillin
      and 0.5 mg/l with cefoxitin and metronidazole. All other strains of Clostridium
      spp. (33 in all) were sensitive to piperacillin and metronidazole; the MIC's were
      about 0.06 mg/l with piperacillin, 0.25 mg/l with amoxicillin and metronidazole
      and 0.5 mg/l with cefoxitin. Seven strains (C. innocuum 5, C. difficile 1, C.
      ramosum 1) were resistant to cefoxitin. All 33 strains of Peptostreptococcus and 
      Peptococcus were sensitive to the 4 antibiotics tested. Although metronidazole
      still is the most effective of anti-anaerobes agents, piperacillin has proved to 
      be effective against most anaerobic bacteria, including B. fragilis. It is
      clearly superior to amoxicillin and relatively superior to cefoxitin, notably
      against this species.

      is naturally resistant to TIC and CAR, was 4 mg/l. Enterobacter, Serratia and
      Citrobacter showed two populations of strains: the first was sensitive to the
      five penicillins tested (MIC50 of PIP: 1 to 2 mg/l); the second was resistant to 
      all of them. PIP and AZL were more active (MIC50 8 mg/l) against Ps. aeruginosa
      than MEZ, TIC and CAR. All five penicillins had limited activity against
      Acinetobacter (MIC50 less than 16 mg/l). PIP, MEZ and AZL were more active than
      TIC and CAR against enterococci. In a second study, the activity of PIP was
      evaluated by standard sensitivity tests on 4993 strains of enterobacteria, Ps.
      aeruginosa and Acinetobacter classified according to their phenotype of
      resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. PIP was regularly active against
      enterobacteria and Ps. aeruginosa strains devoid of acquired resistance. The
      activity of PIP was significantly reduced against enterobacteria strains with a
      phenotype suggesting induced penicillinase production. However, the inhibition
      zone diameters, although reduced, remained within what is now considered the
      sensitivity range (notably with E. coli and Proteus spp), which raises the
      problem of in vitro tests interpretation. PIP was active against E. coli strains 
      with a "cephalosporinase" phenotype, but inactive against cefotaxime resistant
      strains of: Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Serratia. The activity of PIP on
      CAR-resistant Ps. aeruginosa strains was significantly reduced, but the
      inhibition zone diameter in one quarter of them was still within limits of
      sensitivity.

TI  - [Does arterial compliance play a role in the physiopathology of hypertension?].
PG  - 2243-6
AB  - The buffering function of arteries consists of damping down cardiac pulsatility. 
      This function can be evaluated by measuring arterial compliance using pulsed
      Doppler and pulse wave velocity measurements and analysis of pressure and flow
      waves in arteries. In human hypertension, the reduction of arterial compliance is
      well-documented; it is not only due to increased stretching of the arteries
      consecutive to the rise in blood pressure, but also to the fact that structural
      and/or functional changes in these vessels, as suggested by the fact that
      compliance is reduced in patients with borderline and mild hypertension and does 
      not necessarily vary in parallel to drug-induced changes in blood pressure.
      Furthermore, arterial compliance is heterogeneously altered in borderline
      hypertension according to the level of cardiac output and in sustained
      hypertension according to the degree of arterial aging. Finally, reduced arterial
      compliance, by impairing the buffering function of arteries, increases arterial
      pulsatility and its adverse effects on cardiac load and on cyclic stress of
      arteries.

      cases].
PG  - 2239-42
AB  - During the 23 consecutive annual epidemics of Argentine haemorrhagic fever
      observed from 1959 to 1983, a group of 4,433 patients were treated at Junin
      (Argentina) with convalescent's plasma; the overall mortality rate was 3.29%. In 
      1958, before convalescent's plasma was used, the mortality rate in 448 patients

PG  - 2231-4
AB  - From a retrospective analysis of 117 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with
      anemia and/or thrombocytopenia studied by isotopic methods to determine the
      mechanism(s) of cytopenia, the following conclusions could be drawn: peripheral
      hyperdestruction is the only or main cause in 60% of the thrombocytopenias and in
      30% of anemias; the prognosis (survival at three years) is significantly better
      in patients with hyperdestruction than in those with cytopenia due to cell
      production defect; the choice of therapy should be guided by the mechanism of
      cytopenia. An analysis of the mechanism of anemia and thrombocytopenia should
      therefore be included in prospective protocols, and the therapy protocol design
      should be modified according to this mechanism.

TI  - Yeast mitochondrial ATPase subunit 8, normally a mitochondrial gene product,
      expressed in vitro and imported back into the organelle.
PG  - 3651-5
AB  - Subunit 8 of yeast mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase is a proteolipid made on
      mitochondrial ribosomes and inserted directly into the inner membrane for
      assembly with the other F0 membrane-sector components. We have investigated the
      possibility of expressing this extremely hydrophobic, mitochondrially encoded
      protein outside the organelle and directing its import back into mitochondria
      using a suitable N-terminal targeting presequence. This report describes the
      successful import in vitro of ATPase subunit 8 proteolipid into yeast
      mitochondria when fused to the targeting sequence derived from the precursor of
      Neurospora crassa ATPase subunit 9. The predicted cleavage site of matrix
      protease was correctly recognized in the fusion protein. A targeting sequence
      from the precursor of yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit VI was unable to direct
      the subunit 8 proteolipid into mitochondria. The proteolipid subunit 8 exhibited 
      a strong tendency to embed itself in mitochondrial membranes, which interfered
      with its ability to be properly imported when part of a synthetic precursor.

TI  - Sequence conservation in the protein coding and intron regions of the engrailed
      transcription unit.
PG  - 3583-9
AB  - Engrailed (en) is a gene involved in proper segmentation of the Drosophila
      embryo. The predicted en protein contains a homeodomain and regions rich in
      polyalanine, polyglutamine, polyglutamate/aspartate and serine. We have taken an 
      evolutionary approach to define which regions may be of fundamental importance by
      examining the D. virilis genomic sequence homologous to the D. melanogaster en
      primary transcription unit. Sequence homology begins at the first ATG of a long
      open reading frame yielding proteins of 584 and 552 amino acids for the D.
      virilis and D. melanogaster proteins, respectively. The predicted amino acid
      sequence can be divided into conserved and non-conserved domains. The C-terminal 
      30% of the protein (which includes the homeodomain) is completely conserved. In
      the N-terminal 70% of the protein, the overall conservation is 71%, but
      non-conservative amino acid changes occur in clusters and there are short
      stretches of highly conserved sequence. A region rich in glutamate and aspartate 
      is conserved and has homology to an 18-amino acid sequence present in members of 
      the myc family of proteins. Major differences in the size of the two proteins
      occur in regions of non-conserved repeated sequences. In the introns of the
      engrailed transcription units there are long stretches of conservation,
      suggesting this DNA may be of functional importance.

TI  - Introduction of human chromosome 11 via microcell transfer controls tumorigenic
      expression of HeLa cells.
PG  - 3461-6
AB  - Both tumorigenic segregant HeLa X human fibroblast hybrids and tumorigenic HeLa
      (D98/AH-2) cells can be converted to a non-tumorigenic state following
      introduction of a single copy of a fibroblast t(X;11) chromosome. The
      translocated chromosome contains approximately 95% of the 11 chromosome and the
      q26-qter portion of the X chromosome which contains the hypoxanthine guanine
      phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene. Introduction of a human X chromosome has 
      no effect on tumorigenic expression. Suppression of tumorigenicity is relieved by
      selecting cells which have lost the t(X;11) chromosome by growth in medium
      containing 6-thioguanine (6-TG). Further, reintroduction of the t(X;11)
      chromosome into tumorigenic 6TGR cells again suppresses tumorigenicity. Thus, the
      introduction of a single copy of a human chromosome 11 is sufficient to
      completely suppress the tumorigenic phenotype of HeLa cells and is suggestive of 
      the presence of tumor-suppressor gene(s) on this chromosome.

TI  - [Effects of various pancreatic secretagogues on somatostatin binding to rat
      pancreatic acinar cell plasma membranes].
PG  - 1376-83
AB  - The effects of pretreatment with pancreatic secretagogues and subsequently
      activated cellular events on [125I-Tyr1] somatostatin binding to acinar membranes
      were studied. Pretreatment of pancreatic acini with bombesin at increasing
      concentrations for 120 min reduced labeled somatostatin binding to the acinar
      membranes in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximal reduction of binding at
      10(-8)M bombesin (44.3 +/- 1.8% of control). The maximal inhibition of labeled
      somatostatin binding by pretreatment with bombesin was almost comparable to that 
      with COOH-terminal octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK8) or carbamylcholine
      (carbachol). Furthermore, pretreatment of acini with vasoactive intestinal
      peptide (VIP) as well as secretin resulted in a small, but significant decrease
      of subsequent labeled somatostatin binding. In addition, adenosine 3', 5' cyclic 
      nucleotide derivatives or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor mimicked the effect of
      VIP or secretin. The effect of simultaneous pretreatment of acini with VIP and
      carbachol on subsequent labeled somatostatin binding appeared to be almost equal 
      to the calculated additive value for each peptide. These results suggest that the
      binding of somatostatin to its receptors in the pancreatic acini may be regulated
      via two functionally distinct pathways.

TI  - Kouska's fallacy: the error of the divided denominator.
PG  - 1449-50
AB  - The significance of two normally independent findings in a single patient is
      often difficult to assess. One simple measure of the likelihood of random
      coincidence is the joint probability, based on the assumption that the findings
      are independent. Unfortunately, this technique is often used wrongly. The error
      is the division of an event into its components, followed by calculation of their
      joint probability. These two processes, used together, make the likelihood of a
      common event happening seem very improbable. This can be termed the error of the 
      divided denominator, or Kouska's fallacy, after a fictional character who used
      this technique to disprove the existence of life.

TI  - Who's afraid of angina pectoris? Separating the symptom from the marker.
PG  - 1442-3
AB  - 100 cardiologists were asked for their views on the risk associated with an
      episode of exertional angina in patients with stable angina. 58% thought that
      such an episode carried some risk of permanent damage or death, and 78% advised
      their patients to avoid anginal pain. In contrast, exercise studies done during
      the evaluation of anti-anginal drugs indicate that exertional angina can be
      provoked frequently and repeatedly without apparent risk, and other studies have 
      shown that repeated exercise to the onset of angina is not only safe but improves
      exercise tolerance. Epidemiological investigations suggest that sudden death and 
      myocardial infarction do not commonly occur during exertion, and our knowledge of
      pathology indicates that both events are usually caused by acute coronary
      thrombosis. Many physicians seem to treat the symptom of angina because they are 
      unduly motivated by fear of the underlying potentially fatal disease for which
      angina is a marker. Such an attitude will tend to cause undue anxiety among
      patients, will lead to unnecessary restriction of patients' activities, and may
      result in excessive invasive treatment of mild angina.

TI  - Common-sense beliefs about illness: a mediating role for the doctor.
PG  - 1435-7
AB  - A great deal is said these days about how important it is for doctors to pay
      attention to the patient's beliefs about his or her disease. Better knowledge of 
      such beliefs, it is argued, will enable the doctor to counter ignorance, enhance 
      communication, and reduce non-compliance. The view advanced here is that the
      significance of patients' beliefs and their frequent resistance to rational
      correction will emerge only if they are seen as components in a process of
      "narrative reconstruction". It is suggested that the main difficulty is not
      ignorance but rather the fact that doctor and patient have different purposes:
      whereas the doctor's objective is to explain the aetiology of the disease, the
      patient may be more concerned to make sense of the disruption caused by the
      disease.

AB  - In 13 infants with a history of wheezing, airways resistance and specific
      conductance worsened after administration of nebulised salbutamol (0.5 ml
      sabutamol respirator solution in 1.5 ml normal saline). This paradoxical
      bronchoconstriction was greatest at 5 min and lasted for up to 15 min. The
      nebulised solution was found to be acidic and hypo-osmolar, both of which
      properties have been linked to bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects, but
      even with an initially iso-osmolar solution osmolality increased with time of
      nebulisation because of evaporation.

TI  - A non-invasive method for measuring cardiac output: the effect of Christmas
      lunch.
PG  - 1422-4
AB  - Cardiac output was measured in ten patients at routine cardiac catheterisation
      and three patients with severe heart failure by means of a carbon dioxide
      rebreathing technique with a computer-assisted mass spectrometer and compared
      with cardiac output measured by thermodilution. There was a close correlation (r 
      = 0.96, p less than 0.01) between the two methods. Cardiac output measured by the
      carbon dioxide rebreathing technique increased after a typical Christmas lunch by
      a mean of 1.6 1/min in a group of healthy volunteers.

TI  - Attenuation of exercise-induced asthma by acupuncture.
PG  - 1419-22
AB  - A prospective randomised single-blind study of the effects of real and sham
      acupuncture on exercise-induced asthma was conducted in nineteen children. Forced
      expiratory flow in 1st second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak
      expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured throughout acupuncture and after
      treadmill exercise. Neither real nor sham acupuncture affected the basal
      bronchomotor tone but both, when applied 20 min before exercise, attenuated
      exercise induced asthma: mean maximum percentage falls in FEV1, FVC, and PEFR
      were 44.4%, 33.3%, and 49.5% without acupuncture; 23.8%, 15.8%, and 25.9% after
      real acupuncture; and 32.6%, 26.1%, and 34.3% after sham acupuncture. Real
      acupuncture provided better protection against exercise-induced asthma than did
      sham acupuncture (p less than 0.05).

PG  - 1416-9
AB  - In a randomised controlled trial, twelve matched pairs of patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease received traditional Chinese acupuncture or placebo
      acupuncture. After three weeks' treatment the traditional-acupuncture group
      showed significantly greater benefit in terms of subjective scores of
      breathlessness and six-minute walking distance. Objective measures of lung
      function were unchanged in either group. Whether these differences are mediated
      by endogenous opiate and/or peptide release remains speculative.

      about difficult cases of acute abdominal pain.
PG  - 1414-5
AB  - Fine-catheter aspiration cytology of the peritoneal cavity was successfully
      undertaken in 25 of 27 hospital inpatients with acute abdominal pain because it
      was not clear whether they required urgent laparotomy. Cytological specimens were
      prepared by the cyto-sieve technique. The main test criterion was the percentage 
      of neutrophils in the peritoneal cell sample. The decision before the test about 
      urgent laparotomy was correct in 14 of the 27 patients, whereas the decision
      after the test was correct in 26 of the 27 patients (p = 0.001). 4 patients were 
      saved unnecessary laparotomy and 8 further delay in laparotomy.

TI  - Multicentre double-blind study of effect of intrathecally administered natural
      human fibroblast interferon on exacerbations of multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1411-3
AB  - In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year multicentre study
      intrathecally administered natural human fibroblast interferon (IFN-B) was
      effective in reducing exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with
      exacerbating/remitting disease. The mean reduction in exacerbation rate of 34
      patients who received IFN-B (recipients) was significantly greater during the
      study than that of 35 patients who received placebo (p less than 0.04). The
      prestudy exacerbation rates were comparable in recipients and controls, but the
      rate at the end of the study was significantly lower in recipients than in
      controls (p less than 0.001). IFN-B was given by nine or ten lumbar punctures
      over the first 6 months of the study, and patient observations continued for 2
      years. IFN-B was well tolerated in 95% of the recipients, and the side-effects
      experienced were clearly acceptable for the benefits achieved. Low doses of
      indomethacin reduced the toxicity of IFN-B and played an important role in
      successful double-blinding.

TI  - Transcriptional and translational initiation sites of IS50. Control of
      transposase and inhibitor expression.
PG  - 781-91
AB  - We have examined transcriptional start sites responsible for expression of the
      transposase and transposition inhibitor proteins encoded by IS50R, and determined
      the likely translational start site of transposase. Amino-terminal analysis of a 
      transposase-beta-galactosidase fusion protein gave the sequence
      Met-Ile-Thr-Ser-Ala, which corresponds to the predicted amino acid sequence
      starting at position 93 of IS50. S1 nuclease mapping of IS50 RNA produced in vivo
      indicated that three transcripts, T1, T2 and T3, start near this position. Only
      T1 starts upstream from the transposase amino terminus. T2 corresponds to an
      in-vitro transcript described previously. Analysis of the transcripts and
      proteins produced from deletion derivatives of an IS50-lacZ construct suggested
      that the three transcripts initiate at independent but overlapping promoters
      clustered near the end of IS50. This analysis confirmed that only T1 can encode
      transposase, and that T2 is largely responsible for expression of the inhibitor
      protein. The coding capacity of T3 was not determined. Finally, transcripts that 
      originate outside of IS50 are prevented from expressing transposase because of a 
      secondary structure that is present in these transcripts only.

TI  - Escherichia coli protein synthesis initiation factor IF3 controls its own gene
      expression at the translational level in vivo.
PG  - 767-80
AB  - Measurements of the relative synthesis rates of mRNAs transcribed from the gene
      (thrS) for threonyl-tRNA synthetase and the adjacent gene (infC) for initiation
      factor IF3 show four- to fivefold more infC mRNA than thrS mRNA in vivo,
      suggesting that infC expression can be controlled independently of thrS
      expression. S1 mapping experiments reveal the existence of two transcription
      initiation sites for infC mRNAs internal to the thrS structural gene. Both the
      mRNA measurements and the S1 mapping experiments indicate that the majority of
      infC transcription initiates at the infC proximal promoter. In agreement with
      these results, the deletion of the infC distal promoter from infC-lacZ gene
      fusions does not affect the expression of these gene fusions in vivo.
      Measurements of the relative synthesis rate of infC mRNA in vivo in infC- strains
      overproducing IF3 shows that infC mRNA levels are normal in these strains, thus
      suggesting that IF3 regulates the translation of infC mRNAs in vivo. Extension of
      these experiments using infC-lacZ gene fusions carried on lambda bacteriophage
      and integrated at the lambda att site on the Escherichia coli chromosome shows
      that the expression of infC-lacZ protein fusions, but not infC-lacZ operon
      fusions, is derepressed in two infC- strains. A cellular excess of IF3 represses 
      the expression of an infC-lacZ protein fusion but not an infC-lacZ operon fusion.
      Measurements of the relative mRNA synthesis rates of hybrid infC-lacZ mRNA
      synthesized from an infC-lacZ protein fusion under conditions of a fourfold
      derepression or a threefold repression of hybrid IF3-beta-galactosidase
      expression shows that the hybrid infC-lacZ mRNA levels remain unchanged. These
      results indicate that the cellular levels of IF3 negatively regulate the
      expression of its own gene, infC, at the translational level in vivo.

TI  - Identification and analysis of genes for tetracycline resistance and replication 
      functions in the broad-host-range plasmid pLS1.
PG  - 753-65
AB  - The streptococcal plasmid pMV158 and its derivative pLS1 are able to replicate
      and confer tetracycline resistance in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
      bacteria. Copy numbers of pLS1 were 24, 4 and 4 molecules per genome in
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, respectively.
      Replication of the streptococcal plasmids in E. coli required functional polA and
      recA genes. A copy-number mutation corresponding to a 332 base-pair deletion of
      pLS1 doubled the plasmid copy number in all three species. Determination of the
      complete DNA sequence of pLS1 revealed transcriptional and translational signals 
      and four open reading frames. A putative inhibitory RNA was encoded in the region
      deleted by the copy-control mutation. Two putative mRNA transcripts encoded
      proteins for replication functions and tetracycline resistance, respectively. The
      repB gene encoded a trans-acting, 23,000 Mr protein necessary for replication,
      and the tet gene encoded a very hydrophobic, 50,000 Mr protein required for
      tetracycline resistance. The polypeptides corresponding to these proteins were
      identified by specific labeling of plasmid-encoded products. The tet gene of pLS1
      was highly homologous to tet genes in two other plasmids of Gram-positive origin 
      but different in both sequence and mode of regulation from tet genes of
      Gram-negative origin.

TI  - Rat insulin-like growth factor II gene. A single gene with two promoters
      expressing a multitranscript family.
PG  - 737-52
AB  - We have characterized the single-copy rat gene encoding the protein precursor of 
      insulin-like growth factor II (pre-pro-rIGF-II) that is located downstream from
      and in the same transcriptional orientation as the homologous insulin II gene
      (5'-insulin-IGF-II-3'). This gene consists of at least three coding exons and
      utilizes two promoters that generate alternate 5' non-coding exons. Multiple
      transcripts from both promoters appear primarily in fetal or neonatal tissues (in
      all of the developmental stages and tissues that we have examined), but they are 
      extremely rare or undetectable in adult tissues, with the exception of the brain 
      and the spinal cord. These transcripts, which exhibit characteristic
      developmental profiles in various tissues, differ both in the presence of one of 
      the alternate 5' non-coding exons and in the length of their fourth exon. The
      possible occurrence of differential splicing or differential polyadenylation (or 
      both) in this region is discussed.

TI  - Mutations affecting two distinct functions of the RNA component of RNase P.
PG  - 3673-9
AB  - The effect of structural changes on the functions of the RNA component (M1 RNA)
      of ribonuclease P (RNase P) of Escherichia coli has been studied using the
      thermosensitive mutants of the rnpB gene. One of the mutants, ts709, has two G--A
      substitutions at positions 89 and 365 from the 5' end of M1 RNA. Of these
      substitutions, the one at position 89 from the 5' end is responsible for the
      phenotype of this mutant. Although the RNase P activity of ts709 is
      thermosensitive, the mutant M1 RNA has the same catalytic activity as the
      wild-type RNA. M1 RNA of another mutant, ts2418, has a G--A substitution at
      position 329. This mutant RNA has extremely low catalytic activity. The upstream 
      mutational site of ts709 appears to play a role in the association with the
      protein subunit, whereas the mutational site of ts2418 is related to the
      catalytic function of M1 RNA.

TI  - Differential nuclease sensitivity identifies tight contacts between yeast
      pre-mRNA and spliceosomes.
PG  - 3517-23
AB  - The oligonucleotide-directed RNase H sensitivity of a yeast (Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae) pre-mRNA was determined in an in vitro splicing reaction. While most 
      of the pre-mRNA was sensitive to cleavage, the regions of the 5' splice site and 
      TACTAAC box were found to be highly resistant. The biochemical requirements for
      protection against nuclease attack parallel those of both spliceosome formation
      and splicing. Most of the uncleaved pre-mRNA remaining after RNase H challenge
      was found associated with two forms of the yeast spliceosome. Differences in the 
      RNase H sensitivity of pre-mRNA found in the two spliceosome forms indicate an
      increased association of splicing factors with the 5' splice site during
      spliceosome assembly.

TI  - Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP and DM-20) transcripts are deleted in jimpy
      mutant mice.
PG  - 3489-93
AB  - The myelin-associated proteolipid protein, PLP, is one of the two major
      components of the central nervous system (CNS) myelin. We analyze, by using a rat
      PLP cDNA and S1 nuclease protection experiments, the PLP transcripts in the mouse
      brain and show that the PLP gene encodes two different but related mRNA
      transcripts, the PLP and the DM-20 transcripts. On the other hand, we demonstrate
      that in the jimpy mutant, which is characterized by an abnormal CNS myelination, 
      both these transcripts are partially deleted in the 3' end of their coding
      region. The deletion is 70 (+/- 5) nucleotides long. Implications of this finding
      for the synthesis of PLP and DM-20 proteins in the mutant are discussed.

TI  - VH gene family utilization in colonies derived from B and pre-B cells detected by
      the RNA colony blot assay.
PG  - 3475-81
AB  - The immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) genes of the mouse have been 
      categorized into families based upon sequence homology. Utilizing the RNA colony 
      blot assay we have determined the expression of eight of these families in B cell
      colonies derived from either surface immunoglobulin positive (sIg+) adult spleen 
      B cells or sIg- fetal liver pre-B cells. We demonstrate, based upon the analysis 
      of greater than 6000 individual colonies, that VH gene usage is a characteristic 
      of the mouse strain studied. C57BL/6 mice most frequently (45%) utilize family
      VHJ558, the largest VH family, whereas BALB/c mice most frequently (22%) utilize 
      family VH7183, the most JH proximal family in BALB/c mice. Moreover, colonies
      derived from sIg- fetal liver derived precursors show similar patterns,
      suggesting that selection based on exogenous antigen is not an important
      parameter in determining VH gene family usage.

PG  - 1580-2
AB  - Early angiosperm leaves from the Aptian (113 to 119 million years ago) Baquero
      Formation of Patagonia have been found in a fossil flora dominated by more than
      100 species of gymnosperms and pteridophytes. They may be the first early
      Cretaceous angiosperm leaves to be reported from southern South America and one
      of the few reported in the Southern Hemisphere. The leaves are large, lobate,
      craspedodromous, and dentate (A-1 teeth) and have ramified tertiary veins and
      random fourth-order venation. Several of these features have been found in coeval
      and younger strata elsewhere, but not in the same combination. They were probably
      a marginal component of the flora.

TI  - New production techniques for alberta oil sands.
PG  - 1515-8
AB  - Low world oil prices represent a serious threat to expanded commercial
      development of the Canadian oil sands in the near term, as they do to all of the 
      higher cost alternatives to crude oil such as oil shales and coal liquefaction.
      Nonetheless, research and field testing of new technology for production of oil
      from oil sands are being pursued by industry and government in Alberta. New
      production technology is being developed in Canada to produce synthetic oil from 
      the vast resources of bitumen trapped in the oil sands and bituminous carbonates 
      of northern Alberta. This technology includes improved methods of mining,
      extraction, and upgrading of bitumen from near-surface deposits as well as new
      drilling and production techniques for thermal production of bitumen from the
      more deeply buried reservoirs. Of particular interest are the cluster drilling
      methods designed to reduce surface disturbance and the techniques for horizontal 
      drilling of wells from underground tunnels to increase the contact of injection
      fluids with the reservoir.

TI  - Advent and course of pastoralism in the kalahari.
PG  - 1509-15
AB  - It has long been thought that farming and herding were comparatively recent
      introductions into the Kalahari and that it has been a preserve of foraging
      "Bushmen" for thousands of years. Agropastoral Bantu-speakers were thought to
      have entered this region only within the last two centuries. However, fully
      developed pastoralism and metallurgy are now shown to have been established in
      the Kalahari from A.D. 500, with extensive grain agriculture and intracontinental
      trade added by A.D. 800. Archeological, linguistic, and historical evidence
      delineates the continuation of mixed economies in the region into the present.
      Consequences of this revised view for anthropological theory and for policy
      planning concerning contemporary Kalahari peoples are indicated.

TI  - [Consequences of after-care in colorectal cancer].
PG  - 851-5
AB  - Results of a computer supported follow-up-program on patients with colorectal
      cancer are presented. Between 1978 and 1985 1024 patients underwent these
      program, the drop-out-rate was 18%. 231 recurrences in 137 patients were
      discovered (40% local recurrence, 30% liver metastases and 30% others). 54% of
      patients with local recurrence and 43% with liver metastases were free of
      symptoms. Radical surgery was performed in 47% of local recurrences and in 24% of
      liver metastases. The three year survival rate after radical surgery for
      recurrence amounted to 28% for local recurrences and to 31% for liver metastases.

TI  - [Status and tasks of biometry in clinical and experimental research].
PG  - 847-51
AB  - The paper starts with reflections on the role of biometry in clinical research.
      Factors which might influence the efficacy of biostatistical consulting of
      clinicians are dealt with. Primarily, advantages and disadvantages of various
      behavioral patterns between the medical investigator and the biometrician are
      discussed. The recruitment and training of new biometricians, organizational
      structures and material foundations of clinical biometry are regarded as further 
      factors influencing a constructive working practice. The paper ends with
      considerations on the future of the discipline.

TI  - [Parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation].
PG  - 842-7
AB  - Total parathyroidectomy, immediate heterotopic autotransplantation and
      cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue was introduced in the surgical treatment
      of drug-resistant renal hyperparathyroidism (rHPT) in 1980 and was performed in
      36 patients. During 34 initial bilateral cervical explorations including
      transcervical thymectomy 142 glands were removed (orthotopic localization: 84%;
      heterotopic localization: 16%). Supernumerary glands were found in 6 patients
      (18%; thymus: 3; cervical fatty tissue: 4). The elevated parathyroid metabolism
      was successfully corrected, in all, but one patient in whom only three glands
      were removed. Biochemical and clinical follow-up examinations showed a
      restitution of the symptoms in 88% 3 to 79 months postoperatively.
      Graft-dependent recurrence of rHPT was diagnosed in one patient. Normocalcemia
      was reestablished by partially excising the grafted tissue under local
      anesthesia. Graft-dependent hypoparathyroidism was suspected in one patient
      because of low levels of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone. Late graft
      failure was not observed during the follow-up period. None of the patients
      required delayed autotransplantation of cryopreserved tissue.

      femoropopliteal area: long-term results].
PG  - 830-8
AB  - The outcome of 532 femoro-popliteal vein grafts performed electively during the
      years 1970 to 1985 for obliterative arterial disease, was analyzed using the
      documentation-system of the Austrian Society for Vascular Surgery, as well as SAS
      and BMDP-software on an IBM 4381 computer of the Medical Faculty. The probability
      of function was estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method, statistical
      differences were checked with Breslow's and Mantel's test, the proportional
      hazards regression model (Cox) was used to elucidate the influence of different
      risk factors on each own and in combination of each other. In the univariate
      analysis, the preoperative clinical status was found to be of prognostic
      significance, but technical details such as intraoperative as well as
      postoperative arteriography or site of the distal anastomosis were not important.
      A postoperative coumarine treatment had no demonstrable impact on graft function,
      but positively influenced the probability of patient survival. Taking into
      account the factors found to be of significance in the univariate analysis (e.g. 
      set of factors: site of distal anastomosis, diabetic state and smoking habits)
      were analyzed using the proportional hazards regression model but were found of
      no major influence. The factors preoperative clinical status, patients age, and
      coumarine therapy significantly influenced the probability of patient survival,
      but diabetes mellitus and smoking were found to be not important.

TI  - [Liver resection of hematogenous and infiltrating metastases].
PG  - 813-20
AB  - Of a total of 245 resections for hepatic metastases 124 operations were performed
      for hematogenic metastases and 36 for infiltrating metastases in continuity with 
      the primary tumour. This group of so-called "major hepatic resections" is
      analysed. The series comprises 83 male and 77 female patients, mean age 62.2
      years. There were 85 resections of the right lobe (39 of those with intrahepatic 
      extension to the left), 45 right) and 30 atypical hepatectomies (at least
      bisegmentectomies). Hematogenic hepatic metastases: 80 resections of hepatic
      metastases following colorectal carcinoma, 15 following cancer of the stomach and
      esophagus, 12 after non-gastrointestinal malignant tumours, 4 resections after
      unknown primary cancer (44% solitary, 32% monolobar multiple, and 24% bilateral
      metastases); synchronous operations were performed in 32% of the patients, in 19%
      so-called interval surgery (mean 7.4 weeks), and in 49% metachrone surgery (mean 
      30 weeks). During 1983 and 1985 our morbidity rate amounted to 10% and the
      letality rate to 7%, as compared to 17% morbidity and 15% letality in the period 
      1965-1983. In both periods, septic postoperative complications outnumbered all
      other causes. The mean survival rate after colorectal carcinoma was 20 months,
      after non-gastro-intestinal malignant growth 19 months, after carcinoma of the
      stomach as well as after malignant biliary tract diseases 5 months. The
      three-year survival rate of colorectal carcinoma amounts to 30%, the five year
      survival rate to 15% including all metastatic stages. The results of interval and
      metachrone resections in forms of survival rates are clearly better than the
      results of synchronous resections with a mean survival time of five
      months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - A 37-year-old female patient reported marked weight loss, prolonged alopecia,
      recurrent infections and watery diarrhoea. Examination revealed Salmonella
      infection, candidiasis and immunological signs of previous toxoplasmosis. Between
      1978 and 1981, the patient had had close sexual relations to a patient with
      haemophilia A. Due to this fact, AIDS was suspected. Serological tests for HIV
      were not available at the time. The findings in DNA image cytometry (nuclear DNA 
      inclusion bodies, polyploid lymphocyte nuclei and binuclear lymphocytes)
      suggested a viral infection of the lymphoid cells. Electron microscopy revealed
      in hepatocytes and cerebral cells intranuclear inclusion bodies whose size and
      contents were not compatible with an infection caused by cytomegalovirus, herpes 
      virus or Epstein-Barr virus. In autopsy, infections of various organ systems such
      as pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, urocystitis, pyelonephritis, Candida
      oesophagitis and enteritis were found.

PG  - 1949-53
AB  - From 923 breast cancers sent in for hormone receptor determination, 745
      diagnostically utilizable Pappenheim-stained biopsy smears at 500-fold
      magnification were classified into eight atypia groups (1-4 without nucleoli, 5-8
      with nucleoli) visually in terms of the severity of the cellular malignancy
      criteria. The hormone receptor status was determined with the dextran-coated
      charcoal method. Values from 10 fmol/mg estrogen receptor (ER) and (or)
      progesterone receptor (PR) content were designated as receptor-positive. There
      was a decrease in the proportion of receptor-positive results with increasing
      degree of atypia from 97% in group 2 (cases with only small nuclei without
      nucleoli) to 37% in group 7 (cases with multiple prominent nucleoli). When the
      average atypia values of subgroups were compared, the highest values were found
      for the 222 receptor-negative carcinomas. The marginally receptor-positive values
      were on average between the receptor-negative and the receptor-positive cases
      with high values. Both the low-ER and the low-PR have more pronounced criteria of
      malignancy compared to the respective high-receptor reference group.

TI  - Requirement of gene transcription and protein synthesis for cold- and

      tissue.
PG  - 366-73
AB  - The increase in propylthiouracil-insensitive 'type II' thyroxine 5'-deiodinase
      activity of brown adipose tissue was investigated in rats exposed to acute cold
      stress or single-dose norepinephrine injection. The 20-fold cold-induced increase
      in enzyme activity showed a 2-h lag phase and reached a maximum after only 8 h;
      reacclimation occurred with a 2-h time lag and a half-life of 2.2 h. 4 h after a 
      single norepinephrine injection, the deiodinase activity was almost identical to 
      that after a 4-h cold stress; norepinephrine could not potentiate the effect of
      the cold stress. Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
      before exposure to cold or before norepinephrine injection totally blocked the
      increase in deiodinase activity, suggesting that the increase is due to de novo
      protein synthesis. The half-life of the enzyme in vivo was estimated to be 0.7 h.
      Treatment with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D totally abolished the
      cold- and norepinephrine-induced increases, indicating that the increase requires
      mRNA synthesis. It was concluded that the dramatic cold-induced increase in
      thyroxine deiodinase activity in brown adipose tissue was not due to activation
      of preexisting enzyme but was fully due to a norepinephrine-induced increase in
      expression of the gene and subsequent synthesis of the protein.

TI  - NMR measurement of intracellular water volume in rat kidney proximal tubules.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - Knowledge of cell water volume is essential for the measurement of concentrations
      of intracellular ions and metabolites in kidney proximal tubules. We have
      developed a method which utilizes 35Cl-NMR as a measure of extracellular volume
      and 2H-NMR, in combination with a membrane-impermeable shift-reagent [Dy-DTPA]2-,
      as a measure of the ratio of intra- and extracellular water volumes. Measurement 
      of extracellular volume by 35Cl-NMR is possible, since the resonance of
      intracellular 35Cl is too broad to be detectable in kidney cells. The 2H-NMR
      measurement exploits the fact that only extracellular water is in direct contact 
      with [Dy-DTPA]2-. However, rapid exchange of water across the cell membrane
      results in only a single 2H2O resonance at a chemical shift which is a weighted
      average of the shifted extra- and unshifted intracellular water resonances.
      Expression of the extracellular volume as a fraction of the total volume by fCl
      and as a fraction of the total water-volume by fD, permits the calculation of the
      fractional cell-water content fw = [(1/fD)-1]/[(1/fCl)-1]. This approach was
      applied to proximal tubular suspensions prepared from the rat kidney. The water
      content was found to be 76.9 +/- 1.8% (n = 6) at 37 degrees C. Increasing
      extracellular osmolality from 295 to 390 mOsm/kg H2O, by addition of mannitol,
      decreased the water content by 21%. Our results are in good agreement with those 
      obtained by the gravimetric method.

TI  - Changes in polypeptide synthesis and glycosylation in mouse embryonic fibroblast 
      C3H/10T1/2 Cl 8 cells caused by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol
      13-acetate.
PG  - 334-45
AB  - The mechanism of tumor promotion is not well understood. We have used the
      transformable, tumor promotable, mouse embryo fibroblast C3H/10T1/2 Cl 8 cells to
      study tumor promoter specific changes in protein synthesis and protein
      glycosylation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate caused a significant increase in the
      synthesis of five cellular and 34 extracellular polypeptides. One of these
      polypeptides has tentatively been identified as ornithine decarboxylase. One new 
      polypeptide (p 62, Mr 58,000) was found in the medium of
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-treated cells. The amounts of several
      excreted proteins were enhanced 5-10 fold by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol
      13-acetate. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate interfered with glycosylation
      both by affecting protein synthesis and also directly with glycosylation. At
      least 15 polypeptides in the medium and two cellular polypeptides decreased after
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate treatment. Two of the major polypeptides
      found in the medium (p 8 and 10, Mr approx. 200,000-220,000) have properties
      similar to fibronectin, while p 9 and 11 both found in the cellular preparations 
      and in the medium (Mr 180,000 and 150,000) were collagenase sensitive and their
      synthesis was inhibited by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate.

      recovered in the portal vein. Intestinal absorption via the lymphatic pathway was
      15.4 +/- 8.9% (n = 10) and 45.9 +/- 10.8% (n = 4) for alpha-tocopherol and
      [14C]oleic acid, respectively. About 99% of alpha-tocopherol in lymph was
      associated with the chylomicron fraction (d less than 1.006 g/ml). In non-fasting
      rats, 51% of serum alpha-tocopherol was associated with chylomicrons/VLDL
      (very-low-density lipoprotein, d less than 1.006 g/ml) and 47% with HDL
      (high-density lipoprotein, 1.05 less than d less than 1.21 g/ml). Our study
      revealed that the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue contain approx. 92%
      of the total mass of alpha-tocopherol measured in ten different organs.
      Parenchymal and nonparenchymal liver cells contributed to 75% and 25% of the
      total mass of alpha-tocopherol in the liver, respectively.

TI  - Lipid domains in fluid membranes: a quick-freeze differential scanning
      calorimetry study.
PG  - 1577-80
AB  - The application of rapid-freezing techniques to differential scanning calorimetry
      (DSC) provides a new approach for understanding the organization of lipids in
      biomembranes. Use of quick-freeze DSC on membranes of mixed lipid composition
      supports the existence of nonrandom distributions of lipids (domains) in fluid
      bilayers. In addition to allowing investigations on the organization of lipids in
      fluid bilayers, the quick-freeze technique now allows calorimetric studies to be 
      carried out on mammalian membranes which, because of their high cholesterol
      content, have not been previously amenable to study by DSC.

TI  - Lipoprotein mutations in pigs are associated with elevated plasma cholesterol and
      atherosclerosis.
PG  - 1573-7
AB  - A strain of pigs bearing three immunogenetically defined lipoprotein-associated
      markers (allotypes), designated Lpb5, Lpr1, and Lpu1, has marked
      hypercholesterolemia on a low fat, cholesterol-free diet. Unlike individuals with
      familial hypercholesterolemia or WHHL rabbits, the affected pigs have normal low 
      density lipoprotein receptor activity. The animals, by 7 months of age, have
      extensive atherosclerotic lesions in all three coronary arteries. This strain of 
      pig represents an animal model for atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia
      associated with mutations affecting the structures of plasma lipoproteins. One of
      the variant apolipoproteins, Lpb5, is apolipoprotein-B. A second variant
      apolipoprotein (Lpr1), termed apo-R, is a 23-kilodalton protein present in both
      the very low density (d less than 1.006 g/ml) and the very high density (d
      greater than 1.21 g/ml) fractions of pig plasma. Isoforms of this protein
      correlate with two Lpr alleles, Lpr1 and Lpr2. The Lpr genes segregate
      independently of the Lpb5 and Lpu1 alleles. The Lpu1 allotype is a component of
      low density lipoprotein and is genetically linked to Lpb5.

TI  - Selective chemical catalysis by an antibody.
PG  - 1570-3
AB  - The immunoglobulin MOPC167, which binds the transition state analog
      p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine with high affinity, catalyzed the hydrolysis of
      the corresponding carbonate 1. MOPC167 catalysis displayed saturation kinetics
      with catalytic constant (kcat) = 0.4 min-1 and Michaelis constant (Km) = 208
      microM, showed substrate specificity, and was inhibited by
      p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine. The rate of the reaction was first order in
      hydroxide ion concentration between pH 6.0 and 8.0. The lower limit for the rate 
      of acceleration of hydrolysis by the antibody above the uncatalyzed reaction was 
      770. This study begins to define the rules for the generation of catalytic
      antibodies.

TI  - Catalytic antibodies.
PG  - 1566-70
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies elicited to haptens that are analogs of the transition
      state for hydrolysis of carboxylic esters behaved as enzymic catalysts with the
      appropriate substrates. These substrates are distinguished by the structural
      congruence of both hydrolysis products with haptenic fragments. The haptens were 
      potent inhibitors of this esterolytic activity, in agreement with their
      classification as transition state analogs. Mechanisms are proposed to account
      for the different chemical behavior of these antibodies with two types of ester
      substrates. The generation of an artificial enzyme through transition state
      stabilization by antibodies was thus demonstrated. These studies indicate a
      potentially general approach to catalyst design.

TI  - A novel human gene closely related to the abl proto-oncogene.
PG  - 1545-8
AB  - A DNA sequence related to the abl proto-oncogene was identified in human
      placenta. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two
      putative exons whose predicted amino acid sequence was most homologous to the
      corresponding sequences of c-abl and v-abl but was related to other tyrosine
      kinase genes as well. The new sequence was localized by in situ hybridization and
      somatic cell genetic analysis to human chromosome 1q24-25, which differs from the
      location of any previously identified tyrosine kinase gene. The detection of a
      novel 12-kb transcript by this gene in human normal and tumor cells establishes
      it as a new member of the tyrosine kinase family that is closely related to but
      distinct from c-abl.

TI  - Nortriptyline in depressed patients with left ventricular impairment.
PG  - 3253-7
AB  - Previous studies of the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on left ventricular
      function in depressed patients with moderate to severe ventricular impairment
      have focused primarily on imipramine hydrochloride. In a prior study, we found
      that although imipramine had no effect on ejection fraction as measured by
      first-pass radionuclide angiography, the treatment could not be tolerated by 50% 
      of the patients because of intolerable drug-induced orthostatic hypotension.
      Nortriptyline hydrochloride is an effective antidepressant that, in depressed
      patients without heart disease, causes significantly less orthostatic hypotension
      than imipramine. To see if this advantage could be safely extended to patients
      with congestive failure, we measured the effect of nortriptyline on ejection
      fraction and blood pressure in 21 depressed patients with left ventricular
      impairment. Ejection fraction was unchanged by nortriptyline treatment, and
      orthostatic hypotension developed in only one (5%) of 21 patients. Nortriptyline 
      emerges as a relatively safe treatment for depression in patients with left
      ventricular impairment.

TI  - Allergic sino-orbital mycosis. A clinical and immunologic study.
PG  - 3249-53
AB  - We present a case of pansinusitis with orbital involvement associated with an
      allergic response to the fungus Curvularia (Cochliobolus) lunata. Key elements to
      the diagnosis included a predominant eosinophilic response of the sinus mucosa,
      the presence of a characteristic mucoid exudate containing fungal hyphae,
      peripheral blood eosinophilia, serum precipitins against C lunata, elevated serum
      total and Curvularia-specific IgE and IgG concentrations, and immediate cutaneous
      reactivity to C lunata antigen. This report suggests that an exaggerated allergic
      response should be considered in the pathogenesis of pansinusitis. The presence
      of fungal hyphae in sinus mucosal specimens should alert the physician to the
      possibility of this disease. Sinus fungal cultures, as well as thorough
      immunologic evaluation, of such patients is recommended.

TI  - Metabolic effects of dietary fructose and sucrose in types I and II diabetic
      subjects.
PG  - 3241-6
AB  - To learn more about the metabolic effects of dietary fructose and sucrose, 12
      type I and 12 type II diabetic subjects were fed three isocaloric (or isoenergic)
      diets for eight days each according to a randomized, crossover design. The three 
      diets provided, respectively, 21% of the energy as fructose, 23% of the energy as
      sucrose, and almost all carbohydrate energy as starch. The fructose diet resulted
      in significantly lower one- and two-hour postprandial plasma glucose levels,
      overall mean plasma glucose levels, and urinary glucose excretion in both type I 
      and type II subjects than did the starch diet. There were no significant
      differences between the sucrose and starch diets in any of the measures of
      glycemic control in either subject group. The fructose and sucrose diets did not 
      significantly increase serum triglyceride values when compared with the starch
      diet, but both increased postprandial serum lactate levels. We conclude that
      short-term replacement of other carbohydrate sources in the diabetic diet with
      fructose will improve glycemic control, whereas replacement with sucrose will not
      aggravate glycemic control.

      Evaluation of Johnson & Johnson's Live for Life program.
PG  - 3235-40
AB  - This study explores the relationship between exposure to a comprehensive worksite
      health promotion program and health care costs and utilization. The experience of
      two groups of Johnson & Johnson employees (N = 5192 and N = 3259) exposed to Live
      for Life, a comprehensive program of health screens, life-style improvement
      programs, and worksite changes to support healthier life-styles, was compared
      with that of a control group (N = 2955) over a five-year period. To account for
      baseline differences, analyses of covariance produced adjusted means for
      inpatient hospital costs, admissions, hospital days, outpatient costs, and other 
      health costs. Mean annual inpatient cost increases were $43 and $42 for two Live 
      for Life groups vs $76 for the non-Live for Life group. Live for Life groups also
      had lower rates of increase in hospital days and admissions. No significant
      differences were found for outpatient or other health care costs.

TI  - National surveillance of AIDS in health care workers.
PG  - 3231-4
AB  - Information obtained for all persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
      (AIDS) reported to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, includes a question 
      about employment in a health care or clinical laboratory setting. As of May 1,
      1986, a total of 922 (5.5%) of 16,748 adults with AIDS reported employment in
      such settings. Ninety-five percent of these health care workers belonged to
      recognized high-risk groups for AIDS; the proportion with "no identified risk"
      has not increased with time. All AIDS patients (including health care workers)
      who do not belong to high-risk groups are referred for further investigation. Of 
      88 health care workers initially reported with no identified risk, ten were from 
      countries where heterosexual transmission is believed to play a major role;
      additional information was unobtainable or incomplete for 17 individuals. Of 61
      persons on whom interviews or other follow-up information was obtained, 44 (73%) 
      were reclassified. Specific occupational exposures that could be implicated as
      the source of human immunodeficiency virus infection were not identified for any 
      health care workers with AIDS. A review of surveillance data supports other
      studies indicating that the risk of human immunodeficiency virus transmission in 
      the occupational setting is low.

PG  - 3223-6
AB  - Although pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common serious infection among
      young women of reproductive age in the United States, no nationwide data are
      available on the patterns of antibiotic treatment of this disease. To examine
      these patterns we analyzed over 25 million antibiotic prescriptions for treatment
      of pelvic inflammatory disease from 1966 through 1983, using the National Disease
      and Therapeutic Index. Most patients received a single antibiotic on an
      outpatient basis. Overall, use of natural penicillins declined markedly, and use 
      of aminopenicillins more than doubled. Cephalosporins emerged as the most
      frequently prescribed antibiotic for hospitalized patients. Nationwide
      surveillance of treatment patterns may help to identify areas needing improvement
      through continuing education.

AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of
      chlorhexidine in human serum and urine was developed. Chlorhexidine and the
      internal standard, chlorpheniramine, were extracted into chloroform, containing
      5% 2-propanol, and back-extracted into dilute sulfuric acid. Chromatographic
      separation was achieved on a C18 column equilibrated with methanol-water (70:30, 
      v/v), containing 0.005 M sodium heptane-sulfonate. The sensitivity of the assay
      was 20 ng/ml of biological matrix, using 0.5-ml samples. The application of this 
      method to monitor chlorhexidine levels in burn patients treated topically with a 
      chlorhexidine-containing burn cream was demonstrated.

PG  - 357-64
AB  - A sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method
      for the determination of bupivacaine and its two metabolites, desbutyl- and
      4'-hydroxybupivacaine, in human serum and urine is described. Bupivacaine, both
      metabolites and the internal standard, etidocaine, are extracted with diethyl
      ether and then back-extracted into an acidic aqueous phase. After subsequent
      extraction into diethyl ether, evaporation and reconstitution in the mobile
      phase, bupivacaine and the metabolites are determined by HPLC using a
      reversed-phase C8 column with tetrahydrofuran-potassium phosphate buffer (8:92,
      v/v, pH 2.4) as the mobile phase. The sensitivity of the method is 10
      micrograms/l for bupivacaine and both metabolites and the extraction efficiencies
      are 95, 54 and 92% for bupivacaine and desbutyl- and 4'-hydroxybupivacaine,
      respectively. The reproducibility of the method is good, the coefficients of
      variation varying between 1.8 and 7.4% in the concentration range 0.10-2.00 mg/l.
      The procedure was applied to human serum and urine samples from two elderly women
      who had been operated on under epidural analgesia (plain bupivacaine, 1.5 mg/kg) 
      because of uterine prolapse.

      chromatography using automated column switching.
PG  - 349-55
AB  - A fully automated high-performance liquid chromatographic column-switching system
      is presented for the determination of cyclosporin A in whole blood. After blood
      proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile, the supernatant was automatically
      loaded on to a cyanopropyl column for initial separation, and then the fraction
      containing cyclosporin A was loaded on to a trimethylsilica column for final
      separation and quantitation. Cyclosporin A was detected by ultraviolet absorption
      at 205 nm. The minimum detectable concentration of cyclosporin A was 5 ng/ml in
      100 microliter of blood. The coefficient of variation of the method was 1.755,
      1.748 and 0.655% in whole blood when spiked at the 170, 425 and 850 ng/ml levels,
      respectively. One assay was completed in 15 min.

TI  - High-performance liquid chromatographic on-line flow-through radioactivity
      detector system for analyzing amino acids and metabolites labeled with
      nitrogen-13.
PG  - 325-37
AB  - A flow-through radioactivity detector was used for the high-performance liquid
      chromatographic determination of amino acids and other nitrogenous substances
      labeled with 13N, a short-lived (t1/2 9.96 min) positron-emitting radionuclide.
      13N-Labeled compounds were analyzed using cation, anion and amino columns, or as 
      the o-phthaldialdehyde derivative on an ODS column. Use of column-switching
      valves and a high-performance liquid chromatographic system with a quaternary
      eluting capability permits two to three 20-min analyses of labeled samples from a
      single 13N experiment to be carried out on different columns using a binary or a 
      single mobile phase. Radioactivity in liver metabolites was quantified using an
      on-line flow-through monitor with data processing capability for integrating
      peaks and correcting for radioactivity decay. As an example, 1 min following an
      L-[13N]glutamate injection via the hepatic portal vein, 77% of the label in the
      liver was in a metabolized form; at least ten labeled products were formed.

TI  - Determination of 2,3-dinor-6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha in urine samples by
      liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay.
PG  - 317-24
AB  - A method for 2,3-dinor-6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha quantification based on
      high-performance liquid chromatography-radioimmunoassay is described. Samples are
      acidified to pH 3 and processed through C18 disposable cartridges. The
      prostanoids are eluted with methyl formate and further separated on a
      reversed-phase column using acetonitrile-acetic acid-triethylamine buffer
      (32:68). Studies of the effect of eluent pH were performed in order to optimize
      resolution and separation of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha from other prostanoids. 
      Eluates were collected and assayed by radioimmunoassay using a heterologous
      system, with 6-keto-PGF1 alpha as radioligand and an antiserum with high
      cross-reactivity for 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Sensitivity, precision and
      accuracy of the assay procedure are reported together with the validation of its 
      specificity. The proposed method has been applied to the determination of this
      prostacyclin metabolite in human urine.

PG  - 297-305
AB  - A method to separate underivatized tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates within 
      20 min using the commonly available C15 high-performance liquid chromatography
      column has been developed. Ion pairing using tetrabutylammonium cations and
      isocratic conditions is used to separate the intermediates which are then
      detected at 210 nm. Separation was optimized by altering pH, the concentration of
      sodium sulfate and the pairing ion. This technique permits the detection of as
      little as 120 nmol of citrate to 0.5 nmol of fumarate. Physiological samples of
      rat liver mitochondria, human urine, and orange juice were analyzed.

TI  - Determination of plasma amino acids by gas chromatography.
PG  - 281-95
AB  - A complete methodology, incorporating a novel clean-up technique, for
      quantitative determination of amino acids in plasma by gas chromatography is
      described. Glucose, a component causing major analytical interference, is removed
      by an enzymic reaction included in the pre-chromatographic clean-up. The
      procedure for derivatisation of amino acid standards is shown to be reproducible 
      down to a level of 2.5 micrograms for each amino acid, relative standard
      deviations for all amino acids except arginine and histidine being 3% or lower.
      For the entire procedure applied to plasma, relative standard deviations for most
      amino acids are below 5% with recoveries ranging from 90 to 120%. Normal values, 
      obtained using eighteen plasma samples, are in reasonable agreement with
      published data. Plasma amino acid values were determined simultaneously by gas
      chromatographic and ion-exchange chromatographic techniques. Statistical
      evaluation shows there to be no significant difference between corresponding
      values for eleven amino acids. Values for tyrosine, histidine and particularly
      phenylalanine show significant differences (p less than 0.001).

AB  - Sensitive methods for the determination of deuterated and non-deuterated
      tryptophan, tryptamine and serotonin by combined capillary gas chromatography and
      negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry were developed.
      [3,3-2H2]-L-Tryptophan, which was used as a tracer, was synthesized for studies
      of their in vivo metabolism. Tryptophan was converted into its
      trifluoroacetylmethyl derivative after prepurification with an AG 50W-X2
      cation-exchange column. Tryptamine and serotonin were extracted with 20% butanol 
      in diethyl ether and derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride. These
      derivatives were separated and determined by selected ion monitoring. In these
      determinations, [2',3,3,4',5',6',7'-2H7]-D,L-tryptophan,
      [alpha,alpha,beta,beta-2H4]tryptamine and [alpha,alpha,beta,beta-2H4]serotonin

TI  - Sensitive analysis of blood for amodiaquine and three metabolites by
      high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
PG  - 375-86
AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic method using oxidative electrochemical 
      detection has been developed for selective and sensitive quantification of the
      antimalarial drug amodiaquine and three of its metabolites in the blood of dosed 
      individuals. The method requires only one extraction step and has detection
      limits of 1 ng/ml for amodiaquine and its metabolites desethylamodiaquine and
      bisdesethylamodiaquine and 3 ng/ml for 2-hydroxydesethylamodiaquine. Minor
      modification of the mobile phase preserves the chromatographic separation and
      allows ultraviolet spectroscopic detection, which, although appreciably less
      sensitive, permits monitoring of levels of amodiaquine and the three metabolites 
      in blood and urine samples if an electrochemical detector is unavailable. Levels 
      of amodiaquine and the three metabolites were determined for two volunteers
      undergoing a nine-week chemoprophylactic regimen in connection with travel to a
      malarious area. Data are included to compare the in vitro antimalarial activities
      against three strains of Plasmodium falciparum of amodiaquine and the three
      metabolites considered.

AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection
      has been developed to measure norepinephrine (NE) and alpha-methylnorepinephrine 
      (alpha-MeNE) in microdissected noradrenergic cell groups of the rabbit brain
      stem. The method is shown to be specific, accurate and precise and has a
      sensitivity of 0.5 pmol per sample. The method has been applied to the
      measurement of NE and alpha-MeNE levels in the A1, A2, A5, A6 and A7
      noradrenergic cell groups after administration of the antihypertensive drug
      alpha-methyldopa (alpha-MD), so that the sites of action of alpha-MD within the
      central nervous system may be localised.

TI  - [Liver transplantation--indications and postoperative course].
PG  - 838-42
AB  - 54 liver transplantations on 53 patients are analysed. Tumor disease was found in
      57%, cirrhotic liver disease in 43%. 9 patients had metastatic liver tumors after
      distal colon surgery. The fatal technical failure rate was 3%, the postoperative 
      mortality for the first 3 month and for 1 year 40% and 52% respectively. Very
      often jaundice and rejection in the graft were found, independent from the
      crossmatch (pos. in 16%). There is only one child with 3 years. The main reason
      for postoperative death are lung and heart diseases, which were not diagnosed
      preoperatively in 10 patients. We conclude that the postoperative complication
      rate is to be lowered by applying rigorous selection criteria, raising the
      replantation rate and improving the donor organisation.

TI  - [Measuring cyclosporin in immunosuppressive treatment following liver and heart
      transplantation].
PG  - 820-4
AB  - Selective suppression of the immune system in graft recipients is now achieved in
      most cases by treatment with cyclosporine A. Due to large individual differences 
      in absorption, utilization and metabolisation of this drug, therapeutic blood
      levels (immunosuppression/toxicity) can be maintained only by frequent
      measurements of the cyclosporine concentrations in blood samples and dosage
      readjustments. In the present study, we measured cyclosporine in whole blood
      samples from 37 patients (23 liver and 14 heart transplant recipients) using an
      high pressure liquid chromatographic method for native cyclosporine A which has
      been developed in our laboratory and a radioimmunoassay method (cyclosporine A + 
      metabolites). By comparison of the results of HPLC and RIA-measurements (n = 520)
      we found a relatively stable metabolization rate (RIA/HPLC-ratio) of 4.23 +/-
      1.30 for heart transplant recipients. In contrast RIA/HPLC ratios were highly
      variable in liver graft recipients ranging from 1.3-9 for the same patient in the
      posttransplant period. The liver recipients could be classified into two groups
      according to their mean RIA/HPLC-ratios: for 11 patients we observed a mean ratio
      of 2.65 +/- 0.35, for another 12 patients one of 4.35 +/- 0.75. Lower
      metabolisation rates seem to be associated with low donor age. No direct
      correlation was found between changes in RIA/HPLC-ratios and liver function,
      rejection and infection periods. Rejection treatment with high doses of
      methylprednisolone had no systematic influence on cyclosporine metabolisation in 
      our patients. Since cyclosporine metabolites, at least those ones which are most 
      abundant, have less immunosuppressive and toxic effects we recommend measurements
      of cyclosporine blood concentrations with any HPLC-method specific for the
      unchanged drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Effects of cholesterol and lipoproteins on endocytosis by a monocyte-like cell
      line.
PG  - 287-300
AB  - The human monocyte/macrophage-like cell line U937 is a cholesterol auxotroph.
      Incubation of these cells in the growth medium in which delipidated fetal calf
      serum has been substituted for fetal calf serum depletes cellular cholesterol and
      inhibits growth. The cholesterol requirement of these cells for growth can be
      satisfied by human low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very-low-density
      lipoprotein (VLDL), but not by high-density lipoprotein (HDL). U937 cells can
      bind and degrade LDL via a high-affinity site and this recognition is altered by 
      acetylation of LDL. This indicates that these cells express relatively high LDL
      receptor activity and low levels of the acetyl-LDL receptor. The cells were used 
      to study the role of cholesterol in lectin-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis. 
      Growth of the cells in the medium containing delipidated fetal calf serum results
      in impairment of both concanavalin A-mediated endocytosis of horseradish
      peroxidase and concanavalin A-independent endocytosis of Lucifer Yellow.
      Supplementation of the medium with cholesterol prevents cellular cholesterol
      depletion, supports growth and stimulates Lucifer Yellow endocytosis but fails to
      restore horseradish peroxidase endocytosis. However, if the cells are incubated
      in the presence of no less than 40 micrograms LDL protein/ml to maintain normal
      cell cholesterol levels, concanavalin A-mediated endocytosis of horseradish
      peroxidase is activated. The effect of LDL is specific since neither VLDL nor
      HDL3 at the same protein concentration activates horseradish peroxidase uptake by
      the cells. Furthermore, the activation of endocytosis by LDL is not inhibited by 
      the inclusion of heparin or acetylation of the LDL indicating that binding of LDL
      to the LDL receptor is not required for these effects. The mediation of
      activation of horseradish peroxidase endocytosis by the lectin is presumed to
      involve binding of LDL to concanavalin A associated with the cell surface which
      in turn stimulates horseradish peroxidase binding and uptake by adsorptive
      endocytosis. The rate of fluid endocytosis and endosome formation seems to depend
      on cellular cholesterol content presumably because cholesterol is involved in
      maintaining the appropriate plasma membrane structure and fluidity.

TI  - Separation of large DNA molecules by contour-clamped homogeneous electric fields.
PG  - 1582-5
AB  - Electric fields can be manipulated by a method in which multiple electrodes are
      arranged along a closed contour and clamped to predetermined electric potentials.
      This method may be applied to a broad range of problems in the separation of
      macromolecules by gel electrophoresis. DNA molecules as large as 2 megabases can 
      be well separated with a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field alternating
      between two orientations 120 degrees apart. The pattern of separation is
      independent of position in the gel, which is an advantage over previous methods. 
      DNA less than 50 kilobases can be separated without distortion even at high
      voltage with a nonalternating contour-clamped homogeneous field. Decreased band
      broadening in DNA less than 200 bases can be achieved with a contour-clamped
      inhomogeneous field.

TI  - Regulation of lipoprotein lipase synthesis and 3T3-L1 adipocyte metabolism by
      recombinant interleukin 1.
PG  - 374-81
AB  - When fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to purified, recombinant
      murine interleukin 1 (rIL-1), a dose-dependent suppression of lipoprotein lipase 
      activity was observed. The loss of activity reached a maximum of 60-70% of
      control and appeared to be due to an effect on the synthesis of the enzyme as
      judged by a suppression of the ability to incorporate [35S]methionine into
      immunoprecipitable lipoprotein lipase. There was no general effect on protein
      synthesis as determined by radiolabel incorporation into acid precipitable
      protein; however, after a 17 h exposure of the 3T3-L1 cells to recombinant
      interleukin 1, the synthesis of two proteins (molecular weights, 19,400 and
      165,000 daltons) was enhanced several-fold. When the effect of Il-1 on the major 
      metabolic pathways of the adipocyte was investigated, lipolysis as measured by
      glycerol release from the cells was markedly enhanced after a 17 h incubation
      with the hormone, while no effect was observed on de novo fatty acid synthesis.
      These effects on the metabolism of the adipocytes occur at concentration on a
      basis of molecules per cell, similar (only a 3-fold difference) to those required
      for stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into mouse thymocyte DNA,
      suggesting that IL-1 may be a physiologically significant effector of adipocyte
      metabolism.

TI  - Two different cis-active elements transfer the transcriptional effects of both

PG  - 1552-7
AB  - Short cis-active sequences of the rat prolactin or Moloney murine leukemia virus 
      genes transfer transcriptional regulation by both epidermal growth factor and
      phorbol esters to fusion genes. These sequences act in a position- and
      orientation-independent manner. Competitive binding analyses with nuclear
      extracts from stimulated and unstimulated cells suggest that different
      trans-acting factors associate with the regulatory sequence of each gene. A model
      is proposed suggesting that both epidermal growth factor and phorbol esters
      stimulate the transcription of responsive genes via discrete classes of
      hormone-dependent, enhancer-like elements that bind different trans-acting
      factors, even in the absence of hormone stimulation.

      the measurement of putrescine oxidation by human plasma.
PG  - 271-80
AB  - A convenient and sensitive method for the determination of 15NH3 has been
      developed. Ammonia was purified from sample solutions by a modified
      microdiffusion method, derivatized with pentafluorobenzoyl chloride to
      pentafluorobenzamide (PFBA) and determined by gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry using a multiple ion detector. PFBA was eluted from the gas
      chromatographic column within 2 min and resulted in a simple mass fragmentation
      pattern. The 15N/14N ratio was accurately determined with picomole amounts of
      PFBA by measuring the molecular ions of PFBA and [15N]PFBA. The method was
      applied to the assay of putrescine oxidation by human plasma. 15NH3 was produced 
      by incubating 15N-labelled putrescine with plasma. The 15NH3 production was time 
      dependent and strongly inhibited by the addition of aminoguanidine, an inhibitor 
      of diamine oxidase. Exceedingly high 15NH3 production from [15N]putrescine was
      observed in the plasma from pregnant women. In contrast, only trace amounts of
      15NH3 were formed in the plasma from normal men and non-pregnant women. The
      method seems to be applicable to various biological systems that produce ammonia 
      as a metabolic product.

TI  - [Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with radical resection of stomach cancer:
      5-year results of a prospective randomized study].
PG  - 824-30
AB  - 102 patients with operable gastric carcinoma were randomly allocated to untreated
      control, polychemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy. At a median follow-up of 5 years, 
      chemotherapy did not improve the overall survival rate. However, in certain
      subgroups, patients with lymphnode metastases and intestinal tumor type showed a 
      significant survival benefit when treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
      Furthermore, we found the site of first recurrence very closely related to the
      type of tumor histology. Regardless of the positive effect of chemotherapy in
      retrospective subset-analysis, we do not generally recommend the use of
      polychemotherapy in operable gastric carcinoma.

TI  - Thyroid hormone induction of an autocrine growth factor secreted by pituitary
      tumor cells.
PG  - 1549-52
AB  - Thyroid hormones stimulate the rate of cell division by poorly understood
      mechanisms. The possibility that thyroid hormones increase cell growth by
      stimulating secretion of a growth factor was investigated. Thyroid hormones are
      nearly an absolute requirement for the division of GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor
      cells plated at low density. Conditioned media from cells grown with or without
      L-triiodothyronine (T3) were treated with an ion exchange resin to remove T3 and 
      were tested for ability to stimulate the division of GH4C1 cells. Conditioned
      medium from T3-treated cells was as active as thyroid hormone at promoting GH4C1 
      cell growth but did not elicit other thyroid hormone responses, induction of
      growth hormone, and down-regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors,
      as effectively as T3 did. A substance or substances associated with T3-induced
      growth stimulatory activity migrated at high molecular weight at neutral pH and
      was different from known growth-promoting hormones induced by T3. The results
      demonstrate that thyroid hormones stimulate the division of GH4C1 pituitary cells
      by stimulating the secretion of an autocrine growth factor.

TI  - Surreptitious insulin administration in adolescents with insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 3227-30
AB  - Six adolescents, 12 to 15 years old, with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
      were discovered to be secretively taking extra insulin, not with the intent of
      improving metabolic control. Large discrepancies between reported and observed
      insulin requirements were noted. Psychosocial problems antedated the discovery of
      surreptitious insulin administration in all. Psychological testing and
      psychiatric evaluation revealed a variety of psychiatric conditions; depression
      was common. In two patients surreptitious insulin administration was believed to 
      represent suicidal behavior. In others, it appeared to represent symptom
      substitution when use of other health-threatening behaviors such as recurrent
      ketoacidosis was made increasingly difficult through appropriate intervention.
      Surreptitious insulin administration may be one symptom of serious underlying
      psychiatric dysfunction in adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes.

TI  - [Therapy of primary resistant or recurrent small cell bronchial carcinoma with
      vindesine and ifosfamide].
PG  - 1961-6
AB  - A combination of vindesine (3 mg/m2, day 1) and ifosfamide (60 mg/kg, days 1-5 + 
      Mesna) was administered every three weeks to 11 patients with primary resistant
      and 23 with recurrent small-cell bronchial carcinoma. All patients had been
      pre-treated with chemotherapy, 16 in addition with radiotherapy. At the onset of 
      the vindesine-ifosfamide treatment the cancer was in a localized regional stage
      in ten patients, while in 24 it was in a more widely spread stage. In 29 patients
      whose treatment results could be evaluated the remission rate was 38%, with two
      complete and nine partial remissions. In a further eight patients the cancer was 
      arrested. The patients with complete remission (for 46 and 53 weeks,
      respectively), those with partial remission (median of 39 weeks) and those with
      stationary disease (median of 31 weeks) survived significantly longer than those 
      with progressing disease (13 weeks). There was no correlation between treatment
      result and pre-treatment. On recurrence after complete remission or in the
      localized regional stage the remission rate was 70% and 60%, respectively, and
      the survival time was extended in 90% of cases. In addition to nausea, alopecia
      and myelosuppression, side-effects included vomiting, reversible CNS symptoms,
      polyneuropathy and urotoxicity. On the basis of acceptable toxicity, combined
      vindesine and ifosfamide constitute an effective treatment of otherwise
      treatment-refractory cases of small-cell bronchial carcinoma.

      immunohistochemical and biochemical studies].
PG  - 1954-60
AB  - Comparative biochemical and immunohistochemical investigations on receptors were 
      performed on 100 breast cancers of different types. The biochemical analysis was 
      carried out by means of radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemical detection 
      was performed with monoclonal antibodies against nuclear receptor protein
      (ER-ICA, Abbott Lab.). The semiquantitative evaluation is based on a histological
      score considering a graduated staining intensity and the percentage of positively
      reacting cells. The results of the two methods corresponded in 92% in positive
      and in 68% in negative receptor detection. The age-dependence is confirmed. The
      nuclear grading and histological grading show that the number of estrogen
      receptors gradually decreases with increasing degree of malignancy of the
      carcinomas. The advantage of immunohistochemical receptor assay consists in the
      microscopic investigation of homogeneous and heterogeneous degrees of intensity
      as well as in the possibility of determining receptor status in very small breast
      cancers, in punch biopsies and in tumours in which the tumour parenchyma is
      largely necrotic, sclerosed or surrounded by large amounts of mucus.

TI  - The effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the excretion of taurocholic acid from
      isolated rat liver cells.
PG  - 382-5
AB  - Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (50-1000 microM) was found to increase the initial rate of
      efflux of taurocholic acid from isolated rat hepatocytes. Efflux of the bile acid
      was inhibited by sodium, and in the absence of sodium dibutyryl cyclic AMP failed
      to stimulate the rate. Increasing the concentration of calcium from 0 to 1.2 mM
      had no effect on the initial rate of taurocholic acid efflux from the cells, but 
      the absence of calcium markedly reduced the effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The
      results suggest that changes in the fluxes of sodium and calcium are involved in 
      the effect of the cyclic nucleotide on taurocholic acid efflux from the cells.

TI  - Cytoplasmic pH regulation in activated human neutrophils: effects of adenosine
      and pertussis toxin on Na+/H+ exchange and metabolic acidification.
PG  - 301-9
AB  - When stimulated, neutrophils undergo a complex change in cytoplasmic pH (pHi): an
      incipient acidification, followed by an alkalinization which is due to activation
      of Na+/H+ exchange. When the latter is inhibited by amiloride or by removal of
      extracellular Na+, the actual magnitude of the initial acidification can be fully
      appreciated. The acidification is thought to be of metabolic origin, but the
      precise origin of the H+ (equivalents) remains undefined. We used adenosine, a
      modulator of neutrophil responsiveness, to identify the source of metabolic acid 
      in cells stimulated by either formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe)
      or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Pretreatment of the cells with
      adenosine inhibited the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced respiratory burst, but secretion of 
      specific and azurophilic granules, as well as aggregation were unaffected. In
      fMet-Leu-Phe-treated cells, adenosine reduced the acidification recorded in
      Na+-free media, but had no effect on the activation of the Na+/H+ antiport.
      Adenosine had little or no effect on the TPA-induced responses, including the pHi
      changes. The respiratory burst, as well as the cytoplasmic acidification were
      also inhibited in parallel by pretreating the cells with 'islet-activating
      protein' from Bordetella pertussis. It was concluded that activation of the
      NADPH-oxidase and/or the associated stimulation of the hexose monophosphate shunt
      play a major role in the metabolic acidification of stimulated neutrophils.

TI  - The effect of oxidants on neutrophil-mediated degradation of glomerular basement 
      membrane collagen.
PG  - 277-86
AB  - The contribution of activated oxygen species to neutrophil-mediated degradation
      of basement membrane collagen was investigated. In preliminary experiments,
      pre-exposure of either albumin or glomerular basement membrane to neutrophil
      myeloperoxidase with H2O2 and chloride increased their susceptibility to
      proteolysis 2-3-fold. In the basement membrane model, neutrophils are stimulated 
      by trapped immune complexes to adhere, produce oxidants and degranulate.
      Degradation, measured as the amount of hydroxyproline solubilised, was due to
      neutral proteinases, particularly elastase, and depended on cell number and the
      amount of proteinase released. Experiments with oxidant scavengers and inhibitors
      and with neutrophils from donors with chronic granulomatous disease or
      myeloperoxidase deficiency showed that oxidants did not affect degradation of the
      basement membrane when this was measured on a per cell basis. However, oxidative 
      inactivation of the released granule enzymes occurred. Activities of elastase,
      beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme were 1.5-2-times higher in the presence of
      catalase, but were unaffected by superoxide dismutase or hydroxyl radical
      scavengers. Inactivation did not occur with chronic granulomatous disease or
      myeloperoxidase deficient neutrophils. When related to the activity of released
      elastase, or to other degranulation markers, collagen degradation was decreased
      in the presence of catalase, or with chronic granulomatous disease or
      myeloperoxidase deficient cells. This implies that the basement membrane was made
      more digestible by myeloperoxidase-derived oxidants, as occurred in the cell-free
      experiments. Taken together, the results indicate that neutrophil oxidants have
      two opposing effects. They increase the susceptibility of the collagen to
      proteolysis and inactivate the proteinases responsible.

TI  - Structure of the DNA-Eco RI endonuclease recognition complex at 3 A resolution.
PG  - 1526-41
AB  - The crystal structure of the complex between Eco RI endonuclease and the cognate 
      oligonucleotide TCGCGAATTCGCG provides a detailed example of the structural basis
      of sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions. The structure was determined, to 3
      A resolution, by the ISIR (iterative single isomorphous replacement) method with 
      a platinum isomorphous derivative. The complex has twofold symmetry. Each subunit
      of the endonuclease is organized into an alpha/beta domain consisting a
      five-stranded beta sheet, alpha helices, and an extension, called the "arm,"
      which wraps around the DNA. The large beta sheet consists of antiparallel and
      parallel motifs that form the foundations for the loops and alpha helices
      responsible for DNA strand scission and sequence-specific recognition,
      respectively. The DNA cleavage site is located in a cleft that binds the DNA
      backbone in the vicinity of the scissile bond. Sequence specificity is mediated
      by 12 hydrogen bonds originating from alpha helical recognition modules. Arg200
      forms two hydrogen bonds with guanine while Glu144 and Arg145 form four hydrogen 
      bonds to adjacent adenine residues. These interactions discriminate the Eco RI
      hexanucleotide GAATTC from all other hexanucleotides because any base
      substitution would require rupture of at least one of these hydrogen bonds.

TI  - The metabolism of phosphoinositide-derived messenger molecules.
PG  - 1519-26
AB  - The phosphoinositides are minor phospholipids present in all eukaryotic cells.
      They are storage forms for messenger molecules that transmit signals across the
      cell membrane and evoke responses to extracellular agonists. The
      phosphoinositides break down to liberate messenger molecules or precursors of
      messenger molecules. Many different compounds are formed, although the functions 
      of only a few are understood. Recent studies elaborating the pathways for
      formation of products from phosphoinositides and the factors controlling their
      metabolism are summarized here.

TI  - Permeability properties of isolated enterocytes from rat small intestine.
PG  - 361-5
AB  - Metabolic and permeability properties of enterocytes isolated by treatment of rat
      small intestine with hyaluronidase or EDTA were compared. No significant
      difference was observed in the ability of the two types of cell to produce
      lactate from glucose. However, while cells obtained with hyaluronidase accumulate
      alpha-methylglucoside, cells obtained with EDTA were unable to accumulate the
      sugar above the medium concentrations. When resuspended in a medium designed to
      resemble the intracellular medium, potentiometric measurements showed that cells 
      obtained with hyaluronidase released Ca2+ to the medium while cells obtained with
      EDTA accumulated it. Using 45Ca transport assays, this was shown to be an
      ATP-dependent process, the accumulated 45Ca being totally released by the
      addition of the ionophore A23187. When cells obtained with EDTA were resuspended 
      in a medium containing concentrations of free Ca2+ higher that 10 microM, the
      uptake was partially inhibited by sodium orthovanadate and also by oligomycin and
      antimycin. At free Ca2+ concentrations lower than 1 microM, the accumulation was 
      inhibited up to 87% by sodium orthovanadate while mitochondrial inhibitors
      inhibited only 5%. Thus, it appears that during their preparation cells obtained 
      with hyaluronidase retain their integrity while cells obtained with EDTA become
      permeable to Ca2+ and other ions. The usefulness of both types of preparation in 
      metabolic and transport studies is discussed.

TI  - Effect of light and calcium on cyclic GMP synthesis in rod outer segments of toad
      retina.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - The rod outer segments of toad retina contain a guanylate cyclase activity of
      about 3 +/- 1 nmol of cGMP formed/min per mg protein. In darkness this value is
      largely independent of the Ca2+ concentration, although it is enhanced by light
      upon lowering the Ca2+ concentration from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M. The activating
      effect of light on cyclase at low Ca2+ concentrations is enlarged upon increasing
      the light intensity. With a flash of light bleaching 7 X 10(-2) percent of
      rhodopsin, cyclase activity increased by a factor of 30 when Ca2+ levels dropped 
      from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M. In view of recent observations that shortly after a
      flash of light the calcium activity inside the photoreceptor cell decreases, it
      seems likely that Ca2+ plays a regulatory role on cGMP metabolism in visual
      excitation.

TI  - Positron emission tomography reveals elevated D2 dopamine receptors in drug-naive
      schizophrenics.
PG  - 1558-63
AB  - In postmortem studies of patients with schizophrenia, D2 dopamine receptors in
      the basal ganglia have been observed to be more numerous than in patients with no
      history of neurological or psychiatric disease. Because most patients with
      schizophrenia are treated with neuroleptic drugs that block D2 dopamine receptors
      in the caudate nucleus, it has been suggested that this increase in the number of
      receptors is a result of adaptation to these drugs rather than a biochemical
      abnormality intrinsic to schizophrenia. With positron emission tomography (PET), 
      the D2 dopamine receptor density in the caudate nucleus of living human beings
      was measured in normal volunteers and in two groups of patients with
      schizophrenia--one group that had never been treated with neuroleptics and
      another group that had been treated with these drugs. D2 dopamine receptor
      densities in the caudate nucleus were higher in both groups of patients than in
      the normal volunteers. Thus, schizophrenia itself is associated with an increase 
      in brain D2 dopamine receptor density.

TI  - Regulation of the secretion of lipoprotein lipase by mouse macrophages.
PG  - 346-54
AB  - The regulation of the secretion of lipoprotein lipase was studied in primary
      cultures of mouse peritoneal macrophages and in the murine macrophage cell line
      J774. As previously reported, both cell types secrete a lipase with the
      characteristics of lipoprotein lipase. Incubation of macrophages with insulin,
      insulin-like growth factor, and L-thyroxine had no effect on lipoprotein lipase
      secretion. Incubation with dexamethasone and with several agents which increase
      intracellular cyclic AMP led to a decrease in lipoprotein lipase secretion by
      mouse peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest that the hormonal regulation 
      of lipoprotein lipase in macrophages is different from that in adipose tissue and
      heart muscle. Incubation of the macrophages with heparin caused a marked increase
      in the secretion of lipoprotein lipase. Short incubations with heparin (5 min)
      caused a release of the enzyme into the media, while longer incubations caused a 
      2-8-fold increase in net lipoprotein lipase secretion which was maximal after
      2-16 h depending on cell type, and persisted for 24 h. The effect of heparin was 
      dose-dependent and specific (it was not duplicated by other glycosaminoglycans). 
      The mechanism of heparin-induced increase in lipoprotein lipase secretion was
      explored. The increase was not caused by the release of a presynthesized
      intracellular pool of lipoprotein lipase or by the stabilization of lipoprotein
      lipase by heparin after secretion. The heparin-induced increase in lipoprotein
      lipase secretion was dependent on protein synthesis. The secretion of lipoprotein
      lipase by macrophages in response to low levels of heparin may be a significant
      factor in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions.

TI  - Calcium concentration and amylase secretion in guinea pig pancreatic acini:
      interactions between carbachol, cholecystokinin octapeptide and the phorbol
      ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate.
PG  - 326-33
AB  - The effects of the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on
      amylase secretion and cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were
      investigated in dispersed guinea pig pancreatic acini. Carbachol evoked
      dose-dependent increases in amylase secretion and [Ca2+]i with half-maximal
      responses at 2.5 and 5 microM, respectively. Carbachol-induced calcium transients
      could be blocked by atropine. In the presence of a maximal effective dose of
      carbachol, cholecystokinin octapeptide caused no further increase in [Ca2+]i,
      suggesting that both agonists act on the same pool of trigger calcium. TPA
      (10(-9)-10(-6) M) stimulated amylase secretion with no change in [Ca2+]i. Maximum
      amylase secretion occurred at 0.5 microM TPA. Preincubation of acini in the
      presence of TPA resulted in a time- and dose-dependent inhibition (IC50 = 30 nM) 
      of the carbachol-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, the maximal effect being observed
      within 3 min. The inactive phorbol ester, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate was
      ineffective in inhibiting the carbachol-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i. These
      findings suggest that, in addition to stimulating amylase secretion, probably
      through protein kinase C, TPA may also exert a negative feedback control over
      secretagogue-induced calcium transients.

TI  - Binding of polycation DEAE-dextran to Chinese hamster ovary cells induces
      reversible Ca2+ influx and inhibits capping of concanavalin A acceptor proteins.
PG  - 316-25
AB  - Binding of the polycation DEAE-dextran to the cell surface of HA-1 CHO cells
      caused a marked increase in 45Ca2+ exchange influx. The effect was fairly
      selective for Ca2+, undirectional (efflux was not increased) and was rapidly
      reversed by treatment with polyanion dextran sulfate. 45Ca2+ influx could not be 
      stimulated by treatment with multivalent lectins or fibronectin. In addition to
      stimulating 45Ca2+ flux, DEAE-dextran inhibited the capping of concanavalin-A
      acceptor proteins. Inhibition of capping occurred over the same DEAE-dextran
      concentration range (20-200 micrograms/ml) which stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake,
      possibly implicating increased cellular [Ca2+] in the inhibition of concanavalin 
      A acceptor protein capping in this cell type. The profound effect of DEAE-dextran
      on cellular Ca2+ uptake and the rapid reversal of the effect by dextran sulfate
      might make the polycation a useful agent for the induction of transient increases
      in cellular [Ca2+].

TI  - CD8+ lymphocytes can control HIV infection in vitro by suppressing virus
      replication.
PG  - 1563-6
AB  - Lymphocytes bearing the CD8 marker were shown to suppress replication of human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect
      was dose-dependent and most apparent with autologous lymphocytes; it did not
      appear to be mediated by a cytotoxic response. This suppression of HIV
      replication could be demonstrated by the addition of CD8+ cells at the initiation
      of virus production as well as after several weeks of virus replication by
      cultured cells. The observations suggest a potential approach to therapy in which
      autologous CD8 lymphocytes could be administered to individuals to inhibit HIV
      replication and perhaps progression of disease.

TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis reveals role of mobile arginine residue in lactate
      dehydrogenase catalysis.
PG  - 699-702
AB  - The binding of substrates to lactate dehydrogenases induces a marked
      rearrangement of the protein structure in which a 'loop' of polypeptide (residues
      98-110) closes over the active site of the enzyme. In this rearrangement,
      arginine 109 (a basic residue conserved in all known lactate dehydrogenase
      sequences and in the homologous malate dehydrogenases) moves 0.8 nm from a
      position in the solvent to one in the active site where its guanidinium group
      resides within hydrogen bonding distance of both the reactive carbonyl of
      pyruvate and imidazole ring of the catalytic histidine 195 (see Fig. 1). Whilst
      this feature of the enzyme has been commented upon previously, the function of
      this mobile arginine residue during catalysis has not been tested experimentally.
      The advent of protein engineering has now enabled us to define the role of this
      basic residue by substituting it with the neutral glutamine. Transient kinetic
      and equilibrium studies of the mutant enzyme indicate that arginine 109 enhances 
      the polarization of the pyruvate carbonyl group in the ground state and
      stabilizes the transition state. The gross active-site structure of the enzyme is
      not altered by the mutation since an alternative catalytic function of the enzyme
      (rate of addition of sulphite to NAD+), which does not require hydride transfer, 
      is insensitive to the arginine----glutamine substitution.

TI  - EXAFS study of the zinc-binding sites in the protein transcription factor IIIA.
PG  - 698-9
AB  - The protein transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) is involved in the synthesis of 5S
      RNA in vitro by RNA polymerase III. It can be isolated from Xenopus laevis
      oocytes as a 7S particle in which the protein is associated with 5S RNA. Recently
      it has been shown that the native particle contains 7-11 zinc atoms. Analysis of 
      the amino-acid sequence of TFIIIA revealed nine similar domains of approximately 
      30 amino acids, each containing two invariant pairs of histidines and cysteines, 
      which have been implicated as possible binding sites for the zinc atoms. Other
      regulatory proteins with sequence homology to the zinc-binding domains of TFIIIA 
      have now been reported. Here, we report the results of an EXAFS (extended X-ray
      absorption fine structure) study of TFIIIA which shows that the coordination
      sphere of the zinc sites consists of two cysteine and two histidine residues.

TI  - Uracil-DNA glycosylase activity from Dictyostelium discoideum.
PG  - 262-4
AB  - We have isolated and partially characterized a uracil-DNA glycosylase activity
      from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. This glycosylase has a
      broad pH optimum (6.5-8.5) and is fully active in 10 mM EDTA or in 5 mM Mg2+. Its
      molecular weight by gel filtration is about 55 000. This enzyme activity may work
      in concert with previously described apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease
      activities in the excision repair of uracil from the DNA of this lower eukaryote.

TI  - Daunorubicin-induced DNA lesions in isolated rat hepatocytes and mammary
      epithelial cells.
PG  - 254-61
AB  - Daunorubicin, an anticancer drug, induces primarily mammary adenocarcinoma in
      Sprague-Dawley rats. We investigated daunorubicin-induced DNA lesions in
      enzymatically isolated mammary epithelial cells and hepatocytes from 7-8-week-old
      female Sprague-Dawley rats. Differences were observed in the type and quantity of
      DNA lesions in mammary epithelial cells and hepatocytes as determined by alkaline
      elution analysis. DNA single-strand breaks and proteinase-K-sensitive
      cross-linking lesions were observed in mammary epithelial cells. Hepatocytes
      appeared to have significantly lower relative frequencies of single-strand breaks
      than mammary epithelial cells when treated with daunorubicin (1.5-10.0
      micrograms/10(6) cells). Hepatocytes displayed two types of cross-link. One form 
      was sensitive to proteinase-K digestion, whereas the other form was insensitive. 
      The metabolism of daunorubicin to the aglycone metabolites was substantially
      lower in mammary cells than in hepatocytes. However, the total uptake of the drug
      was similar in these two cell types. A metabolite, 7-deoxydaunorubicinol
      aglycone, was unable to induce single-strand breaks or cross-linking lesions in
      mammary epithelial cells. Both cell types exhibited a similar ability to repair
      radiation-induced single-strand breaks of DNA. However, the mammary cells may be 
      less able to repair daunorubicin-mediated DNA damage. These results revealed that
      mammary epithelial cells are less able to metabolize the active
      mutagen/carcinogen, daunorubicin, than are hepatocytes. This, coupled with the
      observations of greater apparent DNA damage in mammary cells, may be of primary
      importance in the drug-induced carcinogenicity in the rat mammary tissue.

TI  - Photolabeling of protein components in the pactamycin binding site of rat liver
      ribosomes.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - The antitumoral and antibacterial drug pactamycin can be radioactively labeled by
      iodination without loss of biological activity. Using the labeled pactamycin, the
      ribosomal binding site of the drug on rat liver ribosomes has been studied by
      affinity labeling techniques taking advantage of the photoreactive acetophenone
      group present in the molecule. When 40 S ribosomal subunits are labeled, one
      major spot of radioactivity is found associated to protein S25. In addition,
      weaker spots related to proteins S14/15, S10, S17 and S7 can also be detected in 
      the autoradiogram of the two-dimensional gel slab. Since pactamycin inhibits
      protein synthesis initiation, the proteins forming its binding site must be
      related to some step of this process. By comparison with results from pactamycin 
      affinity labeling of Escherichia coli ribosomes (Tejedor, F., Amils, R. and
      Ballesta, J.P.G. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3667-3672) these proteins could lie in
      the mRNA and initiation factors binding region of the rat liver ribosome.

PG  - 243-8
AB  - A fraction containing a transcription factor(s) of RNA polymerase II was prepared
      from a nuclear lysate of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and its binding to a
      promoter region of the adenovirus 2 major late gene was examined. Results showed 
      that this fraction contained a factor(s) binding to two distinct regions: a
      region including the 'TATA' box and another region further upstream. The upstream
      protected region was different from that reported to be protected by a HeLa cell 
      factor, suggesting species specificity of transcription factor(s) in DNA binding.

TI  - Changes in H1 content, nucleosome repeat lengths and DNA elongation under
      conditions of hydroxyurea treatment that reportedly facilitate gene
      amplification.
PG  - 226-37
AB  - Depletion of histone H1, changes in nucleosome repeat lengths, and extents of DNA
      elongation were investigated in synchronized Chinese hamster (line CHO) cells
      using the general conditions of hydroxyurea treatment that appear to increase the
      frequency of gene amplification, i.e., synchronized cultures of G1 cells were
      allowed to begin to enter S phase before treatment with hydroxyurea was effected 
      to retard DNA synthesis (Mariani, B.D. and Schimke, R.T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem.
      259, 1901-1910). During the time that synchronized G1 cells begin to enter S
      phase, there occur considerable synchrony decay and accumulation of new DNA that 
      increase with time before treatment with hydroxyurea is initiated. During
      exposure to hydroxyurea, there occur depletion of histone H1 and shortened repeat
      lengths for the DNA synthesized in the presence of hydroxyurea. In contrast, DNA 
      synthesized in S phase before exposure to hydroxyurea has essentially the same
      repeat lengths as bulk chromatin at both the time that hydroxyurea treatment is
      effected and after 6 h in its presence. Sedimentation measurements indicate that 
      the early replicating DNA undergoes considerable elongation both before and
      during 6 h of exposure to 0.3 mM hydroxyurea. Thus, nearly all of the early
      replicating DNA is elongated to greater than average replicon size under those
      conditions of hydroxyurea treatment that appear to favor gene amplification.
      Because the extents of DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression vary as functions
      of drug concentration, treatment times, and unknown factors (from experiment to
      experiment), it would appear that the parameters must be carefully monitored in
      each experiment if biochemical results are to be related to the position of cells
      in the growth cycle.

TI  - A family of fibronectin mRNAs in human normal and transformed cells.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - Previously, two fibronectin mRNAs, generated by alternative splicing of the extra
      domain (ED) and type III connecting segments (IIICS) sequences, have been
      described in a human transformed cell line and in human liver, respectively. We
      now report on a family of fibronectin mRNAs identified by Northern blotting
      analysis in two normal human fibroblast strains (HEL 299 and Flow 7000) and five 
      transformed cell lines (8387 and HT-1080, fibrosarcomas; G-361, melanoma; JEG-3, 
      choriocarcinoma; and RD, rhabdomyosarcoma). Seven different fibronectin mRNA
      forms with electrophoretic mobilities ranging between 8.6 and 7.7 kb were
      identified. Each cell line contains three (HEL 299, Flow 7000 and 8387) or two
      (HT-1080, G-361, JEG-3 and RD) fibronectin mRNAs species with characteristic
      size. In all cell lines we detected one fibronectin mRNA form which lacks the ED 
      sequence (ED- fibronectin mRNA) and one or two fibronectin mRNAs containing it
      (ED+ fibronectin mRNA). These data show that the presence of ED+ and ED-
      fibronectin mRNAs is a general feature of all cells tested. Moreover, the
      fibronectin mRNA pattern is characteristic of the cell type analyzed, suggesting 
      the occurrence of specifically programmed splicing mechanisms in each cell line.

TI  - Core transcription restores in vitro inhibition of protein synthesis induced by
      vaccinia virus.
PG  - 183-9
AB  - When Ehrlich acistes tumor cell lysate is incubated in the presence of vaccinia
      core, protein synthesis is impaired. However, when the same system is coupled
      with viral transcription, protein synthesis is restored. The reversal of
      endogenous protein synthesis is inhibited by actinomycin D, suggesting that de
      novo RNA synthesis is required for the reversal of total protein synthesis. When 
      the in vitro products of synthesis are analysed by polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis, two newly synthesized peptides which are not present in the
      noncoupled transcription-translation system are observed. These two peptides have
      molecular weights of 31 000 and 25 000, similar to viral early proteins.

TI  - The acidosis of cholera. Contributions of hyperproteinemia, lactic acidemia, and 
      hyperphosphatemia to an increased serum anion gap.
PG  - 1591-5
AB  - To study the metabolic acidosis that occurs during the diarrhea of cholera, we
      examined the serum anion gap in 21 patients with hypovolemic shock due to Vibrio 
      cholerae infection. Measurements of serum electrolytes, as well as divalent
      cations and the anionic contributions of serum proteins, lactate, phosphate, and 
      serum creatinine, were made at the time of admission, after rehydration, and
      during convalescence. At the time of admission, the mean serum concentration of
      sodium was 134.8 mmol (meq) per liter, that of chloride was 103.2 mmol per liter,
      and that of bicarbonate was 11.4 mmol per liter; the mean anion gap was 20.2 mmol
      per liter. The mean serum creatinine concentration was 2.48 mg per deciliter. The
      low serum bicarbonate level and the high serum anion gap were corrected by
      rehydration. The increased serum anion gap was caused by hyperproteinemia, lactic
      acidemia, and hyperphosphatemia, with anionic contributions to the rise in anion 
      gap estimated as protein, 5.5 meq per liter; lactate, 2.5 meq per liter; and
      phosphate, 2.5 meq per liter. The hyperproteinemia was attributed to dehydration,
      the lactic acidemia to shock, and the hyperphosphatemia to acidosis and transient
      renal failure. The mean concentrations of serum calcium and magnesium were
      slightly elevated but did not affect the increased anion gap. These results
      indicate that severe cholera causes acidosis with relatively little change in
      serum chloride but an increased serum anion gap. The acidosis is more profound
      than would be expected on the basis of stool losses of bicarbonate, because of
      superimposed lactic acidemia and renal failure.

TI  - Inheritance pattern and clinical response to splenectomy as a reflection of
      erythrocyte spectrin deficiency in hereditary spherocytosis.
PG  - 1579-83
AB  - To determine how various inheritance patterns and responses to splenectomy relate
      to erythrocyte spectrin deficiencies in hereditary spherocytosis, we measured the
      spectrin content of erythrocytes by radioimmunoassay in 33 patients with this
      disease. Patients with the dominant form of hereditary spherocytosis generally
      had mild anemia, with spectrin at 63 to 81 percent of normal levels. Patients
      with the nondominant form of the disease had anemia ranging from severe to mild, 
      with corresponding spectrin levels of 30 to 74 percent; their siblings were
      affected similarly. Distantly related homozygotes had different clinical
      severities with correspondingly different spectrin levels. The parents and
      offspring of patients with the nondominant form were clinically normal but
      consistently had subtle erythrocyte abnormalities. Spectrin levels in all
      patients were inversely related to osmotic fragility (P less than 0.0001), and
      they were also correlated with the clinical response to splenectomy: patients
      with spectrin levels above 70 percent achieved normal blood counts, those with
      levels of 40 to 70 percent had compensated hemolysis, and those with levels below
      40 percent improved but remained anemic (P less than 0.0001). We conclude that
      the inheritance pattern and response to splenectomy in hereditary spherocytosis
      reflect erythrocyte spectrin deficiencies as determined by radioimmunoassay.

TI  - Termination of early pregnancy by the progesterone antagonist RU 486
      (Mifepristone).
PG  - 1565-70
AB  - We studied the effects of the progesterone antagonist RU 486 in 100 women with
      early, unwanted pregnancy (within 10 days of the expected onset of the missed
      menstrual period). Thirty-four women received oral doses of 400 mg (in four
      days), 26 received 600 mg (in four days), and 40 received 800 mg (in two days).
      Uterine bleeding occurred in all patients within four days of the first dose and 
      continued for 5 to 17 days. In 85 of the women, a dramatic decrease in the plasma
      chorionic gonadotropin level was observed on day 6, and an empty uterus was
      confirmed by ultrasonography on day 13. Hence, these women were considered to
      have had a complete abortion. Fifteen subjects had persistently elevated plasma
      chorionic gonadotropin levels on day 6 and were considered not to have responded 
      to RU 486. They all had uterine evacuation, which was facilitated by a softening 
      of the cervix. The percentage of women with complete abortion was similar in all 
      dosage groups. Furthermore, plasma levels of immunoreactive RU 486 were similar
      in subjects with and without complete abortion. The only important side effect
      observed in the responders was prolonged uterine bleeding in 18 percent, but
      neither blood transfusion nor curettage was required. We conclude that RU 486 is 
      an effective and safe method for termination of very early pregnancy but that it 
      should be used only under close medical supervision.

TI  - A new way of enhancing the thermostability of proteases.
PG  - 695-7
AB  - Thermostability of enzyme can be enhanced by single amino acid substitutions.
      Recent advances in genetic engineering have made it possible to create novel
      proteins in a predictable manner where structural information for the protein is 
      available. This 'protein engineering' has already been used to enhance enzyme
      thermostability, but it is usually not clear which amino acid substitutions
      should be made. We consider that the following approach should be helpful in
      engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability: highly conserved residues
      should be left unchanged; the sequences of known mesophilic and thermophilic
      proteins should be used to suggest the kinds of changes likely to increase
      thermostability; and substitutions should be made that increase internal
      hydrophobicity and that stabilize helices for strong internal packing. We
      describe here the use of this approach to alter the thermostability of the
      thermostable neutral protease of Bacillus stearothermophilus, the sequence of
      which is known. Surprisingly we find that a single mutation that decreases
      thermostability can require two mutations that increase stability to compensate
      for it. The effects on stability are not additive, suggesting cooperativity.

TI  - Hemophilus influenzae type B disease in children vaccinated with type B
      polysaccharide vaccine.
PG  - 1584-90
AB  - We studied 55 cases of invasive Hemophilus influenzae type b disease occurring in
      children at least three weeks after vaccination with type b polysaccharide
      vaccine. Their mean age at the time of immunization was 27.8 months (range, 18 to
      47). Meningitis developed in 39 patients, of whom 3 died and 6 had neurologic
      sequelae. We investigated certain host factors that may have contributed to the
      failure of the vaccine. The geometric mean concentration of antibody to type b
      polysaccharide in convalescent-phase serum from 31 of the vaccinated patients who
      had hemophilus disease was significantly lower than that in serum from 25
      patients of similar age with the disease who had never been vaccinated (0.59 vs. 
      3.46 micrograms per milliliter, P less than 0.001). However, only 3 of 46
      patients in whom the vaccine failed and who were tested for hypogammaglobulinemia
      had this finding, and none of 33 children tested for IgG2 had low serum
      concentrations of this immunoglobulin subclass, which is thought to be important 
      in the immune response to polysaccharide antigens. In addition, all but 1 of the 
      46 patients in whom the vaccine failed and who were tested for IgG antibody to
      tetanus toxoid protein, a thymic-dependent antigen, had normal values, and 19 of 
      20 tested for hemolytic complement activity had normal levels. In white children,
      the presence of the Gm immunoglobulin phenotype (1,2,3, 17; ;5,13,21) was
      associated with a sevenfold increase in the relative risk of vaccine failure (P
      less than 0.003). We conclude that vaccine failure may be related in part to
      genetic factors, and that most vaccinated children in whom Hemophilus influenzae 
      disease develops have deficient antibody responses to the type b polysaccharide
      despite normal serum concentrations of immunoglobulin and normal antibody
      responses to tetanus toxoid.

TI  - The measurement of the production of tRNAMet1 in the Friend erythroleukemia cell.
PG  - 198-206
AB  - We have used the gene for tRNAMet1 as a hybridization probe to measure the
      production of tRNAMet1 in the Friend erythroleukemia cell. In this cell, the
      relative concentration of tRNAMet1 (i.e., the percentage of total steady-state
      tRNA representing tRNAMet1) is 1.60 +/- 0.18. To study the relative synthesis of 
      tRNAMet1, cells were labeled in vivo with [3H]uridine for periods ranging from 4 
      to 24 h, and the tRNA was isolated. The fraction of newly-synthesized tRNA
      representing tRNAMet1 (1.72% +/- 0.11) does not change when different in vivo
      labeling times are used. This value is similar to the relative concentration of
      tRNAMet1 in the older steady-state tRNA (1.61% +/- 0.18). The similar relative
      synthesis values using different labeling times, plus evidence presented that the
      total tRNA population decays homogeneously (t 1/2 = 110 h) indicate that tRNAMet1
      has a cytoplasmic stability similar to the general tRNA population, and that its 
      concentration relative to the tRNA population is established within the nucleus
      or soon after exiting the nucleus. Measurements of the synthesis of tRNAMet1 in
      isolated nuclei, relative to the synthesis of total RNA polymerase III
      transcripts, showed that this relative synthesis (0.291% +/- 0.017) is only 17%
      of the relative concentration of tRNAMet1 in the cytoplasm, which may reflect the
      presence of sequences other than tRNA in total nuclear polymerase III
      transcripts.

TI  - Polymorphism of human Ia antigens generated by reciprocal intergenic exchange
      between two DR beta loci.
PG  - 676-9
AB  - Class II molecules encoded by the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
      are involved in regulating T-cell response to antigens. The mechanisms for
      generating polymorphism in products of the MHC have been studied extensively for 
      both the murine H-2 and the human HLA complex. Such studies indicate that point
      mutations plus selection have a major role in the generation of polymorphisms of 
      class I and class II MHC genes. However, a non-reciprocal gene conversion
      mechanism has been proposed to explain several examples of clustered sequence
      variation in MHC genes. In all these examples, the proposed gene conversion event
      is unidirectional; that is, one of the two interacting genes acts as sequence
      donor and the other as sequence recipient. No examples of potential reciprocal
      genetic exchange (as occurs in the fungal system), in which the two interacting
      genes act as both donor and recipient of gene fragments, have been found in the
      MHC system or in other multigene families of higher organisms. We sequenced two
      different HLA-DR beta complementary DNAs from each of two different cells all
      expressing the same serologically defined determinant (DR2) but different
      T-cell-recognized (Dw) specificities (Dw12 and MN2). Sequence comparisons of
      these four cDNA clones (and two DR beta amino-acid sequences from the DR2-Dw2
      subtype) suggest that new coding sequences for DR beta molecules in the DR2
      haplotypes are potentially generated by reciprocal intergenic exchange.

PG  - 238-42
AB  - DNA methyltransferase was isolated as a single polypeptide of 190 kDa from mouse 
      P815 mastocytoma cells by immunoaffinity chromatography. This polypeptide seems
      to be highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation resulting in additional
      polypeptides in the size range of 150 to 190 kDa. A polypeptide of 190 kDa was
      immunoprecipitated by monoclonal anti-DNA methyltransferase antibodies from
      extracts of two different human cell lines, Raji and K562. The 190 kDa
      polypeptide was synthesized in rapidly proliferating cells and, albeit at a much 
      lower rate, also in cells grown to saturating density. DNA methyltransferase
      polypeptides smaller than 190 kDa were synthesized neither in log phase nor in
      stationary phase cells.

TI  - Treatment of chronic non-A,non-B hepatitis with recombinant human alpha
      interferon. A preliminary report.
PG  - 1575-8
AB  - We treated 10 patients who had chronic non-A,non-B hepatitis with recombinant
      human alpha interferon in varying doses (0.5 to 5 million units) daily, every
      other day, or three times weekly for up to 12 months. In 8 of the 10 patients,
      elevated serum aminotransferase levels decreased rapidly during therapy and
      eventually fell into the normal or nearly normal range. In two of these patients,
      the interferon therapy was stopped after four months, and in both cases, a prompt
      return of aminotransferase activities to pretreatment values occurred. Prolonged 
      treatment was associated with a sustained improvement in aminotransferase levels;
      in three cases, biopsy specimens obtained after one year of therapy showed marked
      improvement in hepatic histology, even though low doses of alpha interferon had
      been used. These preliminary findings, although not adequately controlled,
      suggest that long-term, low-dose alpha interferon therapy may be effective in
      controlling the disease activity in some patients with chronic non-A,non-B
      hepatitis. A prospective controlled trial is now needed to assess the role of
      interferon therapy in this disease.

TI  - Exogenous reinfection with tuberculosis in a shelter for the homeless.
PG  - 1570-5
AB  - We investigated an outbreak of tuberculosis in a large shelter for the homeless
      to assess the role of exogenous reinfection as opposed to reactivation of
      endogenous infection as the cause of secondary tuberculosis in this population.
      Exogenous reinfection is considered relatively unimportant in the United States
      and other developed countries. Of 49 shelter-related cases, 22 had cultures
      resistant to both isoniazid and streptomycin and of the same phage type,
      indicating recent transmission originating with a single index patient. The
      probable index patient had a 10-year history of isoniazid and streptomycin
      resistance--an uncommon pattern at the shelter during the three years preceding
      the outbreak. In 4 of the 22 cases, the patient had previously had documented
      tuberculosis infection or disease. These reinfected patients had extensive lung
      cavitation and numerous acid-fast bacilli on sputum smears--features associated
      with contagiousness. In contrast, patients with tuberculosis for the first time
      (primary tuberculosis) are usually less contagious. We conclude that exogenous
      reinfection may have been an important factor leading to highly contagious
      secondary cases and an acceleration of the usual pattern of tuberculosis
      transmission in this highly susceptible population.

TI  - Molecular cloning and polymorphism of the human immune deficiency virus type 2.
PG  - 691-5
AB  - We recently reported the isolation of a novel retrovirus, the human immune
      deficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2, previously named LAV-2), from patients with
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) originating from West Africa. This
      virus is related to HIV-1, the causative agent of the AIDS epidemic now spreading
      in Central and East Africa, as well as the USA and Europe (see ref. 3 for review)
      both by its morphology and by its tropism and in vitro cytopathic effect on CD4
      (T4) positive cell lines and lymphocytes. But preliminary hybridization
      experiments indicated that there are substantiated differences between the
      sequences of the two genomes. Furthermore, the proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have
      different sizes and their serological cross-reactivity is restricted to the major
      core protein, as the envelope glycoproteins of HIV-2 are not immunoprecipitated
      by HIV-1-positive sera. We now report the molecular cloning of the complete
      9.5-kilobase (kb) genome of HIV-2, the observation of restriction site
      polymorphism between different isolates, and a preliminary analysis of the
      relationship of HIV-2 with other human and simian retroviruses.

TI  - Steroid-free glucocorticoid receptor binds specifically to mouse mammary tumour
      virus DNA.
PG  - 688-91
AB  - Steroid hormones are thought to modulate gene expression through their
      interaction with receptor proteins. The intracellular localization of unoccupied 
      receptor proteins has been a subject of controversy: free glucocorticoid receptor
      appears to reside in the cytoplasm and moves to the cell nucleus only after
      binding the steroid. The purified hormone-bound glucocorticoid receptor has been 
      shown to bind selectively to hormone regulatory elements (HRE) in the vicinity of
      hormonally-inducible promoters and, in particular, in the long terminal repeat
      (LTR) region of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). We have tackled the question
      of whether the hormone itself is required for the interaction of the receptor
      protein with the HRE. Using monoclonal antibodies to the receptor we find that
      upon heat-activation the steroid-free glucocorticoid receptor present in rat
      liver cytosol binds specifically in vitro to the HRE of MMTV. No qualitative
      differences in the DNaseI-footprints were detected when hormone-free receptor was
      compared to the hormone-receptor complex or even receptor complexed with the
      hormone antagonist RU486. We conclude that the steroid ligand is not an absolute 
      requirement for generating the conformation of the glucocorticoid receptor that
      allows its interaction with the HRE in vitro. An alternative function of the
      hormone in vivo could be to modulate nuclear partitioning of the receptor.

TI  - High frequency of unequal recombination in pseudoautosomal region shown by
      proviral insertion in transgenic mouse.
PG  - 682-5
AB  - The mammalian X and Y chromosomes, in contrast to the autosomes, pair during male
      meiosis only near the telomeres. Alleles localized in this region can undergo
      reciprocal exchange during meiosis. Because such sequences do not show strict
      sex-linked inheritance, they have been termed pseudoautosomal. In man, several
      DNA sequences have been described which show pseudoautosomal transmission and
      which are localized in the pairing region at the ends of the short arms of both
      the X and Y chromosomes (refs 6-9, and D. Page, unpublished results). We now show
      that the transgenic mouse strain, Mov-15, contains a single Moloney murine
      leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) genome in its germline, and genetic evidence indicates
      that the provirus is integrated into the pseudoautosomal region of the sex
      chromosome. Proviral copies are lost or gained in 7% of male meioses in this
      strain, and mouse sequences flanking the provirus are tandemly repeated and
      highly variable. We conclude that unequal recombination events occur with high
      frequency in the pairing region, possibly because of the presence of repeated
      sequences.

TI  - Predominant use of a V alpha gene segment in mouse T-cell receptors for
      cytochrome c.
PG  - 679-82
AB  - The T-cell receptor is a cell surface heterodimer consisting of an alpha and a
      beta chain that binds foreign antigen in the context of a cell surface molecule
      encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), thus restricting the
      T-cell response to the surface of antigen presenting cells. The variable (V)
      domain of the receptor binds antigen and MHC molecules and is composed of
      distinct regions encoded by separate gene elements--variable (V alpha and V
      beta), diversity (D beta) and joining (J alpha and J beta)--rearranged and joined
      during T-cell differentiation to generate contiguous V alpha and V beta genes.
      T-helper cells, which facilitate T and B cell responses, bind antigen in the
      context of a class II MHC molecule. The helper T-cell response to cytochrome c in
      mice is a well-defined model for studying the T-cell response to restricted
      antigen and MHC determinants. Only mice expressing certain class II molecules can
      respond to this antigen (Ek alpha Ek beta, Ek alpha Eb beta, Ev alpha Ev beta and
      Ek alpha Es beta). Most T cells appear to recognize the C-terminal peptide of
      cytochrome c (residues 81-104 in pigeon cytochrome c). We have raised helper T
      cells to pigeon cytochrome c or its C-terminal peptide analogues in four
      different MHC congenic strains of mice encoding each of the four responding class
      II molecules. We have isolated and sequenced seven V alpha genes and six V beta
      genes and analysed seven additional helper T cells by Northern blot to compare
      the structure of the V alpha and V beta gene segments with their antigen and MHC 
      specificities. We have added five examples taken from the literature. These data 
      show that a single V alpha gene segment is responsible for a large part of the
      response of mice to cytochrome c but there is no simple correlation of MHC
      restriction with gene segment use.

TI  - In vivo protein-DNA interactions in a glucocorticoid response element require the
      presence of the hormone.
PG  - 686-8
AB  - Transcriptional activation of gene expression by glucocorticoid hormones is
      mediated by the interaction of hormone-receptor complexes with specific DNA
      sequences called glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs) (refs 1-3, see ref. 4 
      for review). Deletion of this sequence abolishes glucocorticoid induction of
      transcription. According to a current model, activation of the cytoplasmic
      receptor protein by hormone binding leads to its increased affinity for and
      translocation to the nucleus. However, recent reports that the oestradiol and
      progesterone receptors are localized in the nucleus in the absence of steroid led
      us to examine whether the free receptor interacts in vivo with its DNA binding
      site in the absence of hormone binding. We used the genomic footprinting
      technique to show that changes in in vivo protein-DNA interactions within the
      GREs of the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (TAT) can be detected only after
      hormone treatment in hepatoma cells. Such changes are not detected in fibroblast 
      cells, in which the TAT gene is not expressed. Many of the changes in
      dimethylsulphate reactivity observed in the living cell are also found in vitro
      using cloned DNA and a partially purified glucocorticoid receptor.

TI  - Differential and stage-related expression in embryonic tissues of a new human
      homoeobox gene.
PG  - 664-8
AB  - The homoeobox is a 183 base-pair (bp) DNA sequence conserved in several
      Drosophila genes controlling segmentation and segment identity. Homoeobox
      sequences have been detected in the genome of species ranging from insects and
      anellids to vertebrates and homoeobox containing genes have been cloned from
      Xenopus, mouse and man. We recently isolated human homoeobox containing
      complementary DNA clones, that represent transcripts from four different human
      genes. One clone (HHO.c10) is selectively expressed in a 2.1 kilobase (kb)
      polyadenylated transcript in the spinal cord of human embryos and fetuses 5-10
      weeks after fertilization. We report the characterization of a second cDNA clone,
      termed HHO.c13, that represents a new homoeobox gene. This clone encodes a
      protein of 255 amino-acid residues, which includes a pentapeptide, upstream of
      the homoeo domain, conserved in other Drosophila, Xenopus, murine and human
      homoeobox genes. By Northern analysis HHO.c13 detects multiple embryonic
      transcripts, which are differentially expressed in spinal cord, brain, backbone
      rudiments, limb buds and heart in 5-9-week-old human embryos and fetuses, in a
      striking organ- and stage-specific pattern. These observations suggest that in
      early mammalian development homoeobox genes may exert a wide spectrum of control 
      functions in a variety of organs and body parts, in addition to the spinal cord.

TI  - Homoeobox gene expression in mouse embryos varies with position by the primitive 
      streak stage.
PG  - 662-4
AB  - Pattern formation in animal development requires that genes be expressed
      differentially according to position in the sheets of cells that make up the
      early embryo. The homoeobox-containing genes of Drosophila are control genes
      active both in the establishment of a segmentation pattern and in the
      specification of segment identity. In situ hybridization experiments confirm that
      these genes are expressed in a segmentally-restricted manner and that their
      expression presages morphological differentiation of segmental structures.
      Homoeobox genes have recently been isolated from the mouse and have been shown to
      be expressed during mouse development. Using in situ hybridization, we show here 
      that expression of the mouse homoeobox gene Mo-10 (ref. 7) is spatially
      restricted in the developing embryo and that localization of expression is
      already evident within the germ layers before their morphological
      differentiation. These findings support the suggestion that the homoeobox genes
      of mammals, like those of Drosophila, may be important in pattern formation.

      animal models. Mice that are homozygous for either the lpr (lymphoproliferation) 
      or gld (generalized lymphoproliferative disease) mutant genes develop a disease
      characterized by massive lymphadenopathy and autoantibody formation. With age,
      the lymphoid organs in these mice are replaced with a greatly expanded population
      of abnormal lymphocytes. Recent work has shown that these cells are likely to be 
      in the T-cell lineage. They rearrange and transcribe the genes for the alpha and 
      beta subunits of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and a third, T-cell receptor-like
      gene, T gamma. As determined by immunofluorescence with anti-receptor antibodies 
      the cells also express TCR on the cell surface. The murine T-cell receptor
      consists of the alpha and beta chains, derived from the rearranged alpha and beta
      genes, in non-covalent association with seven other chains; the delta chain, of
      relative molecular mass (Mr) 26,000 (26K), the epsilon chain (25K), a
      glycosylated 21K chain (gp21) which is probably the homologue of the gamma chain 
      of T3 (CD3), a 16K homodimer (zeta) and a 21K dimer (p21). This multichain
      complex is thought to be the murine analogue of the human T3 complex. After
      activation of normal T cells by antigen or lectin, p21 is phosphorylated on
      tyrosine residues and gp21 is phosphorylated on serine residues. In contrast, in 
      the gld and lpr cells, p21 is phosphorylated even in the absence of antigen or
      lectin, whereas gp21 is not phosphorylated.

TI  - Location of a delta-subunit region determining ion transport through the
      acetylcholine receptor channel.
PG  - 670-4
AB  - The combination of complementary DNA expression and single-channel current
      analysis provides a powerful tool for studying the structure-function
      relationship of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) (refs 1-5). We have
      previously shown that AChR channels consisting of subunits from different
      species, expressed in the surface membrane of Xenopus oocytes, can be used to
      relate functional properties to individual subunits. Here we report that, in
      extracellular solution of low divalent cation concentration, the bovine AChR
      channel has a smaller conductance than the Torpedo AChR channel. Replacement of
      the delta-subunit of the Torpedo AChR by the bovine delta-subunit makes the
      channel conductance similar to that of the bovine AChR channel. To locate the
      region in the delta-subunit responsible for this difference, we have constructed 
      chimaeric delta-subunit cDNAs with different combinations of the Torpedo and
      bovine counterparts. The conductances of AChR channels containing chimaeric
      delta-subunits suggest that a region comprising the putative transmembrane
      segment M2 and the adjacent bend portion between segments M2 and M3 is involved
      in determining the rate of ion transport through the open channel.

TI  - Cytoskeleton involvement in the distribution of mRNP complexes and small
      cytoplasmic RNAs.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - These studies were designed to determine whether small cytoplasmic RNAs and two
      different mRNAs (actin mRNA and histone H4 mRNA) were uniformly distributed among
      various subcellular compartments. The cytoplasm of HeLa S3 cells was fractionated
      into four RNA-containing compartments. The RNAs bound to the cytoskeleton were
      separated from those in the soluble cytoplasmic phase and each RNA fraction was
      further separated into those bound and those not bound to polyribosomes. The four
      cytoplasmic RNA fractions were analysed to determine which RNA species were
      present in each. The 7 S RNAs were found in all cytoplasmic fractions, as were
      the 5 S and 5.8 S ribosomal RNAs, while transfer RNA was found largely in the
      soluble fraction devoid of polysomes. On the other hand a group of prominent
      small cytoplasmic RNAs (scRNAs of 105-348 nucleotides) was isolated from the
      fraction devoid of polysomes but bound to the cytoskeleton. Actin mRNA was found 
      only in polyribosomes bound to the cytoskeleton. This mRNA was released into the 
      soluble phase by cytochalasin B treatment, suggesting a dependence upon actin
      filament integrity for cytoskeletal binding. A significant portion of several
      scRNAs was also released from the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin B treatment.
      Analysis of the spatial distribution of histone H4 mRNAs, however, revealed a
      more widely dispersed message. Although most (60%) of the H4 mRNA was associated 
      with polyribosomes in the soluble phase, a significant amount was also recovered 
      in both of the cytoskeleton bound fractions either associated or free of
      polyribosome interaction. Treatment with cytochalasin B suggested that only
      cytoskeleton bound, untranslated H4 mRNA was dependent upon the integrity of
      actin filaments for cytoskeletal binding.

TI  - Tumour inhibition by interleukin-2 at the tumour/host interface.
PG  - 307-27
AB  - Until recently, lymphokines were regarded suspiciously as 'ill-defined factors'. 
      Today, however, some of them have been clearly defined in both structural and
      functional terms. The interleukin-2 (IL-2) molecule and its specific membrane
      receptors have been the subject of particular attention. Endogenous IL-2 has
      proved to be an important signal for the activation and expansion of various
      cell-mediated immunity functions, while exogenous IL-2 has been used to activate 
      numerous cell functions, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as in tumour
      immunotherapy, both alone or combined with lymphocytes previously activated in
      vitro (lymphokine-activated killer cells). Adoptive transfer of these cells
      together with high doses of IL-2 is particularly promising from the clinical
      standpoint, though by no means free from problems. IL-2 can also be employed in
      small doses locally in the presence of non-activated lymphocytes from tumour
      bearing mice to induce a local reaction that subsequently becomes systemic and
      can lead to the rejection of incipient tumours. Various host immune cells,
      primarily eosinophils and lymphocytes are involved in this reaction, which can
      also give rise to tumour-specific immune memory. In this way, the host immune
      system, despite its inevitable defeat in the first battle against a tumour, may
      acquire an important role in the long war that lies ahead.

TI  - T-cell responses at the host: tumour interface.
PG  - 289-305
AB  - The evidence considered here reinforces the conclusion that T-cell responses to
      tumours involve complex cellular interactions. An attempt to summarize some of
      these interactions is shown. This emphasizes that not only are the interactions
      between the effector cell populations complicated, but that the target cell
      surface is also subject to variation and modification as a result of the immune
      response. A feature that also emerges from these studies is that most cells
      apparently responding to or infiltrating a tumour do not necessarily participate 
      in its destruction, and it is in this area that experimental tumour systems have 
      particular value. This also perhaps explains the preoccupation of
      experimentalists with the identification of 'the' effector cell crucial to tumour
      rejection. However, there is heterogeneity between systems in terms of the type
      of rejection response induced, but a logical basis for this heterogeneity is not 
      established. If experimental studies could define the nature of the immune
      response generated by a tumour in the context of the biological features of the
      tumour itself, this could lead to the prediction of the immunogenicity and
      potential for induction of a rejection response for that tumor. Clearly,
      experimental tumour systems do not provide an exact reflection of the situation
      with human tumours. However, they may provide systems that illuminate particular 
      aspects of the human response, and give precedents to guide the interpretation of
      data derived from human systems. This form of assessment is still at an early
      stage, but developments in the experimental field should provide a framework for 
      the development and exploitation of T-cell responses to tumours.

TI  - Human lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK cells) as a potential
      immunotherapeutic modality.
PG  - 267-79
AB  - Lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) are cytolytic lymphocytes with the unique
      capacity of killing NK-resistant fresh human tumor cells in short-term assays.
      LAK appear to kill autologous tumors as well as TNP-modified self and allogeneic 
      tumors with complete crossreactivity, both at the population and clonal level.
      Initial studies on the classification of LAK conclude that LAK are distinct from 
      the classical NK and T-lymphocyte systems based on a number of criteria including
      surface phenotype, activation conditions, and spectrum of susceptible target
      cells. LAK kill rasoncogene-transfected fibroblasts in a manner similar to fresh 
      tumors. As yet, the target cell determinant responsible for susceptibility to LAK
      lysis is unknown, but cell-surface proteins are definitely involved. Activation
      of LAK requires only IL-2, and is most efficient using serum-free conditions.
      Because interleukin-2 alone is sufficient for LAK activation, we have tested in
      vitro whether fresh PBL could be activated in the presence of tumor, as might be 
      desired in vivo. LAK activation was greatly suppressed by tumor presence. LAK
      activation is also suppressed by hydrocortisone, but not cyclosporine A. Because 
      of the above and other findings, we have initiated a clinical protocol to test
      whether LAK made from brain-tumor patients' PBL could eliminate residual glioma
      tumor cells. Autochthonous LAK, plus rIL-2 to maintain lytic ability, are
      injected during surgery. Preclinical studies in a rat glioma model have shown
      this approach to be safe. Eleven glioma patients have been injected
      intracerebrally with IL-2 and/or LAK with no immediate or long-term (14 months
      follow-up) adverse effects. Much work is needed to understand the LAK phenomenon 
      and to resolve its potential usefulness in cancer therapy as well as its inherent
      biologic role.

TI  - Membrane structures involved in auto-tumor recognition.
PG  - 253-65
AB  - Tumor patients' blood lymphocytes have the capacity to recognize autologous tumor
      cells in vitro. A consequence of this recognition is the proliferation of
      small-size, high-density, resting T cells. Both helper (CD4+) and
      cytotoxic/suppressor (CD8+) T lymphocytes proliferate in the mixed
      lymphocyte-tumor cell cultures. In contrast to the autologous mixed lymphocyte
      cultures, both the auto-erythrocyte rosetting and non-rosetting (AE+ and AE-) T
      cells participate in the auto-tumor response. In contrast to stimulation by
      virus-infected or hapten-modified cells, DR antigen expression is not essential
      for stimulation by autologous tumor cells. In a proportion of cancer patients,
      blood lymphocytes have the capacity to lyse the patients' own tumor cells in
      vitro. There are two populations of lymphocytes with auto-tumor cytotoxic
      function. The first is characterized by low buoyant density and by non-adaptive
      cytotoxicity. In contrast to the recognition of hapten-modified or virus-infected
      target cells by the CTL, recognition of autologous tumor cells by the cytotoxic
      LD cells occurs even when the MHC class I antigens are blocked by mAb. The CD3
      complex is also not involved in LD-mediated lysis. The other population with
      auto-tumor cytotoxic function comprises high-density, resting T cells.
      Recognition of autologous tumor cells by cytotoxic HD lymphocytes shares the
      characteristics of CTLs, i.e., their function is abrogated by pretreatment of the
      effectors with mAbs directed to the T3 receptor complex and by preincubation of
      the targets with mAb to the MHC class I antigens. Cytotoxicity of HD cells is
      restricted to the autologous tumor cells. This selectivity and the
      characteristics shared with CTL suggest that the auto-tumor reactivity of HD
      lymphocytes reflects an immune response against the autologous tumor.

TI  - Possible involvement of histamine H2-receptors in the vasodilator effect of
      clonidine on isolated and perfused canine coronary arteries.
PG  - 327-31
AB  - The mechanism of clonidine-induced vasodilatation was investigated in the
      isolated and perfused canine coronary arteries. Clonidine produced a slight
      vasoconstriction at small doses whereas it induced a dose-related vasodilatation 
      at large doses (more than 3 micrograms). The vasodilatation was reversed to
      vasoconstriction by treatment with 100 micrograms of cimetidine (a selective
      H2-receptor antagonist) but was not affected by 100 micrograms of
      chlorpheniramine (a selective H1-receptor antagonist). These results suggest that
      clonidine can dilate the isolated and perfused canine coronary arteries by acting
      on histamine H2-receptors.

TI  - Kainic acid stimulates GABA release from a subpopulation of cerebellar
      astrocytes.
PG  - 319-22
AB  - The effect of acute exposure to micromolar concentrations of kainic acid was
      studied in rat cerebellar astroglial cultures consisting of two antigenically and
      functionally distinct subpopulations of astrocytes. Kainate (20-100 microM)
      released [3H]GABA preaccumulated by A2B5-positive stellate astrocytes in a
      concentration-, Na+- and Ca2+-dependent way, and did not interfere with [3H]GABA 
      transport. We hypothesize that kainate depolarizes this class of cells by
      activating cationic channels and that this results in an imbalance of GABAergic
      transmission.

TI  - Ketanserin and pirenperone attenuate acute morphine withdrawal in rats.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - The involvement of serotonin2 (5-HT2) receptors in the expression of opiate
      withdrawal was examined using a behavioral test for acute morphine dependence.
      The 5-HT2 antagonists, ketanserin and pirenperone, injected shortly before
      naloxone, attenuated the naloxone-induced suppression of an autoshaped
      lever-touch response in rats treated 4 h earlier with a moderate dose of
      morphine. A low dose of pirenperone was also effective in blocking
      withdrawal-induced hypothermia. These data support the hypothesis that 5-HT is
      involved in the expression of opiate withdrawal.

TI  - Full and partial relaxing CCK-C-terminal fragments in hog duodenal circular
      muscle.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - The essential active moieties in the cholecystokinin (CCK) ligand for relaxing
      duodenal circular muscles of pigs were investigated. The decrease in isotonic
      tension from the normal tone was expressed as a percentage of the relaxation
      obtained with Ca2+-free EGTA (2 mM) solution. Inhibition was expressed as a
      percentage of the relaxation induced by CCK-C-terminal tetrapeptide (CCK-4, 4.23 
      microM) without antagonists. Amino acid sequences from CCK-(27-28) to CCK-(27-31)
      increased the potency. CCK-(27-30) or CCK-(27-31) attained the same extent of
      relative intrinsic activity as CCK-8. The amino acid sequence from Tyr27,
      CCK-(27), to Trp30, CCK-(30), is another prerequisite for relaxation, in addition
      to the sequence of CCK-4. Newly synthesized CCK-(27-30)-R derivatives with
      increasingly bulky substituents (R = H, ethyl, phenyl, n-butyl and allyl) were
      changed from full agonists to partial agonists. Phenyl, n-butyl and allyl
      derivatives of CCK-(27-30)-R, in particular, had a mixed agonist and antagonist
      action. CCK-(27-30)-allyl antagonized competitively the CCK-4-induced relaxation 
      (IC50 = 123 (75.9-200) microM).

PG  - 229-36
AB  - Focal injection of gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulphonic acid (GAMS) into basal
      ganglia areas, the substantia nigra and entopeduncular nucleus, protects against 
      electroshock (50 mA, 60 Hz, 0.2 s) and pilocarpine (380 mg/kg i.p.) induced
      seizures in rats. GAMS infusion into substantia nigra pars reticulata
      significantly protects against generalised (5, 10 nmol) and limbic (10, 50 nmol) 
      seizures. The highest dose of GAMS results in similar suppression of seizure
      activity following injection into substantia nigra pars compacta against
      generalised (10 nmol) and limbic (50 nmol) seizures. The anticonvulsant action of
      GAMS is less marked after infusion into the entopeduncular nucleus. High doses of
      GAMS are required to provide protection against electroshock test (10 nmol) and
      limbic (40 nmol) seizures. Protection against limbic and electroshock seizures is
      more pronounced after infusion of GAMS into substantia nigra than into the
      entopeduncular nucleus. The substantia nigra pars reticulata is particularly
      sensitive to the anticonvulsant action of GAMS suggesting that antagonism at the 
      kainate receptor is functionally important.

TI  - Rapid and brief tolerance to (+)- and (-)-nicotine in unanesthetized rats.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - When given intravenously to unanesthetized rats as a bolus dose, (-)-nicotine
      produced a dose-related rise in blood pressure and fall in heart rate in the dose
      range of 5-40 micrograms/kg. Tolerance did not develop when doses were given at
      30 min intervals. At the highest dose, the effects on heart rate persisted. In
      addition, severe arrhythmias and apnea were observed. (+)-Nicotine at 100
      micrograms/kg produced effects similar to 10 micrograms/kg of (-)-nicotine. When 
      given at 1 min intervals, tolerance quickly developed after only 6 injections at 
      5 micrograms/kg and after 4 injections at 10 micrograms/kg. Tolerance to
      (+)-nicotine also developed rapidly and was no longer evident at 5 min. The
      results suggest the tolerance is related to frequency of administration and dose.
      The implication of these results are discussed with regard to cardiovascular
      disease and dependence. In addition, we postulate that the relatively low degree 
      of biological stereoselectivity of the optical isomers of nicotine, compared with
      that of the enantiomers of morphine, is due to the simplicity and flexibility of 
      the nicotine molecule. It can be shown using Dreiding models that the nitrogen
      atoms in the enantiomers are nearly superimposable.

TI  - Satiety and scratching; effects of bombesin-like peptides.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - Two novel amphibian peptides, [Ser7]litorin-like peptide (Ser-LIT) and
      [Ser7]bombesin-like peptide (Ser-BN), recently isolated from the skin of the
      South American frog Phyllomedusa sauvagei, are characterized by the occurrence of
      a Ser residue in place of His7 in the C-terminal tripeptide. For testing on food 
      intake in fasted rats the peptides were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) and
      intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) and their activity compared with that of
      bombesin (BN) and litorin (LIT). Ser-LIT was completely ineffective on food
      intake while Ser-BN was about ten times less potent than LIT by i.p. injection;
      given i.c.v., Ser-BN inhibited food intake in the first 15 min after injection
      but its effect faded within 60 min. The i.c.v. administration of both
      [Ser7]-substituted peptides, elicited intense scratching with a potency equal to 
      or higher than that of BN or LIT. The existence of two different kinds of
      receptors for BN-like peptides may be hypothesized: the first, specific for the
      C-terminal tripeptide sequence, is apparently involved in the inhibition of
      feeding; the second, responsible for the stimulating activity on the urinary
      bladder and for scratching, shows higher affinity for the N-terminal portion of
      the biological active sequence.

TI  - Comparison of the muscarinic cholinoceptors in the rabbit ciliary body and the

PG  - 171-8
AB  - Interactions of several muscarinic drugs with their receptors were studied in the
      ciliary body smooth muscle of rabbits and the ileal longitudinal muscle of
      guinea-pigs, using pharmacological and biochemical procedures. The dissociation
      constants of carbachol, pilocarpine, atropine and pirenzepine estimated by these 
      procedures indicate no heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors in either tissue;
      thus both are probably of the M2 type. However, the density of the receptors in
      the ciliary body is lower than in the ileum. Pilocarpine, with lower intrinsic
      efficacy, demonstrated a pronounced organ selectivity when compared to carbachol 
      as it was a potent full agonist in the ileum and a competitive antagonist in the 
      ciliary body. These results suggest the importance of both receptor density and
      threshold as determinants of agonist potency.

AB  - The pharmacological effects of peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), glucagon and
      secretin were compared with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on rabbit
      urethra and anococcygeus muscle. VIP and PHI dose-dependently inhibited induced
      contractions of both smooth muscle preparations. Cross-tachyphylaxis between VIP 
      and PHI was demonstrated in the urethra preparation, suggesting that their
      activity is mediated via a common receptor or second messenger. Glucagon and
      secretin were without effect on either preparation. Radioimmunoassays
      demonstrated substantial concentrations of VIP and PHI in both urethra and
      anococcygeus tissue extracts. These observations suggest that PHI is an
      additional candidate together with VIP to mediate relaxation of rabbit urethra
      and anococcygeus muscle. When compared with VIP, Gila monster venom was found to 
      inhibit both smooth muscle preparations, producing concentration-response curves 
      parallel to those produced by VIP.

AB  - The effect of the irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

      receptors was assessed using the muscarinic antagonists [3H]N-methylscopolamine
      [( 3H]NMS) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB). No alteration in the
      maximal binding capacity (Bmax) or equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was
      observed in brain homogenates obtained from mice 12 h after a single injection of
      DFP when [3H]NMS was employed as the ligand. However, one administration of DFP
      produced a 24 and 33% decrease in Bmax as measured by [3H]NMS binding after 18
      and 24 h, respectively. A similar decrease in Bmax was found after two (31%) and 
      three (29%) days of daily DFP treatment. On the other hand, Scatchard analysis
      using [3H]QNB binding in the brain revealed no difference in KD or Bmax between
      untreated and 24 h DFP-treated mice. Thus, there is a differential alteration in 
      mouse brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors using these two ligands which
      suggests that [3H]NMS binding sites are more sensitive to regulation following
      acute organophosphate administration.

AB  - Using radioligand binding techniques and human frontal cortex, we determined the

      S1 (probably the S1A subtype) and serotonin S2 receptors using [3H]WB4101 and
      [3H]ketanserin, respectively. At the serotonin S1 receptor, the most and least

      microM), respectively. At the serotonin S2 receptor, the most and least potent
      antidepressants were amoxapine (KD = 0.6 nM) and bupropion (KD = 90 microM),
      respectively. Analysis of the data revealed a relationship between structure and 
      serotonin S1 affinity for some tricyclic antidepressants. Buspirone, a new
      anxiolytic agent, possessed high affinity for the serotonin S1 receptor (KD = 3.8
      nM).

TI  - Study of the time-resolved tryptophan fluorescence of crystalline
      alpha-chymotrypsin.
PG  - 8301-8
AB  - The tryptophan environments in crystalline alpha-chymotrypsin were investigated
      by fluorescence. The heterogeneous emission from this multitryptophan enzyme was 
      resolved by time-correlated fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence decays at
      296-nm laser excitation and various emission wavelengths could be characterized
      by a triple-exponential function with decay times tau 1 = 150 +/- 50 ps, tau 2 = 
      1.45 +/- 0.25 ns, and tau 3 = 4.2 +/- 0.4 ns. The corresponding decay-associated 
      emission spectra of the three components had maxima at about 325, 332, and 343
      nm. The three decay components in this enzyme can be correlated with X-ray
      crystallographic data [Birktoft, J.J., & Blow, D.M. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 68,
      187-240]. Inter- and intramolecular tryptophan-tryptophan energy-transfer
      efficiencies in crystalline alpha-chymotrypsin were computed from the accurately 
      known positions and orientations of all tryptophan residues. These calculations
      indicate that the three fluorescence decay components in crystalline
      alpha-chymotrypsin can be assigned to three distinct classes of tryptophyl
      residues. Because of the different proximity of tryptophan residues to
      neighboring internal quenching groups, the decay times of the three classes are
      different. Decay tau 1 can be assigned to Trp-172 and Trp-215 and tau 2 to Trp-51
      and Trp-237, while the tryptophyl residues 27, 29, 141, and 207 all have decay
      time tau 3.

TI  - GDP state of tubulin: stabilization of double rings.
PG  - 8292-300
AB  - Purified tubulin, with GDP occupying the exchangeable nucleotide binding site,
      has been examined conformationally and for its ability to self-associate into
      double rings. The circular dichroism spectrum increased by ca. 10% in negative
      amplitude between 205 and 225 nm over the spectrum of tubulin in the GTP state,
      but there were no significant shape changes. This indicates that replacement of
      GTP by GDP induces tubulin to adopt a more ordered conformation. The
      sedimentation coefficients of tubulin alpha-beta dimers in the GDP and GTP states
      were identical, with s20,w = 5.8 S. A sedimentation velocity study of tubulin in 
      the GDP state showed that, in the presence of magnesium ions, this protein
      undergoes a reversible Gilbert-type self-association. The end product of this
      reaction was found to be 26 subunit double rings identical with those described
      by Frigon and Timasheff [(1975) Biochemistry 14, 4567-4599] for a similar
      polymerization of tubulin in the GTP state. Analysis of the data showed that
      Tu-GDP has a much stronger propensity for the formation of double rings than
      Tu-GTP, the corresponding equilibrium with constants for the 26Tu in equilibrium 
      Tu26 being 4.2 X 10(119) M-25 and 2.27 X 10(109) M-25 for Tu-GDP and Tu-GTP,
      respectively. This leads to Tu-GTP being predominantly in the form of alpha-beta 
      dimers and Tu-GDP in the form of double rings under normal experimental
      conditions used in the study of microtubule assembly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Enthalpy changes in microtubule assembly from pure tubulin.
PG  - 8285-91
AB  - The enthalpy changes that occur in the self-assembly of tubulin into microtubules
      were examined by adiabatic differential heat capacity microcalorimetry and by
      isothermal batch microcalorimetry. Tubulin solutions at concentrations between 7 
      and 17 mg/mL were heated from 0 to 40 degrees C at heating rates of 1 or 2
      deg/min in pH 6.8 or 7.0 assembly buffers containing 20 mM MES, 100 mM glutamic
      acid, 5 mM MgCl2, 3.4 M glycerol, and either 0.5 mM GMP-PCP or 1 mM GTP. The
      assembly reaction in the presence of GTP was characterized by a complex
      heat-uptake pattern consisting of a broad endotherm with a sharper exotherm
      superimposed on it, similar to assembly in a GTP phosphate buffer [Hinz, H.-J.,
      Gorbunoff, M.J., Price, B., & Timasheff, S.N. (1979) Biochemistry 18,3084].
      Replacement of GTP by the nonhydrolyzable analogue resulted in a pattern typical 
      for an endothermic reaction only. These results have permitted the assignment of 
      the endothermic process to microtubule assembly and of the exothermic process to 
      the resultant GTP hydrolysis. In these studies equilibration was found to be
      slow, several hours of cooling being required for the system to return to its
      original state. Turbidity scans also revealed hysteresis between consecutive
      scans and a displacement of the depolymerization transition midpoint to a lower
      temperature than that of assembly. The disassembly of microtubules was examined
      in batch calorimetry experiments in pH 7.0 phosphate, 1 mM GTP, 16 mM MgCl2, and 
      3.4 M glycerol, in which tubulin assembled into microtubules was diluted to below
      the critical concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Design and synthesis of glucagon partial agonists and antagonists.
PG  - 8278-84
AB  - The hyperglycemia and ketosis of diabetes mellitus are generally associated with 
      elevated levels of glucagon in the blood. This suggests that glucagon is a
      contributing factor in the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes mellitus. A
      glucagon-receptor antagonist might provide important evidence for glucagons's
      role in this disease. In this work we describe how we combined structural
      modifications that led to glucagon analogues with partial agonist activity to
      give glucagon analogues that can act as competitive antagonists of
      glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Using solid-phase synthesis
      methodology and preparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography,
      we synthesized the following seven glucagon analogues and obtained them in high
      purity: [D-Phe4,Tyr5,Arg12]glucagon (2); [D-Phe4,Tyr5,Lys17,18]glucagon (3);
      [Phe1,Glu3,Lys17,18]glucagon (4); [Glu3,Val5,Lys17,18]glucagon (5);
      [Asp3,D-Phe4,Ser5,Lys17,18]glucagon (6); I4-[Asp3,D-Phe4,Ser5,Lys17,18]glucagon
      (7); [Pro3]glucagon (8). Purity was assessed by enzymatic total hydrolysis, by
      chymotryptic peptide mapping, and by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
      chromatography. The new analogues were tested for specific binding, for their
      effect on the adenylate cyclase activity in rat liver membranes, and for their
      effect on the blood glucose levels in normal rats relative to glucagon. Analogues
      showing no adenylate cyclase activity were examined for their ability to act as
      antagonists by displacing glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase dose-response
      curves to the right (higher concentrations). The binding potencies of the new
      analogues relative to glucagon (= 100) were respectively 1.0 (2), 1.3 (3), 3.8
      (4), 0.4 (5), 1.3 (6), 5.3 (7), and 3 (8). Glucagon analogues 3-5 and 8 were all 
      weak partial agonists with EC50 values of 500 (3), 250 (4), 1600 (5), and 395 nM 
      (8), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Absence of detectable ribonucleic acid in the purified, untransformed mouse
      glucocorticoid receptor.
PG  - 8266-73
AB  - The glucocorticoid receptor (GC-R) isolated from the mouse AtT-20 pituitary tumor
      cell line exists in three forms. The untransformed (non-DNA-binding), 9.1S
      species (319K) can be converted into two transformed (DNA-binding) species. One
      of these (5.2 S, Mr 132K) appears to be composed of one molecule of the
      hormone-binding, monomeric protein (96K) plus a small RNA, while the second
      transformed species is the monomeric, hormone-binding subunit (3.8 S, 96K)
      itself. We wished to determine whether the untransformed GC-R contains RNA or if 
      the monomer binds to RNA subsequent to subunit dissociation (which occurs during 
      receptor transformation). Kinetic studies using both the crude and purified
      untransformed GC-R show that the untransformed, 9.1S GC-R dissociates into 3.8S
      monomeric subunits, without forming a transient 5.2S complex. The untransformed
      receptor was then purified with affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and
      DEAE-cellulose chromatography. One major protein band, corresponding in size to
      the GC-R monomer (94K-96K), was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
      gels upon silver staining or fluorography of [3H]dexamethasone mesylate
      covalently labeled receptor. In vivo 32P-labeling of AtT-20 cells, followed by
      purification of the untransformed GC-R, yielded two major 32P-labeled components 
      (94K-96K and 24K). Both of these bands were protease-sensitive, contained
      phosphoserine, and were unaffected by ribonuclease treatment. We conclude that
      the untransformed mouse GC-R is wholly proteinaceous and contains no RNA. Thus,
      RNA binding occurs subsequent to dissociation of the oligomeric, untransformed
      GC-R complex into monomers.

TI  - Elasticity of synthetic phospholipid vesicles and submitochondrial particles
      during osmotic swelling.
PG  - 8220-9
AB  - A rapid and accurate method has been developed for measuring the elastic response
      of vesicle bilayer membranes to an applied osmotic pressure. The technique of
      dynamic light scattering is used to measure both the elastic constant and the
      elastic limit of dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) and DOPA-cholesterol vesicles
      and of submitochondrial particles derived from the inner membrane of bovine heart
      mitochondria. The vesicles prepared by the pH-adjustment method are unilamellar
      and of uniform size between 240 and 460 nm in diameter. The vesicles swell
      uniformly upon dilution. The observed change in size is not due to any change in 
      the shape of the vesicles. The data also indicate that the vesicles are spherical
      and not flaccid. The total vesicle swelling in these studies resulted in a 3-4%
      increase in surface area for vesicles swollen in 0.15 M KCl and a 5-10% increase 
      in surface area for vesicles swollen in 0.25 M sucrose. This maximum represents
      the elastic limit of the vesicles. Evidence is presented to show that the
      vesicles release contents after swelling to this maximum, reseal immediately, and
      reswell according to the osmotic pressure. For DOPA vesicles in a 0.15 M
      KCl-tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) buffer (pH 7.55),
      the observed membrane modulus is found to be in the range of 10(8) dyn/cm2. The
      modulus was found to be in the order of 10(7) dyn/cm2 for DOPA vesicles in a 0.25
      M sucrose-Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.55). This is comparable to that of
      submitochondrial particles in the same sucrose-Tris-HCl buffer. The observed
      membrane modulus also decreases with vesicle size. Its magnitude and its
      variation with ionic strength indicate that the major component of bilayer
      elasticity is neither the inherent elasticity of the bilayer nor the bending
      modulus. The variation of the membrane modulus with respect to curvature suggests
      that its principal component may be related to surface tension effects including 
      the negative charges on the vesicle surface. There is considerable variation
      between vesicles swollen in sucrose and those swollen in KCl in the membrane
      modulus, in the elastic limit at which the vesicles burst, and in the
      transbilayer pressure difference at bursting. The latter was found to be 4-6 mosM
      (10(5) dyn/cm2) in sucrose solution and 20-4 mosM (10(6) dyn/cm2) in KCl
      solution.

TI  - A test of discreteness-of-charge effects in phospholipid vesicles: measurements
      using paramagnetic amphiphiles.
PG  - 8214-9
AB  - A new series of negatively charged, paramagnetic alkylsulfonate probes was
      synthesized and can be used to measure both the internal and the external surface
      potentials of model membrane systems. We tested for discreteness-of-charge
      effects in lipid membranes by comparing the surface potentials, estimated by use 
      of these negatively charged amphiphiles, with that of a series of positively
      charged alkylammonium nitroxides in charged membranes. From the partitioning of
      these probes, the membrane surface potential was estimated in phosphatidylcholine
      membranes containing either phosphatidylserine or didodecyldimethylammonium
      bromide. The surface potentials, estimated with either positive or negative
      probes, were identical, within experimental error, in either positive or negative
      membranes, and they were well accounted for by a simple Gouy-Chapman-Stern
      theory. This symmetry, with respect to the sign of the charge, indicates that
      discreteness-of-charge effects are not significant in determining the
      potential-sensitive phase partitioning of these probes in model membranes. Thus, 
      despite the fact that charge on membranes is discrete, models that assume a
      uniform density of charge in the plane of the membrane adequately account for the
      potentials measured by these amphiphilic probes.

TI  - An experimental test of the discreteness-of-charge effect in positive and
      negative lipid bilayers.
PG  - 8206-14
AB  - The electrostatic properties of charged bilayers and the bilayer component of
      biological membranes are often described theoretically by assuming the charge is 
      smeared uniformly over the surface. This is one of the fundamental assumptions in
      the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) theory. However, the average distance between the
      charged phospholipids in a typical biological membrane is 2-3 nm, which is 2-3
      times the Debye length in a 0.1 M salt solution. Existing discreteness-of-charge 
      theories predict significant deviations from the GCS theory for the adsorption of
      ions to such membranes. We considered the predictions of the simplest
      discreteness-of-charge theory [Nelson, A. P., & McQuarrie, D. A. (1975) J. Theor.
      Biol. 55, 13-27], in which the charges are assumed to be fixed in a square
      lattice and the potential is described by the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann
      relation. This theory predicts deviations that are larger for counterions than
      for co-ions and much larger for divalent than for monovalent counterions. We
      tested these predictions by measuring the adsorption of a fluorescent monovalent 
      anion and a paramagnetic divalent cation to both positive and negative membranes,
      which we demonstrated experimentally had the same average surface potential. All 
      our experimental results with probes, including those obtained on membranes in
      the gel rather than in the liquid-crystalline state, agreed with the predictions 
      of the GCS theory rather than with the discreteness-of-charge theory. A simple
      calculation indicates that the agreement between the experimental results and the
      predictions of the GCS theory could be due to the finite size of the lipids.

TI  - Decarboxylation of oxalacetate by pyruvate carboxylase.
PG  - 8191-6
AB  - The decarboxylation of oxalacetate by pyruvate carboxylase in the absence of ADP 
      and Pi is stimulated 400-fold by the presence of oxamate, which is an inhibitory 
      analogue of pyruvate. The observation of substrate inhibition when either oxamate
      or oxalacetate is varied at a fixed concentration of the other indicates that
      both molecules bind at the same site on the enzyme. The pH profiles for this
      reaction show no evidence of the involvement of an enzymic acid-base catalyst,
      suggesting that the proton and CO2 units may be exchanged directly between the
      reactants (although CO2 sequestered in the active site may be an intermediate in 
      the process). The pH profiles of the full reverse reaction of pyruvate
      carboxylase in which oxalacetate decarboxylation is coupled to ATP formation and 
      where Pi is the variable substrate do, however, indicate that such an acid-base
      catalyst is involved in the other partial reaction of the enzyme in proton
      transfer to and from biotin. The enzyme also displays two oxamate-independent
      oxalacetate decarboxylating activities, one of which is biotin-dependent and the 
      other is independent of biotin.

      enzyme catalyzes the release of free Tyr-Gly from Leu-enkephalin (Km = 2.5
      microM) with an optimal activity between pH 6.0 and pH 8.0. The enzyme appears
      homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis devoid of detectable contaminating aminopeptidase activities. The
      native enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 51,000 +/- 1,000 
      and an isoelectric point of 4.6 +/- 0.1. This enzyme cosediments with
      synaptosomes on a Ficoll-sucrose gradient and is partially associated with
      synaptic plasma membranes. Its activity is inhibited by the metal-chelating
      agents ethylenediaminetetraacetate and o-phenanthroline. It is not inhibited by
      the OH-reactive agent phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and SH-reactive agents such 
      as p-(chloromercuri)benzoate and N-ethylmaleimide. Among the various biologically
      active peptides tested, the purified enzyme releases efficiently the N-terminal
      dipeptide moiety from enkephalins, Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 (CCK4), and
      Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 (CCK5). At variance, the native peptides CCK8, substance 
      P, neurotensin, and angiotensin II are not cleaved by the DAP. This enzyme is
      different from other unspecific DAPs, as well as from enkephalin-degrading DAPs
      previously reported, by its molecular weight and substrate specificity.

      parameters on transient kinetics.
PG  - 8141-9
AB  - Transient kinetic data of ATP binding and cleavage by cardiac myosin subfragment 
      1 (S1) were obtained by fluorescence stopped flow and analyzed by using computer 
      modeling based on a consecutive, reversible two-step mechanism: (formula: see
      text) where M1 and M12 denote myosin species with enhanced fluorescence and K'O =
      K0/(K0[ATP] + 1). The kinetic constants K0, k12, k23, and k32 and the fractional 
      contributions of M1 and M12 to the total fluorescence are analyzed over a range
      of systematically varied solution parameters. The initial ATP binding equilibrium
      (K0), which decreases with increasing pH, is facilitated by a positively charged 
      protein residue with a pK of 7.1. An active-site charge of +1.5 is determined
      from the ionic strength dependence. The rate constants k12, k23, and k32 also
      exhibit pK's near neutrality but increase with increasing pH. The majority of the
      large (-54 kJ/mol) negative free energy of ATP binding occurs upon S1
      isomerization, k12, and a large increase in entropy (183 J/kmol at 15 degrees C) 
      is associated with the cleavage step. The equilibrium constant for the cleavage
      step, K2, is determined as 3.5 at pH 7.0, 15 degrees C, and 200 mM ionic
      strength. There are no significant changes in fractional contributions to total
      fluorescence enhancement due to solvent-dependent conformational changes of S1 in
      these data. When values for the combined rate constants are calculated and
      compared with those determined by graphical analysis, it is observed that
      graphical analysis overestimates the binding rate constant (K0k12) by 25% and the
      hydrolysis rate constant (k23 + k32) by as much as 30%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

AB  - The effects of 0.09 saturated solutions of the n-alkanols n-hexanol to
      n-tridecanol on the surface (compensation) potential of lipid monolayers have
      been examined. Actions on monolayers spread from pure egg phosphatidylcholine
      have been compared with effects on a system containing 2:1 mole ratio of egg
      phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. The mean compensation potential for the pure
      phospholipid system was 475 +/- 9 mV; addition of cholesterol increased the
      potential to 503 +/- 10 mV. All n-alkanols tested reduced the surface potential
      in both systems. The reduction was larger in the pure phospholipid system but the
      difference in effect between lipid systems declined as the n-alkanol chainlength 
      increased, becoming negligible by n-tridecanol. These results are considered in
      relation to the 'cut-off' in biological activity of n-alkanols around
      n-tridecanol.

TI  - Functional reconstitution of carrier proteins by removal of detergent with a
      hydrophobic ion exchange column.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - A method has been developed for the functional reconstitution of membrane
      proteins in phospholipid vesicles. This method is an extension of a previously
      published procedure (Ueno, M., Tanford, C. and Reynolds, A. (1984) Biochemistry
      23, 3070-3076) for the formation of unilamellar vesicles from mixed micelles of
      egg phosphatidylcholine and dodecyl octaoxyethylene ether. Mixed micelles are
      formed from detergent-solubilized protein and egg-yolk phospholipid vesicles.
      These micelles are subjected to repeated passage through small columns filled
      with Amberlite XAD-2 beads. Several carrier proteins from the inner mitochondrial
      membrane have been reconstituted in this way; experimental data are shown for the
      aspartate/glutamate carrier and the ADP/ATP carrier. Certain parameters proved to
      be important for optimal efficiency of reconstitution: the ratio of
      detergent/phospholipid in the mixed micelles, the concentration of phospholipid
      during the hydrophobic chromatography, the ratio of phospholipid/protein, (d) the
      ratio of detergent/Amberlite XAD 2 beads, the number of column passages, and the 
      type of detergent. After optimization of these parameters, phospholipid vesicles 
      with a diameter of about 150 nm were obtained. The main advantage of this
      procedure, however, lies in the fact that high amounts of membrane protein can be
      incorporated into the phospholipid vesicles, i.e. up to 15% (w/w).

PG  - 277-81
AB  - The interaction of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 with phospholipid bilayers
      of liposomes made of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine was studied through the
      behavior of several physical properties. The dielectric permittivity spectra
      between 30 kHz and 13 MHz, the viscosity, the density, and the d.c. conductivity 
      (1 kHz) of aqueous liposomes suspensions at various mole ratios were measured at 
      22 degrees C. For detergent-to-phospholipid ratios lower than 3, a dielectric
      relaxation process of characteristic frequency of about 50 kHz was recorded. This
      process does not appear for the liposomes in water, and becomes smaller and
      smaller for detergent-to-phospholipid ratios higher than 3. The viscosity of
      these suspensions showed a biphasic behavior, being remarkably increased by the
      detergent for concentration ratios lower than 3. The measured d.c. conductivity
      of these samples showed no relation with this process, being slightly increased
      when the detergent content is increased. As a conclusion of these results a well 
      defined concentration range appears where the phospholipid organization changes
      forming highly asymmetrical structures.

PG  - 264-76
AB  - The size increase of small unilamellar vesicles composed of binary mixtures
      either of saturated fatty acid phosphatidylcholines with different chain lengths 
      or of saturated and unsaturated phosphatidylcholines was found to depend on the
      miscibility properties of the lipid components. No size increase was detected in 
      vesicles formed by two miscible phosphatidylcholines. In vesicles composed of two
      lipids which are partially immiscible in the gel state, a size increase was
      observed at temperatures which mainly overlapped the range of temperatures of the
      lipid phase transition. The rate of size increase of vesicles composed of two
      lipids which are immiscible in the gel state was faster than that of vesicles
      composed of two partially immiscible phosphatidylcholines, and the process
      occurred not only at the temperature ranges of the lipid phase transition, but
      also when both lipids were in the gel state. The vesicle size increase process
      occurred without the mixing of the internal content of the vesicles. A model is
      proposed in which the presence of 'fractures' between membrane regions of
      different fluidity and/or lipid composition controls the rate of this process.

TI  - Intrahepatic distribution of small unilamellar liposomes as a function of
      liposomal lipid composition.
PG  - 224-30
AB  - We investigated the intrahepatic distribution of small unilamellar liposomes
      injected intravenously into rats at a dose of 0.10 mmol of lipid per kg body
      weight. Sonicated liposomes consisting of cholesterol/sphingomyelin (1:1), (A);
      cholesterol/egg phosphatidylcholine (1:1), (B);
      cholesterol/sphingomyelin/phosphatidylserine (5:4:1), (C) or
      cholesterol/egg-phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (5:4:1), (D) were labeled 
      by encapsulation of [3H]inulin. The observed differences in rate of blood
      elimination and hepatic accumulation (A much less than B approximately equal to C
      less than D) confirmed earlier observations and reflected the rates of uptake of 
      the four liposome formulations by isolated liver macrophages in monolayer
      culture. Fractionation of the liver into a parenchymal and a non-parenchymal cell
      fraction revealed that 80-90% of the slowly clearing type-A liposomes were taken 
      up by the parenchymal cells while of the more rapidly eliminated type-B liposomes
      even more than 95% was associated with the parenchymal cells. Incorporation of
      phosphatidylserine into the sphingomyelin-based liposomes caused a significant
      increase in hepatocyte uptake but a much more substantial increase in
      non-parenchymal cell uptake, resulting in a major shift of the intrahepatic
      distribution towards the non-parenchymal cell fraction. For the
      phosphatidylcholine-based liposomes incorporation of phosphatidylserine did not
      increase the already high uptake by the parenchymal cells while uptake by the
      non-parenchymal cells was only moderately elevated; this resulted in only a small
      shift in distribution towards the non-parenchymal cells. The
      phosphatidylserine-induced increase in liposome uptake by non-parenchymal liver
      cells was paralleled by an increase in uptake by the spleen. Fractionation of the
      non-parenchymal liver cells in a Kupffer cell fraction and an endothelial cell
      fraction showed that even for the slowly eliminated liposomes of type A
      endothelial cells do not participate to a measurable extent in the elimination
      process, thus excluding involvement of fluid-phase pinocytosis in the uptake
      process.

TI  - Relation between lipid polymorphism and transbilayer movement of lipids in rat
      liver microsomes.
PG  - 193-204
AB  - We have studied the effects of trinitrophenylation on the transbilayer movement
      of phosphatidylcholine and the macroscopic lipid structure in rat liver
      microsomal membranes. The transbilayer movement of phosphatidylcholine was
      investigated using the PC-specific transfer protein. 31P-NMR was employed to
      monitor the phospholipid organization in intact microsomal vesicles. The results 
      indicate that modification of microsomes with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid
      enhances the transbilayer movement of phosphatidylcholine at 4 degrees C.
      Furthermore, phosphatidylethanolamine headgroup trinitrophenylation in microsomes
      increases the isotropic component in the 31P-NMR spectra even at 4 degrees C,
      possibly representing the appearance of intermediate non-bilayer lipid
      structures. The observed parallel between these data suggests that
      phosphatidylethanolamine molecules in the microsomal membrane, probably in
      combination with a protein component, are able to destabilize the bilayer
      organization, thereby facilitating the transmembrane movement of phospholipids.

TI  - The interaction of vitamin K1 with phospholipid vesicles.
PG  - 185-92
AB  - Vitamin K1 is a component of the electron transport chain in chloroplasts and
      also an activator of carboxylases present in microsomes of different tissues. In 
      order to understand its mechanism of action it is necessary to know its
      interactions, localization and organization in the phospholipid bilayer. We have 
      studied this question using reconstituted systems of vitamin K1 incorporated in
      DPPC multibilayer vesicles, using DSC, DPH anisotropy and FT-IR spectroscopy. DSC
      shows that the pretransition is modified and disappears as the concentration of
      vitamin K1 in the bilayer increases. The main transition is also affected, with a
      decrease of Tm and delta H with increasing concentrations of vitamin K1.
      Furthermore, a second peak appears at high concentrations of vitamin K1, which is
      indicative of a lateral phase separation of a phase rich in vitamin K1.
      Fluorescence measurements using DPH show, in agreement with the calorimetric
      measurements, that the phase transition is shifted to lower temperatures and the 
      anisotropy is increased above Tm but, interestingly, not below Tm. FT-IR
      spectroscopic measurements are also in good agreement with the calorimetric and
      fluorescence results, indicating that vitamin K1 induced a broadening and a shift
      to lower temperatures in the phase transition. It is deduced from the variation
      of the frequency parameter of the CH2 stretching vibration band with temperature 
      that vitamin K1 perturbs the average number of gauche and all-trans conformers of
      DPPC, only during the phase transition interval but neither at temperatures above
      nor below the phase transition. However, the bandwidth parameter of this
      vibration indicated a perturbation above, but not below, the phase transition.
      The possible relationship between these observations and those coming from
      fluorescence depolarization of DPH are discussed. Finally, it is concluded from
      the observation of the C=O stretching mode that vitamin K1 does not produce a
      very strong perturbation of the interfacial region of the membrane of the type
      given by, for example, cholesterol.

TI  - The effect of pH on the phase transition temperature of
      dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine-palmitic acid liposomes.
PG  - 156-64
AB  - The shift in the gel-liquid crystal phase transition temperature (tm) of
      dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes induced by incorporation of 10 mol%
      palmitic acid, was measured by 90 degrees light scattering at different bulk pH
      values. It has been found that the tm shift decreases sigmoidally from 4.7 to
      -0.3 degrees C as the bulk pH is raised from 5 to 11. Since it is in this range
      that the carboxyl group of a membrane-bound fatty acid should ionize, our results
      can be interpreted to mean that there is relationship between the tm shift and
      the degree of dissociation of palmitic acid, the uncharged fatty acid increasing 
      tm and its conjugate, anionic form, slightly decreasing the transition
      temperature of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes. The experimental results
      are fitted by a modified form of the Henderson-Hasselbach equilibrium expression 
      which takes into account the effect of the anionic fatty acid on the surface
      potential and hence, on the surface pH of liposomes, according to Gouy-Chapman
      and Boltzmann equations, respectively. Best fit between theory and experiments is
      found when the intrinsic interfacial pK of palmitic acid is set equal to 7.7.
      This high pK value can be explained as due to the effect of the lower dielectric 
      constant of the interfacial region, as compared to bulk water, on the acid-base
      dissociation of the carboxyl group. The results presented here show that upon
      incorporation of palmitic acid, the phase transition of
      dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers becomes extremely sensitive to changes of
      pH in the vicinity of the physiological range. This property is not shown by the 
      pure phospholipid bilayers in the same pH range.

TI  - Visualization of domains in rigid ganglioside/phosphatidylcholine bilayers: Ca2+ 
      effects.
PG  - 139-55
AB  - We have considered the extent to which details of lectin binding directly
      visualized by freeze-etch electron microscopy are consistent with current
      concepts of ganglioside arrangement in phosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes.
      Native lectins in general seem appropriate labels for this type of study. Wheat
      germ agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin, and peanut agglutinin are
      adequately resolved on membrane surfaces as spherical particles of diameters 6
      nm, 10 nm, and 13 nm, respectively (uncorrected for platinum shadow thickness).
      The finite areas covered by these markers correspond to some 56, 157, and 265
      lipid molecules, respectively, on the surfaces of the shadowed rigid
      phosphatidylcholine matrices employed here; and this constitutes a basic
      limitation to the precision with which one can localize a given glycolipid
      receptor. Ricinus communis agglutinin provides a marker whose size permits
      adequate quantitation of bound material while minimally obscuring detail. Using
      it we estimated the size limits of GM1-enriched domains, since this is the
      ganglioside which has shown the greatest evidence of discontinuous distribution
      in our hands (Peters, M.W., Mehlhorn, I.E., Barber, K.R. and Grant, C.W.M. (1984)
      Biochim. Biophys. Acta 778, 419-428). Results of such analyses indicate the
      probable existence of phase separated domains selectively enriched in GM1 up to
      60 nm in extent (5600 lipid molecules) for rigid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
      membranes bearing up to 14 mol% GM1. Similar observations were true of rigid
      bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; however, if domains enriched in GM1
      exist in fluid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, they are on the order of 6 nm or
      less in diameter (or are dispersed by lectin binding). Employing the small
      lectin, wheat germ agglutinin, which binds to all gangliosides, we then examined 
      the effect of exposure to Ca2+ ions (while in the fluid state) on the ganglioside
      'domain structure' referred to above in rigid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine host
      matrices. GM1, GD1a and GT1b were studied at 0, 2 and 10 mM Ca2+ concentrations. 
      It was demonstrated by spin label measurements that the
      dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine matrix retained its basic melting characteristics 
      in the presence of added Ca2+ and ganglioside under these conditions. Within the 
      technique's functional resolution limit of some 6 nm we were unable to identify
      any effect of Ca2+ in physiological concentration on ganglioside topography as
      reflected by bound lectin distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

PG  - 129-38
AB  - A study has been conducted of the interaction of the lytic toxin delta-haemolysin
      with vesicles of phospholipid, using electron microscopy, fluorescence
      depolarisation and excimer fluorescence. The peptide is shown to be a fusogen
      towards phosphatidylcholine vesicles in fluid phases. In the presence of gel
      phase lipid, fusion between fluid and gel phases is not seen. Fluid phase lipid
      vesicles are fused together to form large multilamellar structures, and initial
      vesicle size does not appear to be important since small unilamellar vesicles and
      large unilamellar vesicles are similarly affected. Fusogenic activity of
      delta-haemolysin is compared to that of melittin. The former is a progressive
      fusogen for fluid phase lipid, while the latter causes vesicle fusion in a manner
      related to occurrence of a lipid phase transition.

TI  - Glucose homeostasis in rats treated acutely and chronically with quinine.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - Glucose homeostasis in normal rats was studied after chronic or acute
      administration of quinine. Male rats received a daily dose of 10-30 mg/kg of
      quinine in the drinking water for 20 weeks. The high dose caused a slight
      decrease in food intake and weight gain. Though basal plasma insulin levels were 
      increased in treated rats, their plasma glucose levels were only slightly and not
      consistently decreased. After oral or intravenous administration of glucose, the 
      plasma insulin levels were higher and the disappearance rate of glucose was
      greater in rats receiving quinine than in the controls. The insulin content of
      the pancreas was not affected by quinine treatment. Intraperitoneal injection of 
      a high dose of quinine (30 mg/kg) transiently increased plasma glucose and
      insulin levels. The insulin response was increased during a subsequent
      administration of glucose but the glucose levels were not modified. This study
      shows that chronic administration of quinine increases plasma insulin levels,
      accelerates disposal of oral or intravenous glucose but does not cause
      hypoglycaemia in normal rats.

TI  - Aminoacyl-tRNA-elongation factor Tu-ribosome interaction leading to hydrolysis of
      guanosine 5'-triphosphate.
PG  - 8330-6
AB  - We investigated the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) dependent binding of Phe-tRNA
      and Phe-tRNAs with the nicks at positions 46, 37, and 17 to the Escherichia coli 
      70S ribosome-poly(U)-tRNAPhe complex. Binding of Phe-tRNA1-45 + 47-76,
      Phe-tRNA1-36 + 38-76, or Phe-tRNA1-16 + 17-76 to the 70S ribosome has been found 
      to be poly(U) X tRNA dependent and, similar to that of intact Phe-tRNA, is
      inhibited by the antibiotic thiostrepton. We have further found that, contrary to
      a previous report [Modolell, J., Cabrer, B., Parmeggiani, A., & Vazquez, D.
      (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 68, 1796], the EF-Tu-ribosome GTPase
      mediated by Phe-tRNA is not inhibited by thiostrepton; rather, the drug
      stimulates the endogenous GTPase of the EF-Tu X 70S ribosome. Phe-tRNA fragments 
      47-76, 38-76, and 17-76 all promote the EF-Tu X GTPase reaction in the presence
      of 70S ribosome-poly(U)-tRNAPhe yeast. Moreover, since the GTPase-promoting
      activities of both the short and long fragments are similar, it appears that the 
      most important aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid (aa-tRNA) interaction with
      EF-Tu occurs alongside its 3' quarter. Thiostrepton slightly stimulates the
      GTPase activity of these Phe-tRNA fragments. Although the Phe-tRNA1-36 + 38-76
      cannot bind to poly(U) during its binding to 70S ribosomes, its binding at high
      Mg2+ concentration occurs at the A site. Thus, most of the bound modified
      Phe-tRNA functions as the acceptor in the peptidyltransferase reaction.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Dissociation of the lactose repressor protein tetramer using high hydrostatic
      pressure.
PG  - 8308-15
AB  - Dissociation of lac repressor tetramer by high hydrostatic pressures was
      monitored with intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. With the assumption of complete
      dissociation to monomer, tryptophan polarization data gave delta V a
      approximately 170 mL/mol and the concentration for 50% tetramer dissociation,
      C1/2, was 3.8 X 10(-8) M. Upon addition of inducer, the calculated delta V a
      increased to approximately 220 mL/mol and the C1/2 decreased to approximately 1 X
      10(-8) M, a free energy difference of approximately 0.7 kcal. These results
      indicate a modest stabilization of the tetramer by the presence of inducer.
      Monitoring the average energy of tryptophan emission demonstrated that tetramer
      dissociation takes place over the same range of pressures as evidenced by the
      polarization data and IPTG dissociation can be more or less superimposed upon
      tetramer dissociation depending upon the ligand concentration used. Although the 
      two transitions cannot be separated entirely, the delta V a for the region of the
      pressure dependence dominated by ligand dissociation was 69 mL/mol, an
      unexpectedly large value. For tetramer modified with methyl methanethiosulfonate,
      subunit dissociation was shifted to much higher pressures and IPTG dissociation
      did not occur. The delta V a for subunit association was calculated as
      approximately 160 mL/mol, and the C1/2 was 3.5 X 10(-9) M. Interactions at the
      subunit interface of the modified protein are apparently stronger than in the
      unmodified protein. The absence of inducer dissociation from the MMTS-modified
      tetramer by the application of high hydrostatic pressure suggests that the volume
      change for inducer binding to the modified protein is much smaller than that
      observed for the unmodified repressor.

TI  - Demonstration of the GC-rich common arm in yeast ribosomal 5.8S RNA via 500-MHz
      proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Overhauser enhancements.
PG  - 8245-52
AB  - In this paper we report the first 1H NMR study of the base-paired secondary
      structure of yeast 5.8S RNA. On the basis of a combination of homonuclear
      Overhauser enhancements and temperature dependence of the proton 500-MHz NMR
      spectrum, we are able to identify and assign eight of the nine base pairs in the 
      most thermally stable helical arm: G116.C137-C117.G136-C118.G135-
      C119.G134-C120.G133-U121.G132- U122.A131-G123.C130. This arm contains an
      unusually temperature-stable (to 71 degrees C) segment of four consecutive G.C
      base pairs. This work constitutes the most direct evidence to date for the
      existence and base-pair sequence of the GC-rich helix, which is common to most
      currently popular secondary structural models for eukaryotic 5.8S ribosomal RNA.

TI  - Membrane disposition of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease: identification of
      membrane-bound and cytoplasmic domains.
PG  - 8230-4
AB  - Two proteolytic fragments of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease (EIImtl) have
      been identified on autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels
      and mapped with respect to the membrane. EIImtl was selectively radiolabeled with
      either [35S]methionine or a mixture of 14C-labeled amino acids in E. coli
      minicells harboring a plasmid containing the mannitol operon. The intact permease
      (Mr 65,000) in everted vesicles derived from labeled minicells was cleaved by
      mild trypsinolysis into two smaller fragments (Mr 34,000 and 29,000). The
      34,000-dalton fragment remained in the membrane and was insensitive to further
      proteolysis by trypsin. This fragment was identified as the N-terminal half of
      the protein by comparing the amount of the original [35S]methionine label that it
      retained with the known differential distribution of methionine in the two halves
      of EIImtl. The 29,000-dalton fragment, which was released into the soluble
      fraction and was sensitive to further trypsinolysis, therefore corresponds to the
      C-terminal half of the mannitol permease. Both fragments were shown to be
      antigenically related to EIImtl by immunoblotting with anti-EIImtl antibody. The 
      34,000-dalton fragment was further shown to form an oligomer under conditions
      which allow the intact enzyme to dimerize, suggesting that this domain plays an
      important role in EIImtl subunit interactions. These results support a model in
      which EIImtl consists of two domains of approximately equal size: a
      membrane-bound, N-terminal domain with a tendency to self-associate, and a
      cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Identification of the high-affinity lipid binding site in Escherichia coli
      pyruvate oxidase.
PG  - 8178-83
AB  - Pyruvate oxidase from Escherichia coli is a peripheral membrane associated enzyme
      which is activated by lipids. We have investigated the high-affinity lipid
      binding site associated with lipid activation of pyruvate oxidase by covalent
      attachment of [14C]lauric acid to the enzyme. Lauric acid is bound
      stoichiometrically (1 mol/mol of active sites), and the enzyme is essentially
      irreversibly activated. Mild tryptic digestion of the modified enzyme shows that 
      the lauric acid is bound within the last 100 residues of the 572-residue monomer.
      Digestion with thermolysin releases two closely related peptides, A and B, in
      approximately equal amounts. Comparison of the amino acid composition of peptide 
      A with the entire sequence of the protein shows that peptide A corresponds to the
      sequence from Ala-543 to Ile-554. The analysis of peptide B is very similar to
      that of A. Limited sequence analysis of peptide B shows that residue 1 is Ala and
      residue 2 is labeled. These results support the assignment of residue 1 in
      peptide B as Ala-543 and indicate that lauric acid is bound to Lys-544. Previous 
      work in this laboratory has shown that pyruvate oxidase may be activated
      independently of lipids by mild protease digestion. Proteolytic activation is
      accompanied by the release of a small peptide (residues 550-572) from the
      carboxyl terminus of the protein. The present work locates the lipid binding site
      very close to this peptide. The significance of these results for the mechanism
      of activation of pyruvate oxidase and other lipid-activated systems is discussed.

TI  - Chemical modification of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase by diethyl
      pyrocarbonate: evidence of histidine requirement for enzyme activity and
      intrinsic zinc binding.
PG  - 8167-72
AB  - RNA polymerase (RPase) from Escherichia coli contains five subunits (alpha 2 beta
      beta' sigma) and two intrinsic Zn ions located in the beta and beta' subunits.
      This enzyme was rapidly inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP) at pH 6.0 and 
      25 degrees C. The difference spectrum of the DEP-inactivated and native RPases
      showed a single peak at 240 nm indicating the formation of
      N-carbethoxyhistidines. No decrease in absorbance at 278 nm, due to
      O-carbethoxytyrosine, or modification of amino and sulfhydryl groups was
      observed. Inactivated RPase with six to nine histidines being modified could be
      fully reactivated by incubation with 0.5 M hydroxylamine at pH 6.0 and room
      temperature for 1 h. No structural difference was detected between the native and
      modified enzymes as evidenced by UV/visible and fluorescence spectra, sodium
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic pattern, or gel filtration
      properties. Substrate ATP at 0.11 and 1.14 mM concentrations provided,
      respectively, 25% and 90% protection against DEP inactivation, while template DNA
      did not. These results suggest that one or more histidine residues is/are in
      close proximity to the substrate binding site. The pH dependence of the DEP
      inactivation of RPase suggested the modification of histidine at the active site 
      with a pK value of 6.9. The inactivation of RPase by DEP and the formation of
      N-carbethoxyhistidine displayed a similar second-order rate constant of
      approximately 0.9 mM-1 min-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Photochemical properties of Escherichia coli DNA photolyase: a flash photolysis
      study.
PG  - 8163-6
AB  - Escherichia coli DNA photolyase contains a stable flavin neutral blue radical
      that is involved in photosensitized repair of pyrimidine dimers in DNA. We have
      investigated the effect of illumination on the radical using light of lambda
      greater than 520 nm from either a camera flash or laser. We find that both types 
      of irradiations result in the photoreduction of the flavin radical with a quantum
      yield of 0.10 +/- 0.02. While photoreduction with the camera flash is minimal in 
      the absence of an electron donor (dithiothreitol), laser flash photolysis at 532 
      nm reduces the flavin to the same extent in the presence or absence or an
      electron donor. Thus, it is concluded that the primary step in photoreduction
      involves an electron donor that is a constituent of the enzyme itself. Laser
      flash photolysis produces a transient absorption band at 420 nm that probably
      represents the absorption of the lowest excited doublet state (2(1)IIII*) of the 
      radical and decays with first-order kinetics with k1 = 0.8 X 10(6) s-1. The
      photoreduction data combined with the results of recent studies on the activity
      of dithionite-reduced enzyme suggest that electron donation by excited states of 
      E-FADH2 is the mechanism of flavin photosensitized dimer repair by E. coli DNA
      photolyase.

TI  - Unilateral intranigral injection of MPTP in the rat induces contraversive
      turning.
PG  - 295-7
AB  - Unilateral injection of MPTP into the pars compacta of the substantia nigra in
      rats induced contraversive turning immediately after the injection. Contraversive
      turning decreased, and reversed its direction after about 30 min. Ipsiversive
      turning was still present 24 h after the injection of MPTP. These results suggest
      that MPTP has an initial stimulatory effect on dopaminergic neurons followed by a
      depression of the activity of these cells.

TI  - The effects of bepridil, compared with calcium-channel inhibitors and calmodulin 
      antagonists on both spontaneous activity and contractions induced by potassium or
      phenylephrine in rat portal vein.
PG  - 187-96
AB  - Bepridil is known to block calcium channels in some vascular tissues. Recent work
      has shown that bepridil also antagonises calmodulin. The present study attempted 
      to more fully characterize the vasodilator actions of bepridil by comparing it
      with the known calcium channel blocking drugs, nifedipine, diltiazem, verapamil
      and flunarizine, the calmodulin inhibitors, trifluoperazine and W7 and
      propylmethylenedioxyindene, which is thought to act intracellularly, on rat
      portal vein. The relative activities of the test drugs were compared on
      spontaneous activity and on all components of the contractile responses to
      potassium and phenylephrine. Bepridil inhibited all components of the potassium
      and phenylephrine responses equally, actions similar to those of the
      intracellular acting drugs. The exception to this was trifluoperazine which also 
      exerted alpha-adrenoceptor blocking actions. In contrast the calcium channel
      blocking drugs, with the exception of verapamil, inhibited the tonic component of
      both spasmogen responses more than the phasic component. Bepridil like the
      intracellular acting drugs, but unlike the calcium channel blockers, markedly
      increased the frequency of spontaneous contractions whilst reducing amplitude. It
      is concluded that the profile of bepridil on rat portal vein more closely
      resembles that of intracellularly acting drugs than that of classical calcium
      channel inhibitors.

TI  - Calcitonin gene-related peptide excites myenteric neurons.
PG  - 163-70
AB  - Intracellular methods were used to record electrical behavior of myenteric
      neurons in guinea-pig ileum in vitro. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 1 nM
      to 1 microM) and calcitonin (1-100 microM) were applied by addition to the
      superfusion solution of longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations. Both
      peptides were applied also by pressure ejection from fine-tipped micropipettes.
      CGRP, applied by either method, evoked a long-lasting depolarization of the cell 
      membranes that was dose-dependent (ED50 = 50 nM) and was associated with an
      increase in the input resistance, suppression of post-spike hyperpolarizing
      potentials and enhanced excitability in all neurons that were tested. The
      enhanced excitability was reflected by a significant increase in the number of
      action potentials evoked by intracellular injection of constant current
      depolarizing pulses. Enhanced excitability also was apparent as a train of spikes
      that appeared at the crests of the CGRP-induced depolarization. The excitatory
      action of CGRP simulated slow synaptic excitation. Application of calcitonin did 
      not evoke any changes in electrical behavior of myenteric neurons. The results
      are consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role for CGRP in the
      enteric nervous system and suggest that it may participate in local neurohumoral 
      regulation of gastrointestinal effector systems.

TI  - Structure of unfolded and refolded recombinant derived [Ala125]interleukin 2.
PG  - 8274-7
AB  - Naturally occurring interleukin 2 (IL-2) contains an odd number (three) of
      cysteinyl residues and thus is susceptible to the formation of a variety of
      intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds. The cysteine at residue 125
      has been replaced with an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis, and
      hence, this analogue can form only one intrachain disulfide bond. When expressed 
      at high levels in Escherichia coli, this recombinant DNA derived IL-2 analogue is
      insoluble, reduced, and inactive. The protein was solubilized by denaturants and,
      after purification, was oxidized to form an intramolecular disulfide bond.
      Circular dichroism (CD) has been used to investigate the effects of various
      denaturants on the unfolding-refolding process of the purified, oxidized protein.
      A similar conformation is obtained when [Ala125]interleukin 2 [IL-2(Ala-125)] is 
      refolded from 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 8 M urea, or 5% acetic acid. The
      resultant protein, refolded from these denaturants, is monomeric and has activity
      comparable to or greater than that reported for naturally derived IL-2. In
      addition to this form, aggregates, as evidenced from gel filtration, are
      obtained. The specific activities of these are greatly reduced, and CD spectra
      indicated that they have much less helical content than the monomeric form of the
      protein. CD spectra also showed that the tertiary structure of IL-2(Ala-125) is
      entirely different in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) from that of
      the monomeric form in the absence of SDS.

      regulation.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - The effects of local application in the nucleus tractus solitarii of different
      serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists were investigated in anesthesized
      rats. Unilateral microinjection of serotonin produced an acute and transient
      hypotension and bradycardia which could be totally blocked by antagonists acting 
      preferentially upon 5-HT2 receptor binding sites: ketanserin and ritanserin.
      5-HT1 receptor agonists such as RU-24969 and
      8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin failed to reproduce the acute
      cardiovascular effects of serotonin. Bilateral microinjection of 5-HT2 receptor
      antagonists produced an increase in the level and in the variability of arterial 
      pressure but did not block the baroreceptor reflex arc. The data suggest that
      serotonin acting upon 5-HT2 receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarii plays an
      important role in the modulation of arterial pressure.

TI  - Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase of Escherichia coli. Formation of
      8-S-acetyldihydrolipoamide.
PG  - 8173-8
AB  - The dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component (E2) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
      complex catalyzes the reaction of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) with
      dihydrolipoamide, producing coenzyme A and S-acetyldihydrolipoamide. The acetyl
      group is shown by experiments reported herein to be bonded to S8 in the enzymatic
      product. 1H NMR analysis of synthetic samples of both structural isomers of
      S-acetyl-S-(phenylmercurio)dihydrolipoamide enabled structural assignments to be 
      made. Reaction of 8-S-acetyl-6-S-(phenylmercurio)dihydrolipoamide with
      3-mercaptopropionic acid in chloroform produced 8-S-acetyldihydrolipoamide which 
      contained a small amount (5%) of the 6-S isomer. Reaction of
      6,8-di-S-acetyldihydrolipoamide with NH2OH produced a 4:1 mixture of
      6-S-acetyldihydrolipoamide and the 8-S isomer. These compounds did not isomerize 
      at significant rates in chloroform but rapidly isomerized to the equilibrium
      mixture in aqueous solution (Keq = 3.4). The second-order rate constants for the 
      hydroxide-catalyzed isomerization were found to be kf = (1.15 +/- 0.07) X 10(6)
      M-1 X s-1 and kr = (3.36 +/- 0.20) X 10(5) M-1 X s-1 in the direction of the
      formation of the 8-S isomer. The enzymatic product was trapped by addition of
      phenylmercuric hydroxide within 15 s-30 min after starting the reaction. 1H NMR
      analysis of the products obtained at various times showed that the enzymatic
      product was 8-S-acetyldihydrolipoamide, which underwent progressive isomerization
      to the mixture of isomers within a few minutes. In the reaction of acetyl-CoA
      with dihydrolipoamide, the latter substrate reacts in place of enzyme-bound
      dihydrolipoyl moieties. Therefore, acetylation occurs at the 8-S position of
      bound lipoyl groups.

TI  - Assessment of binding of L-cystine and L-lysine by rat renal brush-border
      membranes.
PG  - 332-6
AB  - Cystine and lysine bind to isolated rat renal brush-border vesicles. Three
      methods to determine the extent of amino acid binding to the membranes have been 
      compared, one relying on the osmotic reactivity of the vesicle, a second by
      trichloroacetic acid precipitation of membrane-bound material and a third by
      initial rate analysis. For cystine, all methods yield comparable results at early
      time points, indicating the trichloroacetic acid method is a simple and valuable 
      tool for binding estimation under initial-rate or near initial-rate conditions.
      For lysine, initial rate analysis and osmotic perturbation are the methods of
      choice since lysine co-precipitates with trichloroacetic acid.

PG  - 305-8
AB  - Field stimulation of isolated rat vas deferens preparations caused a twitch
      contraction followed by a slower phasic contraction. Exogenously applied ATP and 
      noradrenaline caused rapid contractions and slowly developing contractions
      respectively. Pretreatment with phentolamine antagonised the phasic response to
      stimulation and the contraction to noradrenaline. Pretreatment with AMP
      antagonized the twitch response to stimulation and concentrations to ATP. The
      results support the view that ATP is released as a co-transmitter with
      noradrenaline in sympathetic nerves.

TI  - Influence of Ca2+e on 5-HT2- and alpha 1-induced arterial contraction and
      phosphoinositide metabolism.
PG  - 253-7
AB  - Serotonin and phenylephrine were found to induce contractile responses and
      inositol phosphate (IP) formation in isolated rat tail artery. Both processes
      displayed similar concentration dependence in the presence of 2.5 mM external
      calcium (Ca2+e) and both were respectively inhibited by either ketanserine or
      prazosin, depending on the agonist used. In the absence of Ca2+e the amines no
      longer produced a contractile effect. In addition, lack of Ca2+ caused a shift to
      the right in the dose-response curve for phenylephrine-induced IP formation
      whereas serotonin-induced IP formation was not affected by changes in Ca2+e. The 
      results suggest that alpha 1- and 5-HT2-induced contractions are quantitatively
      related to phosphatidylinositol metabolism. Contraction, but not IP formation
      requires the presence of Ca2+e. Different effects of Ca2+e on phenylephrine- and 
      serotonin-induced IP formation could be related to a differential Ca2+ effect on 
      binding of alpha 1- or 5-HT2 agonists.

PG  - 237-44
AB  - Administration of the opiate U-50,488H (3-20 mg/kg s.c.), a selective kappa
      receptor agonist, produced a dose-dependent decrease of rectal temperature in
      rats. This hypothermic effect of U-50,488H was accompanied by an enhanced
      activity of Ca2+/Mg2+ ATPase in crude synaptosomal (P2) fractions obtained from
      hypothalamus but not from cortex or cerebellum. Mg2+ ATPase activity in these
      regions was not altered by U-50,488H (15 mg/kg s.c.). Naloxone (5 mg/kg)
      partially and MR2266 (5 mg/kg) completely reversed the temperature and enzyme
      changes. Pretreatment with the calcium channel blockers nimodipine (1 mg/kg
      s.c.), diltiazem (10 mg/kg s.c.) and verapamil (2.5 mg/kg s.c.) potentiated the
      hypothermic effect of U-50,488H as well as the stimulation of Ca2+/Mg2+ ATPase in
      hypothalamus. These observations suggest that kappa agonists may produce opiate
      receptor mediated hypothermia through changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels in the
      hypothalamus.

TI  - Modulation by cyclic AMP of arachidonic acid-induced platelet desensitization.
PG  - 219-28
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that arachidonic acid (AA) and the stable cyclic 
      endoperoxide analogue (U46619) desensitize human platelets at a common site,
      which is sensitive to endoperoxides/thromboxane receptor antagonists. We now
      report on the influence of agents which evaluate intracellular levels of platelet
      adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) on AA- and U46619-induced platelet
      desensitization. Prostaglandin E1, prostacyclin, carbacyclin, forskolin or
      dibutyryl cAMP prevented platelet activation by and desensitization to AA and to 
      U46619 under conditions where the formation of thromboxane B2 was not
      significantly modified. Inhibition of platelet activation (aggregation and
      secretion) required a lower increase of the cAMP content than was needed to
      inhibit desensitization, confirming previous findings that desensitization to and
      by AA or U46619 are independent from the platelet release reaction. Together,
      these results indicate that AA-induced desensitization can be modulated by the
      adenylate cyclase/cAMP system acting at a site distinct from the known mechanisms
      of Ca2+ sequestration. This site is shared by the AA metabolite responsible for
      desensitization and by U46619 and is related to their common platelet membrane
      receptor.

TI  - High affinity and low affinity ouabain binding sites in the rat heart.
PG  - 137-46
AB  - Ventricular muscle of rat heart has two classes of receptors which are
      responsible for the positive inotropic effect of ouabain. Low affinity receptors 
      are apparently related to Na+, K+-ATPase. To determine if high affinity receptors
      are also sarcolemmal Na+, K+-ATPase of muscle cells, their characteristics were
      examined. Binding of [3H]ouabain to the high affinity binding site required ATP
      in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+, was stimulated by Na+ in the presence of Mg2+
      and ATP, and was inhibited by K+. Digoxin, digitoxin and cassaine all inhibited
      [3H]ouabain binding to the high affinity site. Cassaine was about an order of
      magnitude less potent than the glycosides. These results indicate similarities in
      high affinity ouabain binding sites in ventricular muscle of rat heart and Na+,
      K+-ATPase obtained from other sources. Destruction of sympathetic nerve terminals
      with 6-hydroxydopamine failed to affect the high affinity ouabain binding sites
      indicating that high affinity sites do not represent the Na+, K+-ATPase in
      sympathetic nerve terminals. Labeling of Na+, K+-ATPase from [gamma-32P]ATP
      indicates that high affinity ouabain binding sites account for 25% of the total
      enzyme molecules present in ventricular muscle of rat heart.

TI  - Anticholinesterase activity and structure activity relationships of a new series 
      of hemicholinium-3 analogs.
PG  - 107-14
AB  - Piperidine derivatives of hemicholinium-3 were synthesized and included the
      following spacing groups between the bis-cationic heads:
      trans,trans-bicyclohexyl, phenanthrene, naphthalene and biphenyl.
      Anticholinesterase activity was determined using rat striatal synaptosomal
      cholinesterase, bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase and horse serum
      butyrylcholinesterase. Hemicholinium-3 has little anticholinesterase activity but
      when the choline moiety of hemicholinium-3 is replaced with selected heterocyclic
      amine ring systems active inhibitors can be obtained. Results in this
      communication identify several quaternary amines which are equipotent with
      physostigmine for inhibition of cholinesterase. Several tertiary amines were also
      found to be active. Optimal anticholinesterase activity of these piperidine
      derivatives appear to be related to the necessity of 14 A interatomic distance
      between the cationic heads as well as C = O substitution in the phenylethyl
      spacing moiety. Reduction of C = O to secondary alcohol or CH2 results in
      decreased activity. The anticholinesterase activity is not only related to
      internitrogen distance and C = O substitution but also structural planarity and
      positional isomerism of the quaternary cationic head.

TI  - S-adenosylhomocysteinase: mechanism of reversible and irreversible inactivation
      by ATP, cAMP, and 2'-deoxyadenosine.
PG  - 8337-42
AB  - Homogeneous S-adenosylhomocysteinase (AdoHcyase) from rat liver is a tetrameric
      enzyme that contains four molecules of tightly bound NAD per mole of enzyme. We
      report here that incubation of the rat liver enzyme with ATP, Mg2+, and KCl leads
      to conversion of the active enzyme to an inactive form with release of all
      enzyme-bound NAD which can be recovered quantitatively by gel filtration. At
      various concentrations of ATP, the release of NAD corresponds closely with the
      degree of inactivation, suggesting that the four subunits are equivalent.
      Hydrolysis of ATP is not required for the inactivation process since
      nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues can replace ATP in the inactivation process. The
      ATP-dependent inactivation is fully reversible upon incubation of the inactivated
      enzyme with NAD. The ATP-dependent inactivation of the enzyme appears to be
      analogues to the cAMP-dependent inactivation of the enzyme from Dictyostelium
      discoideum described earlier by Hohman et al. (1985) [Hohman, R. J., Guitton, M. 
      C., & Veron, M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 4578-4581; Hohman, R.
      J., Veron, M., & Guitton, M. C. (1985) Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 26, 233-245] but
      differs from the irreversible inactivation studied earlier by Abeles et al.
      (1982) [Abeles, R. H., Fish, S., & Lapinskas, B. (1982) Biochemistry 21,
      5557-5562]. These authors have ascribed the time-dependent inactivation that
      results from incubation of the enzyme with 2'-deoxyadenosine at the C-3' and
      concluded that AdoHcyase "probably consists of two nonequivalent pairs of
      subunits".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Mass action analysis of kinetics and extent of fusion between Sendai virus and
      phospholipid vesicles.
PG  - 8261-6
AB  - The kinetics and extent of fusion between Sendai virus particles and liposomes
      were investigated with an assay for lipid mixing based on the relief of
      self-quenching of fluorescence. The measurements, which were carried out at pH
      7.4 and 5.0, included liposomes of three compositions, cardiolipin (CL),
      CL/dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (CL/DOPC 1:1), and phosphatidylserine (PS).
      Liposomal lipid concentrations varied from 2.5 to 50 microM. In addition, the
      effect of low concentrations of the dehydrating agent poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
      on fusion between the virus and the liposomes at pH 7.4 was studied. The results 
      were analyzed in terms of a mass action kinetic model which views the overall
      fusion reaction as a sequence of a second-order process of virus-liposome
      adhesion or aggregation, followed by the first-order fusion reaction itself. The 
      fusion products were shown to consist of a single virus particle and several
      liposomes. Analytical solutions were found for the final extent of fusion and
      increase in fluorescence intensity following the fusion of fluorescently labeled 
      virus particles with liposomes. The final extents of fluorescence intensity were 
      explained by assuming an essentially irreversible binding of liposomes to
      inactive virus particles. The percents of active virus particles and the rate
      constants of fusion and aggregation were larger at pH 5 than at pH 7.4, increased
      when PEG was included in the medium, and varied with liposomal lipid composition 
      according to the sequence CL greater than CL/DOPC greater than PS.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Parameters affecting fusion between Sendai virus and liposomes. Role of viral
      proteins, liposome composition, and pH.
PG  - 8252-60
AB  - A kinetic and quantitative characterization of the fusion process between Sendai 
      virus and phospholipid vesicles is presented. Membrane fusion was monitored in a 
      direct and continuous manner by employing an assay which relies on the relief of 
      fluorescence self-quenching of the probe octadecylrhodamine B chloride which was 
      located in the viral membrane. Viral fusion activity was strongly dependent on
      the vesicle lipid composition and was most efficient with vesicles solely
      consisting of acidic phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin (CL). This result
      implies that the fusion of viruses with liposomes does not display an absolute
      requirement for specific membrane receptors. Incorporation of phosphatidylcholine
      (PC), rather than phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), into CL bilayers strongly
      inhibited fusion, suggesting that repulsive hydration forces interfere with the
      close approach of viral and target membrane. Virus-liposome fusion products were 
      capable of fusing with liposomes, but not with virus. In contrast to fusion with 
      erythrocyte membranes, fusion between virus and acidic phospholipid vesicles was 
      triggered immediately, did not strictly depend on viral protein conformation, and
      did not display a pH optimum around pH 7.5. On the other hand, with vesicles
      consisting of PC, PE, cholesterol, and the ganglioside GD1a, the virus resembled 
      more closely the fusogenic properties that were seen with erythrocyte target
      membranes. Upon decreasing the pH below 5.0, the viral fusion activity increased 
      dramatically. With acidic phospholipid vesicles, maximal activity was observed
      around pH 4.0, while with GD1a-containing zwitterionic vesicles the fusion
      activity continued to increase with decreasing pH down to values as low as
      3.0.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Complete sequence and structure of the gene for human adenosine deaminase.
PG  - 8234-44
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the human adenosine deaminase gene was determined. The
      gene was isolated in a series of overlapping lambda phage clones containing human
      germ line DNA. A total of 36,741 base pairs were sequenced, including 32,040 base
      pairs from the transcription initiation site to the polyadenylation site, 3935
      base pairs of 5'-flanking DNA, and 766 base pairs of 3'-flanking DNA. The gene
      contains 12 exons separated by 11 introns. The exons range in size from 62 to 325
      base pairs while the introns are 76-15 166 base pairs in size. The area sequenced
      contains 23 copies of Alu repetitive DNA and a single copy of an "O" family
      repeat. All but one of these repeat sequences are located in the first three
      introns or the 5'-flanking region. The apparent promoter region of the gene lacks
      the "TATA" and "CAAT" sequences often found in eucaryotic promoters and is
      extremely G/C rich. Contained within this region are areas homologous to other
      G/C-rich promoters, including six decanucleotide sequences that are highly
      homologous to sequences identified as functional binding sites for transcription 
      factor Sp1.

TI  - Carbon-13 and deuterium isotope effects on oxalacetate decarboxylation by
      pyruvate carboxylase.
PG  - 8197-205
AB  - Deuterium and 13C isotope effects for the enzymic decarboxylation of oxalacetate 
      showed that both deuterium- and 13C-sensitive steps in the reaction are partially
      rate limiting. A normal alpha-secondary effect of 1.2 per deuterium was
      calculated for the reaction in which pyruvate-d3 was the substrate, suggesting
      that the enolate of pyruvate was an intermediate in the reaction. The large
      normal alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effect of 1.7 when oxalacetate-d2 was
      the substrate suggests that the motions of the secondary hydrogens are coupled to
      that of the primary hydrogen during the protonation of the enolate of pyruvate.
      The reduction in the magnitude of the 13C isotope effect for the
      oxamate-dependent decarboxylation of oxalacetate from 1.0238 to 1.0155 when the
      reaction was performed in D2O (primary deuterum isotope effect = 2.1) clearly
      indicates that the transfer of the proton and carboxyl group between biotin and
      pyruvate does not occur via a single concerted reaction. Mechanisms in which
      biotin is activated to react with CO2 (prior to transfer of the proton on N-1) by
      bond formation between the sulfur and the ureido carbon, or in which the sequence
      of events is decarboxylation of oxalacetate, proton transfer from biotin to
      enolpyruvate, and carboxylation of enolbiotin, predict that the 13C isotope
      effect in D2O should be substantially lower than the observed value. A stepwise
      mechanism that does fit the data is one in which a proton is removed from biotin 
      by a sulfhydryl group on the enzyme prior to carboxyl transfer, as long as the
      sulfhydryl group has an abnormally low pK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Spatial relationship and conformational changes between the cardiac glycoside
      site and beta-subunit oligosaccharides in sodium plus potassium activated
      adenosinetriphosphatase.
PG  - 8133-41
AB  - (Na,K)-ATPase, the enzyme responsible for active transport of Na and K across the
      plasma membranes of animal cells, consists of a catalytic subunit (alpha) and a
      glycoprotein subunit (beta) with unknown function. We have determined the
      distance between fluorescent probes directed to specific sites on the alpha- and 
      beta-subunits and ligand-induced changes in the fluorescence of a probe
      specifically attached to the beta-subunit. The cardiac glycoside site on the
      alpha-subunit was labeled with anthroylouabain [Fortes, P. A. G. (1977)
      Biochemistry 16, 531-540]. The oligosaccharides on the beta-subunit were labeled 
      with lucifer yellow carbohydrazide [Lee, J. A., & Fortes, P. A. G. (1985)
      Biochemistry 24, 322-330]. Resonance energy transfer from anthroylouabain to
      lucifer yellow was measured by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence
      spectroscopy. The distance between these probes was determined from the
      efficiency of energy transfer. The average distance between anthroylouabain and
      lucifer yellow was 47 A and was independent of the number of acceptor molecules
      attached to the beta-subunit. The measured distance corresponds to the distance
      between the cardiac glycoside site and the center of the labeled oligosaccharides
      on the beta-subunit within one alpha beta dimer. The distance was the same (47 A)
      when anthroylouabain was bound with ATP or Pi as phosphorylating ligands but
      increased to 49 A in the presence of vanadate. The change in average distance
      provides quantitative evidence of a conformational difference between the
      complexes of cardiac glycosides with (Na,K)-ATPase induced by phosphorylating
      ligands or by vanadate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Molecular cloning of three distinct forms of the Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-subunit from
      rat brain.
PG  - 8125-32
AB  - Rat brain and kidney cDNA libraries were constructed and screened with a cDNA
      insert corresponding to the mRNA for the sheep kidney Na+,K+-ATPase catalytic
      subunit. The alpha-subunit cDNAs isolated from the kidney library were derived
      from a single class of messenger RNA, and the brain cDNAs were derived from three
      classes of messenger RNA. The most abundant brain cDNA, which spans 5.1
      kilobases, encodes the alpha(+) form of the enzyme. The second most abundant
      brain cDNA, which spans 3.65 kilobases, is identical with that of the kidney form
      and therefore encodes the alpha isoform. The third class of cDNA, which spans
      3.55 kilobases, was present at low abundance and encodes an isoform of the
      alpha-subunit, designated alpha III, which has not been identified previously.
      The complete nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence for each of the 
      brain and kidney cDNAs have been determined. In addition, we have identified a
      lysine-rich sequence that may function as a movable, ion-selective gate during
      cation binding and occlusion and have also identified several amino acid sequence
      variations that appear to explain some of the well-known species and tissue
      differences in cardiac glycoside sensitivity.

TI  - Effects of vanadate on water and electrolyte transport in rat jejunum.
PG  - 325-8
AB  - The effect of vanadate (orthovanadate, VO4-) on water and ion transport was
      studied in rat jejunum. Water transport was tested by single-pass perfusion in
      vivo and ion fluxes by the Ussing-chamber technique in vitro. The results suggest
      that vanadate has two actions on ion and water transport: At low concentrations
      (10(-4) M) it causes Cl-, Na+ and water secretion by stimulation of adenylate
      cyclase; At higher concentrations (10(-3) and 10(-2) M) it decreases net
      absorption of Na+ and Cl- by inhibition of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase.

TI  - The role of sphingomyelin synthetase and sphingomyelinase in
      1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced lipid alterations of rat colonic plasma membranes.
PG  - 309-12
AB  - Recently, our laboratory, utilizing the 1,2-dimethylhydrazine model of colonic
      adenocarcinoma, demonstrated alterations in the 'dynamic component' of fluidity
      in brush-border membranes prepared from distal colonocytes of rats administered
      this agent for 5, 10 and 15 weeks, i.e., before the development of colon cancer. 
      Furthermore, changes in the sphingomyelin content and
      sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine molar ratio of these membranes appeared, at
      least partially, to be responsible for these fluidity alterations. In an attempt 
      to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in these dimethylhydrazine-induced lipid
      changes, in the present studies the activities of sphingomyelin synthetase and
      magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase, enzymes involved in the synthesis
      and degradation of this phospholipid, respectively, were examined and compared in
      distal colonic brush-border membranes prepared from rats after 5, 10 or 15 weeks 
      administration of dimethylhydrazine or diluent. The results of these studies
      demonstrate that alterations in both these enzymatic activities can be detected
      after administration of dimethylhydrazine and appear to, at least in part, be
      responsible for the changes in membrane sphingomyelin composition noted
      previously. These results as well as a discussion of their possible serve as the 
      basis for the present report.

TI  - Membrane ordering effects of the anticancer agent VM-26.
PG  - 297-304
AB  - The effect of the anticancer agent VM-26 on acyl chain order of cellular and
      model membranes was examined by electron spin resonance techniques. The order
      parameter for the paramagnetic probe 5-doxyl stearate was increased when VM-26
      was incorporated into the bilayer of fluid-phase dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
      (DMPC) or gel-phase dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes at
      concentrations up to 4.8 mol%. The ordering effect of VM-26 in DMPC was greater
      than that of cholesterol on an equimolar basis. The less cytotoxic congener of
      VM-26, VP-16, was only one-third as active as VM-26 in its ordering effects on
      DMPC. Higher order parameters for 5-doxyl stearate were also noted in asolectin
      liposomes, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, and CCRF-CEM cells treated with VM-26. We
      conclude that VM-26 has significant membrane associated activity in addition to
      its previously recognized nuclear effects.

TI  - Calorimetric and fatty acid spin label study of subgel and interdigitated gel
      phases formed by asymmetric phosphatidylcholines.
PG  - 231-42
AB  - Several saturated asymmetric and symmetric phosphatidylcholines were studied by
      ESR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry in order to determine the 
      behavior of a fatty acid spin labeled near its terminal methyl, 16-doxylstearate,
      in the mixed interdigitated gel phase and the Lc subgel phase and other
      properties of these lipids. This spin label was motionally restricted in the
      mixed interdigitated gel phases of 18:10PC and 18:12PC. The motional restriction 
      was similar to that reported earlier for fully interdigitated phases. This spin
      label was motionally restricted almost to the same degree in 10:18PC suggesting
      that this asymmetric lipid may also form a mixed interdigitated bilayer. In
      contrast the spin label had more motion in the gel phase of 18:14PC than in
      symmetric forms of PC, consistent with conclusions from X-ray diffraction studies
      that this less asymmetric lipid does not form a mixed interdigitated phase. The
      spin label was partially frozen out of the Lc subgel phases of symmetric forms of
      PC and 18:14PC formed by storage at low temperature. The phase behavior of the
      other asymmetric lipids also depended on the sample history. Storage at low
      temperature caused 10:18PC and 18:12PC to go into ordered phases. The enthalpy of
      the transition of these ordered phases to the liquid-crystalline phase was
      2-2.4-times greater than that of the transition of the gel phase formed on
      cooling back from the liquid-crystalline phase. The temperature of this high
      enthalpy transition was 0.8 K below that of the lower enthalpy gel to
      liquid-crystalline phase transition for 18:12PC, but 4.6 K higher for 10:18PC.
      The spin label was frozen out of these ordered phases, as it was out of the Lc
      subgel phases, suggesting that 18:12PC and 10:18PC may also form an Lc phase.
      18:10PC was not observed to form an ordered phase although storage of the sample 
      at low temperatures did affect the temperature of its transition from the
      liquid-crystalline phase back to the gel phase upon cycling through its phase
      transition.

TI  - Rapid incorporation of the solubilized dihydropyridine receptor into phospholipid
      vesicles.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - We describe the rapid incorporation of the CHAPS solubilized dihydropyridine
      receptor into phospholipid vesicles. A series of sucrose gradient sedimentation
      experiments demonstrate that the (+)-[3H]PN200-110-labeled dihydropyridine
      receptor is associated with lipid vesicles following detergent removal by
      Extracti-gel chromatography. Solubilization of the receptor results in a loss of 
      (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding affinity relative to that observed in native membranes;
      the high affinity binding of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 can be restored upon
      reincorporation of the receptor into phospholipid vesicles. Similarly, the
      incorporation of the receptor restores its stability to incubation at 37 degrees 
      C relative to that of the detergent solubilized receptor, thereby mimicking the
      properties of the membrane bound form of the receptor. The dissociation rate of
      (+)-[3H]PN200-110 from the reconstituted receptor is shown to be allosterically
      regulated by verapamil and diltiazem, indicating that the binding sites for these
      calcium antagonists have been inserted along with the dihydropyridine receptor
      into phospholipid vesicles. The results presented in this report, thus
      demonstrate the successful reconstitution of the dihydropyridine receptor into
      phospholipid vesicles by a variety of criteria. The reconstitution method
      described here is rapid and efficient, and should now facilitate
      structure-function studies of this receptor and its interrelationships with other
      regulatory components of the voltage-sensitive calcium channel system.

PG  - 313-7
AB  - The potency of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, PN 200-110 was
      assessed in vitro against contractions induced by potassium (20-55 mM) and
      histamine (1-300 microM) in rabbit thoracic aorta, coronary, basilar, renal and
      central ear arteries. PN 200-110 was particularly effective against potassium
      responses in the coronary and basilar arteries (IC50 30 and 50 pM) and of little 
      effect against histamine responses in the renal artery and thoracic aorta (IC50
      greater than 1 microM). These results suggest that PN 200-110 has some
      preferential actions dependent on both the vascular bed and also the constrictor 
      used.

TI  - Specific interactions of the alkali light chain 1 in skeletal myosin heads probed
      by chemical cross-linking.
PG  - 8325-30
AB  - We have investigated the enzymatic properties of the 120K cross-linked
      heavy-chain-light-chain derivative formed upon reaction of chymotryptic myosin
      subfragment 1 (S-1) isoenzymes with the bis(imido esters) dimethyl
      3,3'-dithiobis(propionimidate) and dimethyl suberimidate. The formation of the
      120K product was accompanied for S-1(A1) but not for S-1(A2) by a loss of the
      actin-activated ATPase without alteration of the Ca2+-ATPase whereas the
      Mg2+-ATPase was increased 2-fold. Up to 70%, the inhibition of the acto-S-1(A1)
      ATPase activity was closely correlated with the extent of cross-linking of the A1
      light chain; this activity could be largely restored upon cleavage of the
      cross-link using the reversible cross-linker dimethyl
      3,3'-dithiobis(propionimidate). The covalent link affected the acto-S-1(A1)
      Mg2+-ATPase activity by reducing 3-fold the Vmax and increasing 2-fold the Kapp. 
      On reacting for the first time the hydrophobic, carboxyl group directed
      cross-linker N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) with the
      acto-S-1(A1 + A2) complex, we found that the N-terminal tail of the A1 light
      chain was cross-linked to actin to an extent much larger than observed earlier
      with the water-soluble 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide; like the 
      latter agent, EEDQ elicited the covalent union of the A1 subunit to the
      COOH-terminal part of actin. This cross-linker appears to be a valuable chemical 
      probe of the F-actin-A1 light-chain interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Measurements of fluorescence energy transfer have been performed to determine the
      distance between the lipid-water interface and the ATP-binding site in the (Ca2+ 
      + Mg2+)-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calculated distance between the
      donor, FITC bound to the protein (nucleotide binding-site marker), and the
      acceptor, rhodamine-5'-isothiocyanyldipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine
      (RITC-DPPE) incorporated in the membrane, was in the range of 34-42 A. In
      addition the distance between the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites and the
      lipid/water interface has been calculated by luminescence energy transfer from
      Tb3+ bound to the Ca2+ sites to RITC-DPPE included in the membrane, and it was
      approx. 10 A.

      modification by Ca2+.
PG  - 165-77
AB  - Media prepared with CDTA and low concentrations of Ca2+, as judged by the lack of
      Na+-dependent phosphorylation and ATPase activity of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase
      preparations are free of contaminant Mg2+. In these media, the Ca2+-ATPase from
      human red cell membranes is phosphorylated by ATP, and a low Ca2+-ATPase activity
      is present. In the absence of Mg2+ the rate of phosphorylation in the presence of
      1 microM Ca2+ is very low but it approaches the rate measured in Mg2+-containing 
      media if the concentration of Ca2+ is increased to 5 mM. The KCa for
      phosphorylation is 2 microM in the presence and 60 microM in the absence of Mg2+.
      Results are consistent with the idea that for catalysis of phosphorylation the
      Ca2+-ATPase needs Ca2+ at the transport site and Mg2+ at an activating site and
      that Ca2+ replaces Mg2+ at this site. Under conditions in which it increases the 
      rate of phosphorylation, Ca2+ is without effect on the Ca2+-ATPase activity in
      the absence of Mg2+ suggesting that to stimulate ATP hydrolysis Mg2+ accelerates 
      a reaction other than phosphorylation. Activation of the E1P----E2P reaction by
      Mg2+ is prevented by Ca2+ after but not before the synthesis of E1P from E1 and
      ATP, suggesting that Mg2+ stabilizes E1 in a state from which Mg2+ cannot be
      removed by Ca2+ and that Ca2+ stabilizes E1P in a state insensitive to Mg2+. The 
      response of the Ca2+-ATPase activity to Mg2+ concentration is biphasic,
      activation with a KMg = 88 microM is followed by inhibition with a Ki = 9.2 mM.
      Ca2+ at concentration up to 1 mM acts as a dead-end inhibitor of the activation
      by Mg2+, and Mg2+ at concentrations up to 0.5 mM acts as a dead-end inhibitor of 
      the effects of Ca2+ at the transport site of the Ca2+-ATPase.

      progesterone.
PG  - 323-6
AB  - Ipsapirone and gepirone, but not buspirone, facilitated lordosis in
      estrogen-treated rats, whereas all three drugs inhibited this behavior in rats
      treated with estrogen and progesterone. When administered at higher doses,
      ipsapirone, gepirone and buspirone inhibited lordosis in rats treated with either
      estrogen or estrogen and progesterone. These data are consistent with the
      proposal that 5-HT1A receptors mediate lordosis-inhibiting effects of 5-HT, and
      further suggest that some 5-HT1A agonists may facilitate lordosis by activity at 
      autoreceptors. Finally, these data show that progesterone may modulate activity
      at 5-HT1A receptors.

TI  - Antidepressant administration has a differential effect on rat brain alpha
      2-adrenoceptor sensitivity to agonists and antagonists.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the action of antidepressants on rat
      brain alpha 2-adrenoceptor function by examining their effect on the
      yohimbine-sensitive component of the cAMP response to adrenoceptor agonists.
      Using a prelabeling technique for measuring cAMP accumulation, it was found that 
      chronic (2 weeks) administration of antidepressants increased the potency of
      yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, to inhibit
      norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP accumulation in rat brain cerebral cortical
      slices. In contrast, antidepressant treatment decreased the ability of the
      alpha-adrenoceptor agonist 6-fluoronorepinephrine to augment
      isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The results suggest that
      antidepressants alter rat brain alpha 2-adrenergic function by shifting the
      receptor to antagonist-preferring state. Such an effect may contribute to the
      change in noradrenoceptor responsiveness that is characteristic of antidepressant
      administration.

TI  - Effects of the enantiomers of MDA, MDMA and related analogues on [3H]serotonin
      and [3H]dopamine release from superfused rat brain slices.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - The primary amines 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and
      1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-butanamine (BDB) were measured for efficacy in release
      of [3H]serotonin (5-HT) from rat hippocampal slices, and release of [3H]dopamine 
      (DA) from rat caudate nucleus slices. The N-methyl derivatives of MDA and BDB,
      MDMA and MBDB, respectively, and the optical antipodes of these four agents were 
      compared in this paradigm. All of the test compounds demonstrated a similar
      efficacy of [3H]5-HT release in the micromolar concentration range. No
      significant stereoselectivity was seen in measurements of 5-HT release. However, 
      striking differences were found between the test compounds when [3H]DA release
      was studied. N-methylation of racemic MDA resulted in a decreased ability to
      release DA, while side chain extension from alpha-methyl to alpha-ethyl
      completely abolished this activity. Stereoselectivity for the S-(+)-isomers of
      MDA and MDMA was also demonstrated in the DA release studies. Correlation of
      these biochemical findings with human subjective reports indicates that serotonin
      release may play a more important role in the mechanism of action than does
      dopamine release.

PG  - 259-62
AB  - A new non-benzodiazepine compound proposed as a non-sedating anxiolytic was
      tested in the mouse exploratory model of anxiety. CGS 9896 significantly
      increased the number of light dark transitions at doses beginning at 7.5 mg/kg
      i.p. Analysis of general locomotor activity at these doses revealed no change in 
      spontaneous motor activity in a photocell equipped activity monitor. Pretreatment
      with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro15-1788, 10 mg/kg i.p., blocked
      the increase in light dark transitions produced by CGS 9896. These data support
      the interpretation that CGS 9896 acts as an anxiolytic through the benzodiazepine
      receptor, and appears to have no sedating properties within the anxiolytic dose
      range.

PG  - 197-205
AB  - Segments of rabbit lateral saphenous vein prelabelled with [3H]noradrenaline were
      perfused and superfused with physiological salt solution. Tritium overflow evoked
      by transmural nerve stimulation (3 Hz for 2 min) was abolished by tetrodotoxin (1
      microM). The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14,304 inhibited
      stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 
      of 71 nM. In contrast, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist B-HT 933 had no effect on
      3H-overflow in concentrations up to 10 microM. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor
      antagonists idazoxan and SKF 86466, as well as the non-selective alpha-antagonist
      phentolamine, facilitated the nerve stimulation evoked 3H-overflow, with an order
      of potency of idazoxan greater than or equal to phentolamine greater than SK&F
      86466. Prazosin (100 nM) had little effect on 3H-overflow. These findings suggest
      that stimulation-evoked neurotransmitter release is modulated via prejunctional
      alpha 2-adrenoceptors.

TI  - Comparative beta-blocking activities and electrophysiologic actions of racemic
      sotalol and its optical isomers in anesthetized dogs.
PG  - 123-35
AB  - The relative activities of d-, 1- and racemic-sotalol were studied in two series 
      of anesthetized dogs. Estimates of relative beta-adrenergic blocking potency were
      based upon the ability of the compounds to antagonize isoproterenol-elicited
      increases in heart rate and decreases in diastolic blood pressure. On a molar
      basis, d-sotalol displayed 1/12-1/14th and 1-sotalol 1.6-3.2 X the potency of the
      racemic parent drug as beta-antagonists. His bundle electrogram (HBE)
      measurements, surface ECG recordings and the extra stimulus technique at a
      constant pacing cycle length were utilized to assess the comparative effects of
      sotalol and its optical isomers on cardiac conduction and refractoriness. At i.v.
      doses spanning equiactive beta-blocking levels, d- (1, 4, 16 mg X kg-1), 1-
      (0.25, 1, 4 mg X kg-1) or dl-sotalol (0.5, 2, 8 mg X kg-1) caused dose-dependent 
      increases in ventricular and, to an even greater extent, atrial refractoriness.
      The mean plasma drug concentrations (Cp) attained with these doses were:
      d-sotalol 9.5, 44 and 267 nmol X l-1; 1-sotalol 9.6, 16 and 66 nmol X l-1; and
      dl-sotalol 5.4, 23 and 106 nmol X l-1. The relative mg potency from greatest to
      least was 1-sotalol greater than dl-sotalol greater than d-sotalol in prolonging 
      the ventricular effective refractory period (V-ERP); the mean increases above
      control at the highest dose of each were 58 +/- 4, 47 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 3 ms,
      respectively. At those same dose levels, atrial refractoriness (A-ERP) was
      maximally elevated 49 +/- 11, 82 +/- 5 and 104 +/- 10 ms by 1-, dl- and
      d-sotalol, respectively. These increases in refractoriness occurred without
      alterations in atrial, His-Purkinje or ventricular conduction velocity; however, 
      all three forms of sotalol significantly reduced AV nodal conduction. At the dose
      multiples studied, the effects on this variable (AH interval) were greatest
      following 1-sotalol (20-60 ms) or racemic sotalol (20-57 ms) and least following 
      the d-isomer (7-43 ms). The profile of effects observed with d-sotalol is that of
      an agent with Class III electrophysiologic effects and weak beta-adrenergic
      blocking properties.

TI  - TPP+ accumulation in rat brain synaptosomes as a probe for Na+ channels.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - Tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) accumulation in rat brain synaptosomes was measured
      in the presence of various stimuli. TPP+ accumulation was sensitive to an
      increase of extracellular K+ or to the presence of Na+ channel neurotoxins.
      Examination of the effects of drugs with different physico-chemical properties on
      TPP+ accumulation showed that there was no effect under low and high K+
      conditions; pimozide, flunarizine and buterizine were active in the presence of
      veratridine or scorpion venom. These results were compared to data obtained for
      the specific binding of [3H]BTX-B, a selective marker for the Na+ channel. It can
      be concluded that certain drugs, although active on [3H]BTX-B binding, are not
      necessarily identified when TPP+ is used as probe.

TI  - Chronic imipramine administration reduces apomorphine inhibitory effects.
PG  - 263-7
AB  - Changes in activity of dopaminergic and serotonergic systems were assessed after 
      acute and chronic (14 days) imipramine (10 mg/kg) administration in mice. For
      this purpose, biochemical and behavioural tests were performed at different
      intervals of time after withdrawal of treatment. Brain levels of
      5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, homovanillic acid and
      3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were assayed by a fluorometric method. Locomotion 
      and stationary behaviour were investigated in the open-field test. The results of
      the experiments suggest that chronic imipramine reduces the inhibitory effects of
      apomorphine upon the dopaminergic system.

TI  - Functional characterization of junctional terminal cisternae from mammalian fast 
      skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum.
PG  - 8315-24
AB  - Junctional terminal cisternae are a recently isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum
      fraction containing two types of membranes, the junctional face membrane with
      morphologically intact "feet" structures and the calcium pump membrane [Saito,
      A., Seiler, S., Chu, A., & Fleischer, S. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 875-885]. In
      this study, the Ca2+ fluxes of junctional terminal cisternae are characterized
      and compared with three other well-defined fractions derived from the
      sarcotubular system of fast-twitch skeletal muscle, including light and heavy
      sarcoplasmic reticulum, corresponding to longitudinal and terminal cisternae
      regions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and isolated triads. Functionally,
      junctional terminal cisternae have low net energized Ca2+ transport measured in
      the presence or absence of a Ca2+-trapping anion, as compared to light and heavy 
      sarcoplasmic reticulum and triads. Ca2+ transport and Ca2+ pumping efficiency can
      be restored to values similar to those of light sarcoplasmic reticulum with
      ruthenium red or high [Mg2+]. In contrast to junctional terminal cisternae, heavy
      sarcoplasmic reticulum and triads have higher Ca2+ transport and are stimulated
      less by ruthenium red. Heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum appears to be derived from
      the nonjunctional portion of the terminal cisternae. Our studies indicate that
      the decreased Ca2+ transport is referable to the enhanced permeability to Ca2+,
      reflecting the predominant localization of Ca2+ release channels in junctional
      terminal cisternae. This conclusion is based on the following observations: The
      Ca2+, -Mg2+ -dependent ATPase activity of junctional terminal cisternae in the
      presence of a Ca2+ ionophore is comparable to that of light sarcoplasmic
      reticulum when normalized for the calcium pump protein content; i.e., the
      enhanced Ca2+ transport cannot be explained by a faster turnover of the pump.
      Ruthenium red or elevated [Mg2+] enhances energized Ca2+ transport and Ca2+
      pumping efficiency in junctional terminal cisternae so that values approaching
      those of light sarcoplasmic reticulum are obtained. Rapid Ca2+ efflux in
      junctional terminal cisternae can be directly measured and is blocked by
      ruthenium red or high [Mg2+]. Ryanodine at pharmacologically significant
      concentrations blocks the ruthenium red stimulation of Ca2+ loading. Ryanodine
      binding in junctional terminal cisternae, which appears to titrate Ca2+ release
      channels, is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of the calcium
      pump protein. By contrast, light sarcoplasmic reticulum has a high Ca2+ loading
      rate and slow Ca2+ efflux that are not modulated by ruthenium red, ryanodine, or 
      Mg2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Isolated spherical rat hepatocytes attached to collagen-coated cover slips
      generate a mean membrane potential (Em) of -78 +/- 9 mV as measured with
      high-resistance microelectrodes. The recordings were biphasic and were stable for
      upto 20 minutes. The correlation between external potassium concentration and Em 
      was not linear. Several potassium-channel blockers did not effect the membrane
      potential. Addition of ouabain added to the incubation solution slowly
      depolarized the cells. The results indicate a high potassium permeability of the 
      isolated spherical hepatocytes attached to collagen.

TI  - Peptides increase anion conductance of canine trachea: an effect on tight
      junctions.
PG  - 305-8
AB  - The ionic basis for the rapid reduction in potential difference (dip) produced on
      luminal addition of substance P and related peptides was analysed by altering the
      electromotive force and chemical gradients across the isolated, canine tracheal
      epithelium. The dip could be exaggerated, minimised or reversed by increasing,
      decreasing or reversing the basal potential difference, and the intercept of the 
      line relating the two was close to zero when the Cl- compositions of the two
      bathing solutions were identical. Luminal Cl- replacement by a non-permeant anion
      (isethionate) attenuated the dip which was, however, exaggerated by a permeant
      anion (nitrate). Replacement of serosal Na+ or luminal HCO3- had no significant
      effect on the magnitude of the dip. The tachykinins exhibited cross-tachyphylaxis
      with each other, indicating a common receptor. Bradykinin, a structurally
      unrelated peptide, also produced dips upon luminal addition, but showed no
      cross-tachyphylaxis with the tachykinins. Again, a linear relation between basal 
      potential difference and the dip elicited by bradykinin was observed. Based on
      current awareness of the bioelectric properties of the canine tracheal
      epithelium, we suggest that these peptides modulate paracellular anion
      permeabilities.

TI  - Spontaneous vesicularization of myelin lipids is counteracted by myelin basic
      protein.
PG  - 282-8
AB  - Hand-vortexed dispersions of several lipids (cerebrosides, sulfatides, PC, PE, PS
      and sphingomyelin), mixed in the ratios found for these categories of lipids in
      myelin, exhibit 31P-NMR spectra which have contributions from both isotropic and 
      lamellar resonances. Investigation of this system by freeze-fracture electron
      microscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed that this lipid mixture has
      spontaneously formed small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (diam. approximately 400
      A) and large highly convoluted unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (diam. approximately
      1000 A), the latter possibly resulting from aggregation and fusion of the SUV
      structures. This vesicularization of the myelin lipids was reversed by the
      addition of myelin basic protein: only large multilamellar aggregates were formed
      in the presence of protein, as shown by all three experimental methods. Although 
      no rigorous physical-chemical explanation for these phenomena is yet available,
      the possibility is suggested that the high concentration of cerebrosides and/or
      phosphatidylethanolamine in this particular mixture of myelin lipids play pivotal
      roles in the formation of these unusual vesicles. Spontaneous vesicularization of
      myelin lipids is discussed as a potential pathway toward destabilization of the
      myelin sheath.

TI  - Cholesterol depletion affects the Ca2+ influx but not the Ca2+ pump in human
      erythrocytes.
PG  - 253-63
AB  - Control and cholesterol-depleted human erythrocytes were loaded with permeant
      Ca2+ chelators (Benz2-AM or Quin2-AM) in order to increase their exchangeable
      Ca2+ pool and to measure both Ca2+ fluxes and [Ca]i (free cytoplasmic calcium
      concentration). The fluxes were independent of the concentration and of the
      nature of the intracellular chelator. The ATP content was not decreased by more
      than 50% under our experimental conditions. Cholesterol depletion (up to 28%)
      induced a decrease in both Ca2+ fluxes and [Ca]i which was proportional to the
      extent of the depletion. It is shown that cholesterol depletion primarily altered
      the properties of the system responsible for Ca2+ entry causing a diminution of
      the [Ca]i. This, in turn, induced a diminution of the activity of the Ca2+ pump
      without affecting the properties of this pump.
