BTI - Environmental Tobacco Smoke: Measuring Exposures and Assessing Health Effects
AB  - This comprehensive book examines the recent research investigating the
      characteristics and composition of different types of environmental tobacco smoke
      (ETS) and discusses possible health effects of ETS. The volume presents an
      overview of methods used to determine exposures to environmental smoke and
      reviews both chronic and acute health effects. Many recommendations are made for 
      areas of further research, including the differences between smokers and
      nonsmokers in absorbing, metabolizing, and excreting the components of ETS, and
      the possible effects of ETS exposure during childhood and fetal life.

BTI - The Medical Implications of Nuclear War
AB  - Written by world-renowned scientists, this volume portrays the possible direct
      and indirect devastation of human health from a nuclear attack. The most
      comprehensive work yet produced on this subject, The Medical Implications of
      Nuclear War includes an overview of the potential environmental and physical
      effects of nuclear bombardment, describes the problems of choosing who among the 
      injured would get the scarce medical care available, addresses the nuclear arms
      race from a psychosocial perspective, and reviews the medical needs--in contrast 
      to the medical resources likely to be available--after a nuclear attack. "It
      should serve as the definitive statement on the consequences of nuclear
      war."--Arms Control Today

      Importance in Developing Countries
AB  - Common diseases cost the developing world an enormous amount in terms of human
      life, health, and productivity, as well as lost economic potential. New and
      effective vaccines could not only improve the quality of life for millions of
      residents in developing countries, they could also contribute substantially to
      further economic development. Using data from the World Health Organization and
      other international agencies, this book analyzes disease burdens, pathogen
      descriptions, geographic distribution of diseases, probable vaccine target
      populations, alternative control measures and treatments, and future prospects
      for vaccine development. New Vaccine Development provides valuable insight into
      immunological and international health policy priorities.

BTI - The Airliner Cabin Environment: Air Quality and Safety
AB  - Each year Americans take more than 300 million plane trips staffed by a total of 
      some 70,000 flight attendants. The health and safety of these individuals are the
      focus of this volume from the Committee on Airliner Cabin Air Quality. The book
      examines such topics as cabin air quality, the health effects of reduced pressure
      and cosmic radiation, emergency procedures, regulations established by U.S. and
      foreign agencies, records on airline maintenance and operation procedures, and
      medical statistics on air travel. Numerous recommendations are presented,
      including a ban on smoking on all domestic commercial flights to lessen
      discomfort to passengers and crew, to eliminate the possibility of fire caused by
      cigarettes, and to bring the cabin air quality into line with established
      standards for other closed environments.

      Robert Pear of The New York Times. This major study by the Institute of Medicine 
      examines virtually all aspects of for-profit health care in the United States,
      including the quality and availability of health care, the cost of medical care, 
      access to financial capital, implications for education and research, and the
      fiduciary role of the physician. In addition to the report, the book contains 15 
      papers by experts in the field of for-profit health care covering a broad range
      of topics--from trends in the growth of major investor-owned hospital companies
      to the ethical issues in for-profit health care. "The report makes a lasting
      contribution to the health policy literature."--Journal of Health Politics,

      scientific, social, and commercial questions inherent in hazards management. Part
      I discusses how best to regulate hazards arising from chronic, low-level
      exposures and from low-probability events when science is unable to assign causes
      or estimate consequences of such hazards; Part II examines fairness in the
      distribution of risks and benefits of potentially hazardous technologies; and
      Part III presents practical lessons and cautions about managing hazardous
      technologies. Together, the three sections put hazard management into
      perspective, providing a broad spectrum of views and information.

BTI - Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes
AB  - As more people live longer, the need for quality long-term care for the elderly
      will increase dramatically. This volume examines the current system of nursing
      home regulations, and proposes an overhaul to better provide for those confined
      to such facilities. It determines the need for regulations, and concludes that
      the present regulatory system is inadequate, stating that what is needed is not
      more regulation, but better regulation. This long-anticipated study provides a
      wealth of useful background information, in-depth study, and discussion for
      nursing home administrators, students, and teachers in the health care field;
      professionals involved in caring for the elderly; and geriatric specialists.

      dietary surveys, and an analysis of the basis of dietary evaluation and its
      relationship to recommended dietary allowances. A discussion of how usual dietary
      intake may be estimated from survey data, a recommended approach to dietary
      analysis, and an application of the analysis method is presented. Further, an
      examination of the impact of technical errors, the results of confidence interval

      dietary habits, examines the impact of fast-food proliferation and the changing
      role of women as it affects dietary behavior, and analyzes the nutritional
      consequences of national dietary trends. Speakers focused on what major food
      consumption surveys and large-scale studies have demonstrated, including factors 
      that shape eating patterns, eating trends such as snacking and food variety,
      nutrition policy and its effects on diet, and the overall nutritional status of
      the U.S. population.

      the various forms of unpaid productive work and how they affect the health and
      well-being of the volunteer, and the recruitment of elderly volunteers that is
      done by various organizations. For policymakers, economists, sociologists,

BTI - Electronic Travel AIDS: New Directions for Research
AB  - In this report we identify the most promising directions for research on the
      mobility problems of visually impaired and blind people. We show that information
      is not generally available on the number of people who might benefit from
      electronic travel aids. Although we have made some guesses about the prevalence
      of visual impairment and blindness in the United States, we believe them to be
      underestimates of the true rates. Better information is needed about this
      population and should be collected with certain variables in mind: age, onset,
      degree of impairment, and certain social factors such as income level.
      Information is also not available on the use of electronic travel aids. More
      extensive follow-up studies are needed to determine the usefulness and success of
      particular devices.

PG  - 95-115
AB  - The increase in both the numbers of physician office laboratories (POLs) and the 
      range of tests they offer may have significant impact on hospital laboratories.
      Their profitability already weakened by prospective payment systems, hospital
      laboratories face a serious competitor in physicians' offices. Concerns about the
      quality of testing performed in POLs do not seem to be impeding their growth, but
      are stimulating various regulatory or legislative proposals, which would remove
      some of their economic incentives. Physicians will always need referral
      laboratories, and hospitals will need to cultivate this market by improving
      services to physicians. One such service--consultation by hospitals' clinical
      laboratory staffs--has the added feature of helping to improve the quality of
      POLs.

TI  - Outcomes of surgery in the Medicare aged population: rehospitalization after
      surgery.
PG  - 23-34
AB  - Using 1979 and 1980 data, rehospitalization rates following eight common surgical
      procedures are examined for aged Medicare beneficiaries. Rehospitalization rates 
      within 30 days after discharge from the surgical stay varied considerably among
      procedures and were higher for older beneficiaries. Patients residing in the
      Northeast had the lowest rates of rehospitalization, although their
      rehospitalizations tended to be lengthier than those elsewhere. Rehospitalization
      rates were also tracked for 9 months following discharge from the surgical stay. 
      For all procedures, rehospitalization rates decreased during the 9 months after
      discharge, but they remained above the prevailing hospitalization rate for the
      Medicare aged population for the entire 9 months. Principal diagnoses associated 
      with rehospitalizations within 30 days were often related to the body system on
      which surgery was initially performed, suggesting that many rehospitalizations
      are for continuing problems related to the initial condition that necessitated
      surgery. Rehospitalization rates presented in this article will serve as baseline
      data for monitoring trends under medicare's prospective payment system for
      hospitals.

TI  - An approach to the assessment of learning needs for physician-managers.
PG  - 629-43
AB  - In recent years physicians have become increasingly involved in the
      decision-making and policy-making processes in hospitals and other health service
      organizations. Consequently, there is a growing awareness of the need for
      specialized education programs for physicians who have managerial
      responsibilities. While education programs in management for physicians have been
      available in Britain and the United States for a number of years, relatively few 
      programs have existed in Canada. Typically, physicians who have assumed
      administrative positions either within the medical staff organization or within
      the hospital's management structure have received no formal training in
      management. This article examines reasons for the increased demand for management
      education for physicians in Canada, specific needs of physicians in the area of
      management education, and the assessment of needs for management education
      programs.

AB  - Although there is a growing surplus of physicians in the United States,
      predictions are that the use of physician assistants (PAs) in group practice will
      continue to grow during this decade. Patient accessibility is the most important 
      reason. Based on a recent survey, findings concerning the current and future
      utilization of PAs in group practice are presented.

TI  - Fund raising from a volunteer's perspective.
PG  - 13-4
AB  - Dick Rathgeber recently volunteered to lead a major fund raising drive for the
      Salvation Army in Austin, Texas. Of the $3.6 million effort, Rathgeber personally
      solicited $2.2 million, receiving pledges from nearly 80 percent of the calls he 
      made. Although he has been a volunteer fund raiser for only four years, he
      obviously is successful at it. "It's a noble calling," says Rathgeber. "I've been
      richly blessed in my life, and this is my way of giving some of it back." The
      following article was adapted from a speech Rathgeber gave to attendees of NAHD's
      Region 5 Conference in San Antonio this past spring by Pat Korbus, writer for
      Seton Medical Center in Austin, Texas.

TI  - Economic considerations for dispensing pharmacists: the impact of price-quality
      evaluations on brand categorization.
PG  - 41-60
AB  - This paper examines consumer brand categorization in view of price-quality
      evaluations. In particular it examines the relationship of the Brisoux and
      Laroche (1980) brand categorization process and the Bliemel (1984)
      conceptualization of consumers' price-quality evaluations, in a pharmaceutical
      marketing context. The findings suggest that: the Brisoux-Laroche
      conceptualization is supported in a pharmaceutical/industrial marketing scenario;
      and, the pharmacists' categorization of brands (i.e., into the evoked, hold,
      foggy, and reject sets) can be partially explained as an outcome of a
      price-quality evaluation process.

      Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, before the Committee
      on Finance, U.S. Senate, on June 3, 1986. He discusses concerns about quality of 
      care under the Medicare program and his commitment to ensuring that every
      Medicare patient receives high quality, medically necessary care. He delineates
      the mechanisms and activities that the Health Care Financing Administration uses 
      to assure quality, new methods that are being explored, and the research program 
      emphasis on the impact of the prospective payment system on quality as well as
      possible refinements to the system.

AB  - Strong interest by Congress in a Medicare prospective payment system for skilled 
      nursing facilities (SNF's) resulted in a major study by the Health Care Financing
      Administration on the Medicare SNF benefit. This article highlights findings from
      that study, which addressed the following: the Medicare SNF benefit, utilization 
      and expenditures, the Medicare SNF industry, problems with the current Medicare
      SNF reimbursement system, efforts to develop a Medicare SNF case-mix measure, and
      case-mix differences between hospital-based and freestanding SNF's. In addition, 
      we discuss the implications of the study findings for the design of a Medicare
      SNF prospective payment system (PPS).

TI  - The economics of information exchange: Medicaid in Wisconsin.
PG  - 65-78
AB  - In Medicaid, as in all third-party insurance, there are significant costs for
      information exchange between providers of services and the State (or other
      insurer), which reimburses those providers. On the basis of a study of Medicaid
      in Wisconsin, this article indicates that appreciable costs are incurred owing to
      deficiencies in information exchange between these parties. It is proposed that
      the costs of automated interventions, which could improve information exchange,
      be compared with the existing costs of the present system of information
      exchange.

TI  - Should children's hospitals have special consideration in reimbursement policy?
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Children's hospitals were excluded indefinitely from the prospective payment
      system until a methodology for their reimbursement could be developed. Special
      consideration in reimbursement policy could be made for children's hospitals if
      their patients were generally more resource intensive than the pediatric patients
      of other hospitals. The resource intensity of patients in children's hospitals
      was compared with pediatric patients in other hospital groups. The results
      indicate that the patient population of children's hospitals is similar to the
      pediatric patient population of university hospitals and considerably different
      from the pediatric patient populations of the urban and rural hospitals.

TI  - Factors affecting appropriateness of hospital use in Massachusetts.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - To determine the extent of inappropriate hospital use, and to investigate factors
      related to variations in appropriateness, 8,031 hospital records of patients
      discharged from 41 hospitals in 3 Massachusetts professional standards review
      organization (PSRO) areas were reviewed in 1973 and 1978. The Appropriateness
      Evaluation Protocol (AEP) was used for the reviews and logistic regression
      analysis was used to analyze factors associated with inappropriate use. Based on 
      the results, the authors conclude that utilization review should focus on: longer
      stays among surgical patients and shorter stays among medical patients;
      (projected) last third of the stay; and on diagnoses or diagnosis-related groups 
      in which there is less clinical consensus on treatment method. For maximum
      effectiveness, utilization review must include incentives beyond simple
      monitoring (e.g., financial incentives).

TI  - Case-mix reimbursement for nursing home services: simulation approach.
PG  - 35-45
AB  - Nursing home reimbursement based on case mix is a matter of growing interest.
      Several States either use or are considering this reimbursement method. In this
      article, we present a method for evaluating key outcomes of such a change for
      Connecticut nursing homes. A simulation model is used to replicate payments under
      the case-mix systems used in Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia. The findings
      indicate that, compared with the system presently used in Connecticut, these
      systems would better relate dollar payments to measure patient need, and
      for-profit homes would benefit relative to nonprofit homes. The Ohio methodology 
      would impose the most additional costs, the West Virginia system would actually
      be somewhat less expensive in terms of direct patient care payments.

TI  - National health expenditures, 1985.
PG  - 1-21
AB  - Slower price inflation in 1985 translated into slower growth of national health
      expenditures, but underlying growth in the use of goods and services continued
      along historic trends. Coupled with somewhat sluggish growth of the gross
      national product, this adherence to trends pushed the share of our Nation's
      output accounted for by health spending to 10.7 percent. Some aspects of health
      spending changed: falling use of hospital services was offset by rising hospital 
      profits and increased use of other health care services. Other aspects remained
      the same: both the public sector and the private sector continued efforts to
      contain costs, efforts that have affected and will continue to affect not only
      the providers of care but the users of care as well.

PG  - 125-39
AB  - This article has examined the application of a marketing and community planning
      process to the development of a regional, complete patient transportation system.
      The model is designed to interface with a region whose existing Emergency Medical
      Service System is operating at the advanced Life Support (usually paramedic)
      level. It is suitable for regions whose existing ambulance (ground and air)
      services are in need of improvement and/or coordination, and specifically
      utilizes the concept of ownership and management by a hospital consortium. The
      model, as described, is sufficiently flexible to be usable in a variety of local 
      and regional environments, where changes in the patient transportation system can
      enhance the quality and operations of emergency medical services.

TI  - The health compliance model.
PG  - 135-52
AB  - Another model for integrating a wide diversity of evidence related to compliance 
      is proposed, termed the Health Compliance (HC) model. The HC model incorporates
      situational-antecedent, consequence, and organismic factors, including cognitive 
      processes, as they relate functionally to compliance behaviors. A selective
      review of the compliance literature suggests the scope and organizational
      possibilities of the model.

TI  - Dr. Copeland on cardiac transplantation. Interview by Monica Kalker.
PG  - 32-6
AB  - The following interview is an exchange between Jack Copeland, M.D., Robert Emery,
      M.D., and Anne Nicholson, R.N., members of the heart transplant team at the
      University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona. Dr. Copeland currently
      is the chief cardiac surgeon as well as professor and chief of Cardiovascular and
      Thoracic Surgery. Dr. Emery is an associate professor in the division of
      cardiothoracic surgery. Ms. Nicholson is a cardiac transplant coordinator for the
      Center. The University of Arizona's Heart Transplant program has proven itself in
      terms of actuarial survival, innovative approaches to recipients, surgical
      techniques, and with the maintenance of relatively short hospital stays and low
      costs to the patient.

TI  - Unstructured play in hospital settings: an internal locus of control rationale.
PG  - 101-7
AB  - Play reveals how well or poorly children are coping with stresses.
      Simultaneously, play can influence the balance between affect and cognition as
      well as between children and their environments. Play is a process by which
      children can control contingencies and affect outcomes. It is unstructured play
      that particularly permits children to control events, ideas, and relationships.
      This article provides a locus of control rationale for unstructured play in
      hospital settings and presents implications for adults' roles in young children's
      play that enhance internal perception of control.

      future-minded medical group practices. One rapidly growing phenomenon is
      outpatient surgery. Can development of a freestanding ambulatory surgery center
      be a useful and economically prudent venture for medical groups? Documented here 
      is the case study of Rancho Surgical Plaza, an outpatient surgery center
      developed by Southwest Medical Associates in Las Vegas, Nevada.

AB  - A unique problem confronted the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle,
      Washington. How should it position itself as an organization to provide health
      care to the Pacific Basin countries--namely, China, Japan, Korea, and others? The
      problem originated with the increased emphasis in the US and especially the
      Pacific Northwest on trade with China, a growing sense of competition in the area
      of international medicine, and the large number of foreign businesses that have
      expanded their operations to the area. Also, the medical center felt the need to 
      diversify its services and differentiate itself from the local competition. The
      various alternatives and corrective measures taken are outlined, as well as an
      explanation of the results.

TI  - Synergy and healing: a perspective on Western health care.
PG  - 109-36
AB  - There is a crisis in health care resulting from the scarcity of resources and the
      inequitable distribution of those resources toward those most able to pay. Two
      paradigms for the generation and distribution of resources are discussed. The
      scarcity paradigm, in which individuals must compete for scarce resources,
      dominates Western care and expresses and supports that crisis. The synergy
      paradigm, in which individuals share resources which are renewable and expanding,
      is rare in the West but could help alleviate that crisis. Three case studies of
      synergy in Western health care are presented, illustrating the nature and
      functioning of "synergistic community". Dilemmas remaining in the introduction
      and maintenance of synergy within Western care are discussed.

      students.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - Much of the work in the area of consumer satisfaction/dissatisfaction has
      revolved around dissatisfaction and complaining behavior (Anderson, Gunter,
      Altimus and Pittman, 1973). This is indeed an interesting phenomenon when one
      notes that a relatively small percentage (generally less than one-third) of
      consumers formally complain when dissatisfied (Trawick and Swan, 1979). Many of
      the numerous products and services on today's market prove to be unsatisfactory
      to consumers (Moore, Shuptrine and Thomas, 1979). Interest in this particular
      field of complaint behavior has resulted in a number of studies focusing on
      differences between complainers and noncomplainers, effects of purchase
      expectations being confirmed or denied, and descriptions of consumer problem
      areas (Bearden, Teel and Crockett, 1980).

      highest in attribute descriptions. Hospital stay in the previous eight years was 
      associated with small differences in ranking by the respondents.

TI  - Characteristics of borderline personality disorder admissions to private
      psychiatric hospitals.
PG  - 195-9
AB  - Inpatients diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) by DSM-III
      criteria who were admitted to 11 Central Neuropsychiatric Hospital Association
      (CNPHA) hospitals in 1982 and 1983 are described in terms of 28 clinical-history 
      and demographic characteristics. This study statistically compared 181 BPD
      inpatients to 1,121 non-BPD inpatients admitted to the same hospitals during the 
      same period as part of the broader CNPHA prospective outcome study. These BPD
      inpatients were also compared to other BPD samples described in the literature.
      The 1982-83 CNPHA BPD inpatients exhibited clinical and demographic
      characteristics significantly different from their non-BPD counterparts. These
      BPD inpatients, mostly female, may have had particularly difficult living
      situations, had extensive treatment histories that began early, were frequently
      self-destructive, and had a distinctive medication pattern, among other
      characteristics. Comparison to other BPD samples in the literature showed
      similarities, supporting the generalizability of the CNPHA prospective outcome
      study.

TI  - Profile of 1,300 admissions to Central Neuropsychiatric Hospital Association
      Collaborative Research Hospitals.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - A collaborative effort to describe patients at admission led to the development
      of the Central Data Set, a 32-item profile of demographic and clinical variables 
      which was used to sample 1,302 admissions across 10 hospitals in 1982. Weighted
      estimates indicated that this group of adult patients admitted to CNPHA-member
      hospitals were younger than those admitted to other private psychiatric
      hospitals, almost half had more than one previous psychiatric hospitalization,
      about one-fourth had made a previous suicide attempt, and two-thirds had engaged 
      in psychotherapy or counseling prior to his admission. Most common diagnoses at
      admission were major affective disorders (36%), personality disorders (36%),
      substance abuse (30%), schizophrenic disorders (13%), and depressive neuroses
      (13%).

TI  - Patient and hospital treatment clusters.
PG  - 181-9
AB  - Patient admission data and treatment data collected for 536 cases from 11
      collaborating private psychiatric hospitals were subjected to cluster analysis.
      From the patient admission data, four large clusters and three small clusters
      emerged. Two very large and general clusters and four very small clusters were
      obtained from the treatment data. Both sets of clusters were cross-classified
      against diagnosis, length of hospital stay, and attainment of therapeutic goals. 
      There were several significant but small relationships between clusters and these
      criteria. There was little overlap between diagnosis and the patient data or
      treatment data clusters. Length of stay related only to the treatment clusters
      which included a number of variables measuring different treatment amounts. The
      method seems potentially useful because it groups individuals along dimensions of
      interest, but further effort must be spent on more specific treatment
      descriptions and better outcome variables.

AB  - While it is desirable to conduct clinical research across different institutions 
      using the richness and complexity of daily clinical data from the hospital chart,
      it is possible only if reliable information can be obtained. This report
      represents the efforts made by eight collaborating private psychiatric hospitals 
      to devise two instruments to provide reliable rating and notation of clinical
      information found in the medical record. Such information will spawn future
      studies of applied clinical research.

TI  - BASIS: the development of a self-report measure for psychiatric inpatient
      evaluation.
PG  - 165-71
AB  - Reliable and valid instruments are vital to assess the course and outcome of
      psychiatric disorders. This paper describes the development of BASIS (Behaviour
      and Symptom Identification Scale), a self-report assessment instrument for
      assessing functioning of psychiatric inpatients, and provides validating data for
      its use in a psychiatric hospital. The instrument was administered to 677 newly
      admitted patients. For approximately half of the sample, patients' nearest
      relatives provided parallel ratings of the patient. Interviews were repeated
      three to six weeks after admission and again six months after discharge.
      Test-retest reliability was found to be comparable to that for a standardized
      symptom checklist (SCL-90). Analyses of validity pointed to the instrument's
      capability in discriminating diagnostic groups, item correlations with similar
      symptom dimensions on other assessment measures, and correlations with relative's
      assessments of patients on the same measure. In conclusion, BASIS appears to be a
      promising tool for psychiatric inpatient evaluation studies.

TI  - Medical practice where HMOs dominate: the perspective of physicians in
      Minneapolis-St. Paul.
PG  - 81-9
AB  - Physicians in the Twin Cities are part of a progressive medical community which
      has traditionally participated in and often provided leadership for innovation
      and change in healthcare delivery. Recently, the health maintenance organizations
      (HMOs) and other managed care systems in which they have participated and even
      founded have grown to dominate the medical care of Minneapolis-St. Paul with 50% 
      of the population enrolled. Although in this healthy, homogeneous, and
      middle-class community physicians say they are satisfied that the quality of
      healthcare for patients still continues to be good, the lives of
      physicians--their mode of practice and their interactions with patients,
      colleagues, and hospitals--have changed fundamentally. Whether physicians
      practice in staff or group HMOs or continue to practice in their own offices,
      they say they are no longer "in control"; the plans "call the tune".

AB  - The National Health Service continues to assimilate its restructuring under the
      Griffiths Plan of central administration, while retaining its basic premise of
      the individual's right to medical services. This transition has generated unease 
      and resistance among healthcare practitioners and professional organizations.
      Under the current structure, some professional responses, such as the method of
      delivery of nursing services, prove unfeasible in many hospital situations.

TI  - Women physicians: facts, fantasies, and prospects.
PG  - 130-4
AB  - The increasing numbers of women physicians will affect the practicing physician
      both directly and indirectly. Women physician practitioners have more female
      patients, spend more time with each patient, and perform more pap smears than
      their male counterparts. Although the data are sparse, few other differences have
      been found in the practices of male and female physicians. Because women
      physicians choose different specialties and are less productive in traditional
      terms than men, their increasing numbers will affect the perceived balances and
      imbalances in the specialties, thus shifting the competition among physicians.
      Women physicians are also more likely to choose organized practice settings where
      they are salaried. This paper explores the available data and speculates on the
      long-term implications of more women in the medical profession.

TI  - Physician gets marketing assistance from progressive hospital.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - Increasing a physician's office volume is beneficial to the hospital where the
      physician practices. Hospital assistance in marketing the physician's services
      can therefore be rewarding to both parties and enhance physician allegiance to
      the hospital providing the support. A theoretical model for such marketing
      support is reviewed step by step, through analysis of existing practice,
      targeting markets, selecting desirable improvements and changes, and advertising 
      the practice. The successful results are profiled.

AB  - The growth of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider
      organizations (PPOs) has continued in the past 3 months, marked by both an
      increase in numbers and enrollment. Independent practice associations (IPAs) have
      taken the lead as the dominant model type. The intensified activity and growth in
      HMOs have resulted in considerable discussion centering on cost containment and
      quality of care issues. Employers, enrollees, the Health Care Financing
      Administration, and the HMOs, each with its own vested interest in these issues, 
      attempt to resolve the conflicts between the cost and quality of healthcare in
      prepaid plans.

TI  - Neglect: what part of abuse?
PG  - 18-24
AB  - Neglect and its consequences are important to study. At this time, there is
      little consensus on what it is specifically, but it is being reported with
      greater frequency and state agencies are concerned with the alarming number of
      incidents being called to the attention of their protective service staff. The
      purpose of this paper has been to describe some of the definitional and
      assessment problems related to elder neglect for the purpose of outlining a
      decision making aid that can guide individuals in their assessment of suspected
      neglect cases. While researchers continue to refine their understanding of the
      phenomenon of neglect, it is crucial that systematic guidelines be available
      which can assist in the evaluation of suspected neglect events. The clinical area
      may not be able to wait for the perfect definition of neglect. In the meantime,
      the health and safety of elders demands a process for consideration of the
      phenomenon.

TI  - Death by non-feeding: not in the baby's best interests.
PG  - 79-90
AB  - It has recently been suggested that doctors have a duty to act in their patient's
      best interest and that this duty demands that life-sustaining
      treatment--including food and fluids--should sometimes be withheld or withdrawn
      and the patient allowed to die. In this article, the author explores the scope of
      the 'best interests principle' in the context of treatment decisions for
      seriously handicapped newborn infants. She argues that those who hold that it is 
      permissible to starve or dehydrate an infant to death are mistaken to think that 
      this course of action is in the infant's best-interests. While it may be true
      that there are times when death is, everything considered, in an infant's best
      interests, a slow and distressing method of bringing death about is not. Since
      death by dehydration and starvation is not benign, the withholding of food and
      fluids is generally not in an infant's best interests. The author concludes by
      suggesting that whenever the withdrawal or non-employment of life-sustaining
      means imposes a heavy burden on the infant, the 'best interests principle' would 
      demand that the infant be killed rather than allowed to die.

OID - KIE: 23079
OAB - KIE: There is currently an ethical debate about whether the physician's
      obligation to act in the patient's best interests requires that life-sustaining
      treatment, including nutrition and hydration, sometimes be withheld or withdrawn 
      and the patient be allowed to die. The author examines the "best interests
      principle" in the context of treatment decisions for seriously handicapped
      newborns. She considers different types of congenital anomalies and agrees that, 
      at times, death may be in the infant's best interests. However, a slow,
      burdensome death by starvation and dehydration is not in the infant's best
      interests, and sometimes the "best interests principle" requires active rather
      than passive euthanasia.

TI  - Physicians at the bedside: practitioners' thoughts and actions regarding bedside 
      allocation of resources.
PG  - 122-32
AB  - In the past, the study of the allocation of scarce medical resources centered
      around high-technology forms of health care such as the artificial heart,
      haemodialysis, etcetera. A major controversy considered in this study concerns
      the use of non-biomedical criteria (i.e., whether the social worth or financial
      status of a particular patient should dictate preferential medical treatment over
      another patient in times of shortage) in the allocation decision-making process. 
      This article suggests that the study of allocation need not only focus on the
      dramatic realm of the high-tech, but should also concern itself with less
      dramatic everyday situations. Decisions concerning treatment based upon social
      worth and financial status are made almost daily by most practitioners; a
      thorough awareness of this phenomenon is prerequisite to the proper practice of
      medicine. Interviews with physicians disclose that most of these everyday
      allocation decisions are made tacitly, with non-biomedical criteria playing a
      role even in decisions that appear to have been prompted only by benign
      (even-guided) intentions.

OAB - KIE: A medical student doing a research project at the Hastings Center addressed 
      the issue of how socioeconomic considerations influence physician decision making
      in routine patient care. He interviewed 15 people, including cardiothoracic
      surgeons, medical educators, private practitioners, medical students and
      educators, and two dentists. His questions focused on the subjective or
      extra-clinical criteria used in the respondents' clinical allocation decisions,
      the concern for and priority of society in their daily practice, and the concerns
      and priority of their medical practice in their daily life. He concluded that
      most everyday allocation decisions are made tacitly, with nonbiomedical criteria 
      playing a role even in decisions that appear to have been intended to be
      impartial.

TI  - Rationale for organ donation: charity or duty?
PG  - 106-21
AB  - Media appeals encouraging people to sign organ donor cards suggest that donating 
      one's own organs after death or donating the organs of a deceased family member
      is an act of charity, i.e., something which it would be meritorious for people to
      do but not wrong to avoid. This paper argues to the contrary that posthumous
      organ donation is a moral duty, a duty of the type that rests at the base of
      recently enacted state "Good Samaritan" laws which require a witness to an
      emergency situation to render aid to the victim(s) when this can be done at
      minimal cost/risk to the potential rescuer.

OAB - KIE: Some commentators hold that arranging posthumous donation of one's organs or
      those of a deceased relative is an act of charity, a supererogatory deed that is 
      not obligatory. Peters argues that, given the desperate need for organs, donation
      is a moral duty. He compares the relationship between potential donor and needy
      recipient to that between potential rescuer and endangered person in an emergency
      situation, noting that some "Good Samaritan" laws have been passed requiring that
      onlookers take positive action to aid victims in grave danger when doing so
      involves little or no risk. Peters then examines legal, social, religious, and
      public policy objections to the recognition of a person's moral duty to permit
      posthumous use of his or her organs. He concludes that, while the right to
      dispose of one's body after death should be protected, public efforts to dispel
      misunderstandings about organ donation should be stepped up.

      departments are increasing productivity, lowering costs and even improving
      employee morale. But these results do not just happen. An effective training and 
      implementation program, conducted before the system is installed, is crucial if
      staff members are to become comfortable with, and not overwhelmed by, the system.
      The author describes the training program used at Grant Hospital in Chicago,
      Illinois.

TI  - Image transmission and data compression. Two key elements of an electronic
      imaging department.
PG  - 83-93
AB  - Growing numbers of diagnostic images are being produced electronically and filmed
      only for storage, or sometimes also for interpretation. However, in most imaging 
      centers, transmission of images from one location to another is still being
      accomplished manually. Almost 40 years ago, x-rays were first transmitted over
      telephone lines, and this form of "teleradiology" has been increasingly used to
      link isolated hospitals and clinics to larger facilities so that radiologists can
      interpret the images. Continuing improvement of the various electronic
      image-processing technologies has produced faster means of transmission, and
      increasingly sophisticated computer algorithms for "compressing" the image data
      have further improved both transmission speed and the quality of the transmitted 
      images. To date, only a few imaging research centers and teaching hospitals have 
      integrated these techniques into a comprehensive picture archiving and
      communications system (PACS) or digital image management system (DIMS), and a
      number of factors are restraining these systems' spread. However, electronic
      transmission of images for interpretation by specialists at a central facility is
      likely to increase, and truly "filmless" radiology may someday become a reality, 
      if image transmission and data compression techniques are eventually determined
      to create images of acceptable quality in all imaging modalities.

AB  - Decisions in the changing, competitive and highly complex health care market must
      be arrived at faster. The argument for the extensive use of computers by modern
      health care executives and the inclusion of computer training in the health
      administration curriculum rests on the fact that the survival and growth of
      health care institutions is vitally tied to the capacity of their managers to
      absorb increasingly complex data and turn it rapidly into usable information.
      Although educators cannot solve all health care industry implementation problems 
      either as consultants or as analysis in implementation studies, they must provide
      clear direction in the analytical training of future managers concerning computer
      utilization and management information systems generally. Without the basic
      foundation in knowledge, attitude, and behavior reinforcement, the risk of
      improper and insufficient computer utilization in the industry is large. This
      article examines the curricular structure, learning theory, and preliminary
      student learning and behavior outcomes of a course developed in 1985 for health
      administration students at Sangamon State University.

TI  - Alexander's dilemma: conflict between professionalism and entrepreneurialism in
      health services administration.
PG  - 581-9
AB  - Potential philosophical and socioeconomic conflicts between entrepreneurialism
      and the mandate of community service are raising difficult questions for health
      care administrators today. As those involved in the quickly evolving health care 
      field examine the knowledge base and future direction of their professional
      roles, ways must be found to reconcile the increasing economic pressures on the
      industry with the values traditionally associated with high-quality personal
      care. This article describes some of the ethical problems inherent in a health
      care system that is being run increasingly like a purely economic enterprise, and
      cites historical and sociological sources indicating that entrepreneurialism
      cannot be the primary motivation in the field of health care. The author suggests
      that "outsider entrepreneurialism" and self-interest have no place in health care
      delivery, and that the public trust and the professional identity of the health
      administration field depend upon a successful blend of personal social
      responsibility and effective and efficient community service.

TI  - The multidisciplinary renal team: who makes the decisions?
PG  - 3-9
AB  - Members of renal unit teams across Canada and in Michigan were asked to describe 
      the involvement of various occupational groups and of patients in the treatment
      decision-making process in their actual unit and in an ideal unit. All
      occupational groups shared a belief in a relatively egalitarian team, in which
      the nephrologists would have primary responsibility for decision-making and the
      other groups would be highly involved. Nephrologists perceived reality as largely
      in accord with this ideology, indicating little difference between their
      authority in actuality and in an ideal unit, and perceiving other team members as
      having greater responsibility for decision-making than those groups perceived
      themselves as having. Ambiguity existed as to the appropriate level of
      decision-making involvement for the semiprofessional roles, and a substantial
      minority of nonphysician respondents saw staff nurses in particular (as well as
      patients) as having too little involvement. The findings suggest that as a
      technology becomes routinized, the multidisciplinary team approach may become
      less realistic. The resulting dissonance between ideology and reality may lead to
      job stress and adverse effects on job functioning.

TI  - Legal limits to physician incentives: private inurement.
PG  - 16-21
AB  - For a nonprofit hospital in today's competitive climate, loss of tax-exempt
      status may be catastrophic. Recent rulings by the Internal Revenue Service
      indicate that a hospital that provides physicians with overgenerous financial
      incentives to recruit or maintain them on its medical staff risks just such a
      result. This article explores the legal doctrine of "private inurement," which
      prohibits charitable organizations from serving private interests, and the
      doctrine's application to physician incentives given by exempt hospitals. The
      article underscores the need for great caution in structuring the incentives and 
      recommends that nonprofit hospitals make a practice of obtaining advance letter
      rulings from the Service.

TI  - Biotechnology: the view from the FDA.
PG  - 10-5
AB  - What is biotechnology? This is not a naive question. The Office of Technology
      Assessment has found differing definitions of biotechnology emanating from eight 
      foreign countries and three international organizations. FDA's working definition
      of biotechnology is the application of biological systems and organisms to
      technical and industrial processes. This definition is necessarily broad. It
      takes in both the "old" and "new" science: the age-old techniques for making beer
      or yogurt as well as the most advanced uses of recombinant DNA technology. It
      takes in many applications, from production of enzymes for laundry detergents, to
      selective breeding of plants and animals, to genetic engineering of bacteria to
      clean up oil spills. As with any new technology, ethical issues are raised. But
      in the case of genetic engineering and cloning, many of the primordial fears of
      man concerning the power of science are awakened.

TI  - Pricing health care services: applications to the health maintenance
      organization.
PG  - 47-64
AB  - This article illustrates how management in one type of service industry, the
      health maintenance organization (HMO), have attempted to formalize pricing. This 
      effort is complicated by both the intangibility of the service delivered and the 
      relatively greater influence in service industries of non-cost price factors such
      as accessibility, psychology, and delays. The presentation describes a simple
      computerized approach that allows the marketing manager to formally estimate the 
      effect of incremental changes in rates on the firm's projected patterns of
      enrollment growth and net revenues. The changes in turn reflect underlying
      variations in the mix of pricing influences including psychological and other
      factors. Enrollment projections are crucial to the firm's financial planning and 
      staffing. In the past, most HMO enrollment and revenue projections of this kind
      were notoriously unreliable. The approach described here makes it possible for
      HMOs to fine-tune their pricing policies. It also provides a formal and easily
      understood mechanism by which management can evaluate and reach consensus on
      alternative scenarios for enrollment growth, staff recruitment and capacity
      expansion.

PG  - 15-9
AB  - Contrary to the myth that describes nursing in nursing homes as debasing and
      undesirable, our research affirms that LTC nursing offers opportunities for a
      rich, rewarding, and satisfying work experience. Indeed, LTC nursing practice has
      the potential to fulfill both personal and professional needs for growth and
      development. Survey data coupled with interviews of LTC nursing staff establish
      that, if well managed, the content and context of LTC nursing can provide a
      challenging and stimulating career option.

TI  - Evaluating hospital- and health-related videotapes.

AB  - In selecting hospital- and health-oriented videotapes for use with pediatric
      patients, several issues must be considered. These include the accuracy of the
      content, models for coping and mastery, age-appropriate media, and use of
      discussion or no discussion after media presentation. This paper presents
      guidelines for evaluating videotapes in light of these topics.

TI  - Programming for special groups through closed-circuit television.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - At Winnipeg's Children's Hospital Television (CHTV), there was concern that the
      closed-circuit alternative television station was not realizing its full
      potential in helping to meet the special needs of the adolescent and native
      Canadian patients. Consequently, CHTV hired workers to produce programming
      targeted at these two groups. This article documents the underlying philosophy
      and structure of this programming. It also discusses how other children's health 
      care institutions might adapt this kind of programming to suit their own groups
      with special needs.

      television is used to benefit hospitalized children in both general and pediatric
      hospitals. Based on responses from 128 hospitals, the report examines general
      information on the presence of television, the use of videocassette players, and 
      the operation of closed-circuit television stations. Topics discussed include
      equipment, funding, program selection, live programming, and, finally the need
      for a communication network specifically focused on the field of pediatric
      television.

AB  - This descriptive study addressed television viewing as part of hospitalized
      school-aged children's and adolescents' total daily activities. Thirty-two
      subjects were observed at half-hour intervals from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.
      Overall, subjects watched television 50.6% of the observational periods. Of the
      subject and environmental factors considered, only mobility status was
      significantly related to viewing. Subjects with mobility restrictions had
      increased viewing hours. The number of subjects watching television significantly
      decreased when playroom activities were available. Performance of other
      activities while viewing, and watching television with others, were also
      significantly related to lower viewing time.

      setting.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - Cases of child sexual abuse are being identified with increasing frequency in
      pediatric health care settings. Medical practitioners, however, often report
      being unprepared to offer the psychological and protective service assessments
      these cases require in addition to medical evaluation and treatment. An
      interdisciplinary model for sexual abuse assessments is described. Three
      components--emergency response, consultative services, and a specialty
      clinic--are outlined. Special problems which arise in the assessment of sexual
      abuse in the health care setting are discussed. These involve the role of medical
      evidence, stereotyping of sexual abuse victims, and impediments to child
      protection. The implications of the increasing demand for sexual abuse services
      for the training of new professionals are considered.

PG  - 281-5
AB  - In order to accommodate the ever increasing diversity and specialization of the
      practice of pharmacy, the University of Toledo College of Pharmacy (UTCP)
      Externship program has for over the past five years offered specialized
      externship experiences to selected students. UTCP has made a commitment to
      develop specific specialized objectives for each of the unique rotational
      experiences it offers. One specific area that met with a great deal of success
      over the past four years has been the experiences within the ever expanding long 
      term care pharmacy environment. During the Winter Quarter of 1985, an opportunity
      to offer an externship experience with an independent consultant in the long term
      care field arose. The development of the specific objectives and the experiences 
      that resulted from this externship rotation are described.

TI  - Hospital libraries in West Germany: an overview of reference services.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - This article presents a study on reference services in German hospital libraries.
      Information for the study was obtained through personal interviews conducted at
      four libraries in Stuttgart, West Germany in August 1985. A detailed
      questionnaire covering services provided, staff training, and use of computers
      was used during the interviews. While reference services are minimal at the
      libraries in the study, the commitment to patient library services in Germany is 
      exceptional.

AB  - Consumer health information has become an accepted and fast-growing facet of the 
      consumer movement. The questions now center on the feasibility of providing such 
      information and the best way of offering this service in the hospital setting.

PG  - 35-49
AB  - Standards for reference services were prepared by a committee of the Oregon
      Health Sciences Libraries Association (OHSLA). The standards are qualitative and 
      address the following: quality control, appropriateness, accuracy, documentation,
      timeliness, accessibility, confidentiality, and evaluation. The standards are
      components of minimally competent reference service as reflected in the reference
      product. A discussion of concerns and prescriptive measures accompanies the
      statement of each standard. While prepared specifically for health sciences
      libraries, the standards are applicable to all types of libraries and may be used
      as guidelines in evaluating the reference product, in upgrading library service, 
      and in writing policies and procedures.

TI  - Boundaries and breakdowns: applying Agar's concept of ethnography to observations
      in a pediatric clinic.
PG  - 202-10
AB  - This paper discusses a methodology for observing and describing interactions
      between clinicians and patients in an inner-city pediatric clinic serving
      families of diverse ethnicity. The framework is derived from Michael Agar's
      concept of ethnography as an interpretive, problem-resolving method. In Agar's
      model, the participant-observer moves cognitively and analytically from focusing 
      on breakdown (awareness of a problem in understanding) to resolution (applying
      knowledge structures or schemas to bounded phenomena or strips) and ultimately to
      coherence. This framework applies not only to describing what the ethnographer
      does, but also stages in the clinician's efforts to communicate. Awareness of
      repeated breakdowns allows the ethnographer to document fundamental differences
      in expectations and premises that affect communication between clinician and
      patient. Two major types of breakdowns are discussed: those occurring between
      clinic staff and families, and those occurring between staff and ethnographer.
      Terminological and analytical modifications of Agar's method are recommended to
      reflect more accurately the ethnographer's degree of involvement in the
      communication breakdown (active resolution versus passive resolution). The paper 
      concludes that Agar's model provides a useful structure for developing a
      systematic ethnographic language that can readily be demonstrated and
      communicated to clinicians.

      health care today.

AB  - The Salt Lake Clinic's problem was one of balance. Although the organizational
      values of the clinic were well developed, the organizational structure was not.
      The board of directors historically was accountable to its partners or
      shareholders, but the competitive, consumer-oriented environment also called for 
      recognition of community, business, and consumer interest. To achieve a more
      balanced approach to clinic governance, a lay advisory board was appointed, made 
      up of members active in civic affairs who each had a unique contribution to make 
      and represented a business, community, or consumer perspective.

TI  - Management by objectives in medical group practice.
PG  - 3-13
AB  - When the concept of management by objectives first emerged, it was heralded by
      many as the long-sought secret to employee motivation. The MBO technique,
      involving the three primary functions of objective setting, objective using, and 
      employee involvement, is described here in terms of both theory and practice.
      Although it does have its pitfalls and is certainly not the "ultimate answer,"
      MBO in medical group practice does have its merits when properly introduced. It
      is much more than a purely academic concept, and its major strength lies in its
      recognition of the importance of human resources in getting the job done.

TI  - The role of administrators and physicians in the legislative process.
PG  - 15-25
AB  - What can physicians, administrators, and MGMA state organizations do to direct
      their own destiny through the legislative process? Currently, as important
      matters affecting the medical profession are being discussed, there is very
      little proactive effort in dealing with the various levels of government.
      Administrators and physicians must learn to be viable political players by making
      a commitment to become involved and stay involved, to become knowledgeable about 
      the issues, and to supply input on a regular basis.

PG  - 549-52
AB  - Most cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) present with arthritis, carditis or
      choreiform movements. However, a variety of clinical manifestations which are not
      included in the modified Jones criteria can be the presenting symptoms of the
      disease. We describe a case of a 10-year-old boy with ARF who presented with
      recurrent episodes of abdominal and cervical pain who later developed an active
      carditis which established the diagnosis of ARF. A high degree of suspicion and
      an awareness of the less common manifestations of ARF are necessary to make an
      early diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment in certain cases of ARF.

AB  - A new case is presented of partial trisomy 3p in a one-year-old mentally retarded
      female infant with characteristic craniofacial dysmorphism and rare-faction of
      the stroma of the iris. The partial trisomy resulted from paternal balanced
      translocation t(3;6)(p25;p25). A review of the literature revealed that 1. both
      sexes are equally affected; 2. holoprosencephaly, found in 4 of 45 cases, may be 
      considered the major and most severe anomaly of this syndrome; 3. the life-span
      of partial trisomy 3p is shorter than generally believed as most patients with
      severe malformations probably die before karyotype studies are initiated.

TI  - Deciduous tooth eruption in children who fail to gain weight.
PG  - 501-4
AB  - In order to investigate the usefulness of the number of erupted deciduous teeth
      (NET) as a growth parameter, we studied deciduous tooth eruption (DTE) in 46
      infants between the ages of 6 and 30 months, who failed to gain weight. The cause
      of the failure to thrive was intrauterine growth retardation in 17 children, and 
      undetermined in 29. In these babies, height and head circumference were
      significantly below the mean as well. However, NET was almost unchanged when
      compared to NET of Israeli children of the same age. These findings support the
      view that DTE is an independent process, unrelated to other anthropometric
      measurements. Thus, NET may not be used as a clinical parameter of physical
      development.

PG  - 495-500
AB  - Three patients with immune neutropenia successfully treated with high dose
      intravenous IgG (IV IgG) are described. In the first case, the neutropenia had
      not responded to standard steroid therapy; in the second case, very high doses of
      steroids were required in order to obtain and maintain remission. In the last
      case, the steroids were contraindicated because of an underlying immunologic
      disorder. We suggest that these 3 forms of immune neutropenia might be a good
      indication for IV IgG treatment.

AB  - We describe 9 infants (ranging from 1 to 6 1/2 months) in whom a surgical
      pathology (gastro-esophageal reflux and/or pyloric stenosis) was associated with 
      cow's milk intolerance (CMI). In all cases vomiting and/or failure to thrive did 
      not disappear after surgery. The patients recovered only after dietary
      manipulation by cow's milk protein free diet. In 5 out of 9 cases, multiple food 
      intolerances were present (soy and/or casein hydrolysates). In all cases the
      diagnosis of CMI was confirmed by challenge test. The connections between CMI and
      abdominal surgery in infancy are discussed.

AB  - The characteristics of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in children have
      been described in several reports. The occurrence of specific anti-HTLV-III/LAV
      seropositivity in children born to seropositive mothers is also becoming more
      frequent in Italy. We report 15 cases of seropositive children born to 14
      seropositive, drug-addicted mothers. Among them, 5 died of AIDS, 8 developed a
      variable, non-progressive AIDS-related complex (ARC), while only two remained
      persistently asymptomatic. Liver disease was present in 2 patients, CNS disease
      in 4, gastrointestinal troubles were never a major problem. Only 2 cases of HBV
      infection and 3 of thrombocytopenia were observed. In our experience, homosexual 
      behaviour of the parents was never a cause of family risk. Children presented
      with failure to thrive and/or signs of disease usually within the first five
      months of life. In one family the first child was affected by fatal AIDS while
      the younger child showed only passive, transient immunization by maternal
      specific IgG. One ARC patient, observed for over 3 years, showed apparently
      complete healing from the disease.

      compressive myelopathy, cerebrospinal fluid fistula and tracheal stenosis in an
      adult patient].
PG  - 515-30
AB  - A 25-year-old male with the severe form of Maroteaux-Lamy disease
      (mucopolysaccharidosis VI-A) developed rhinoliquorrhea of undetermined origin.
      The head was held permanently in extension, and there was both inspiratory and
      expiratory stridor. Flexion of the head worsened the stridor and caused dyspnea. 
      Radiological examination showed a massive narrowing of the trachea and a marked
      retropharyngeal and retrotracheal swelling. Hyperreflexia and slight impairment
      of the sensation of the lower limbs were found on neurological examination.
      Computed tomography revealed hydrocephalus and extreme narrowing of the
      subarachnoid space in the region of the occipito-cervical junction, caused by
      marked epidural soft tissue thickening and a dysplastic arch of the atlas
      protruding dorsally into the foramen magnum, and displacement of the cervical
      spinal cord. At the age of 26 years rhinoliquorrhea suddenly stopped and the
      patient developed acute signs of occlusive hydrocephalus. Emergency
      ventriculo-peritoneal shunting was performed.

TI  - San Diego's Alzheimer's family center.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - In its four years of operation, the Alzheimer's Family Center in San Diego has
      demonstrated that it is possible to provide day care to a population of dementia 
      patients which is predominantly moderate to low functioning. The program works
      best in a homelike atmosphere. It requires a high staff/patient ratio and must be
      supervised at all times by a registered nurse. Activities encourage
      nonintellectual skills, with an emphasis on building self-esteem, enhancing
      social interaction, and stimulating the maximum degree of functioning possible.
      Family members are an integral part of the program and receive educational,
      counseling, and supportive services are well. Key to the success of the program
      is the ability to train and supervise staff in behavioral management approaches, 
      relying primarily on non-verbal communication.

      won't do a thing to prevent it. All I can do is pray". Is there anything more
      that can be done to prevent or eliminate AIDS among intravenous drug users? The
      following survey conducted at Spectrum House of Westboro and Worcester,
      Massachusetts, seeks to identify the needs and thoughts of this group of
      individuals who are at a high risk for contracting AIDS, in hopes of providing a 
      solution to this national crisis--something in addition to prayer.

TI  - Health care use by Medicare's disabled enrollees.
PG  - 19-31
AB  - Three million persons under age 65 are entitled to Medicare because of
      disability. This study examines their Medicare use and mortality. Disabled
      enrollees had higher health care use and mortality than comparison groups of
      Medicare's aged enrollees or of the general population under age 65. One type of 
      disabled enrollee, adults disabled as children (over one-half of whom are
      mentally retarded) show lower use rates than the other types of
      enrollees--workers and widows. High mortality of the disabled during the 2-year
      waiting period for Medicare suggests the need to investigate how they pay for
      care during this period.

TI  - DRG-based prospective payment: what does the future hold?
PG  - 8-12
AB  - This article addresses the future of the diagnosis-related group-based
      prospective payment system currently used by the Health Care Financing
      Administration to pay hospitals for care of Medicare patients. Criticisms of the 
      present system are discussed from the standpoint of the quality of the
      classification system itself, the process by which rates are set using it, and
      the behavior of providers as a result of the system. Based upon this discussion, 
      the conclusion is reached that it is unlikely that extensions of case-mix based
      payment for physicians' care and for other non-hospital-based services are
      feasible. Capitation is an alternative payment mechanism, already in place in
      some settings and proving increasingly popular.

TI  - Contradictions in federal policies put elderly at risk of health care neglect.
PG  - 5-12
AB  - Federal and state efforts to control hospital costs have increased the demand for
      home health services, especially services for the more acutely ill patient. At
      the same time, recent regulatory policies on Medicare eligibility and
      reimbursement are limiting the ability of home health agencies to respond.
      Examination of New Jersey home health data and case examples illustrate the
      increased demand, conflict with federal policy (as experienced in claim denials
      and loss of waiver of liability), and effect on patients and their families.

TI  - Testing a diagnosis-related group index for skilled nursing facilities.
PG  - 75-85
AB  - Interest in case-mix measures for use in nursing home payment systems has been
      stimulated by the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for short-term
      acute-care hospitals. Appropriately matching payment with care needs is important
      to equitably compensate providers and to encourage them to admit patients who are
      most in need of nursing home care. The skilled nursing facility (SNF) Medicare
      benefit covers skilled convalescent or rehabilitative care following a hospital
      stay. Therefore, it might appear that diagnosis-related groups (DRG's), the basis
      for patient classification in PPS, could also be used for the Medicare SNF
      program. In this study, a DRG-based case-mix index (CMI) was developed and tested
      to determine how well it explains cost differences among SNF's. The results
      suggest that a DRG-based SNF payment system would be highly problematic.
      Incentives of this system would appear to discourage placement of patients who
      require relatively expensive care.

TI  - Setting health maintenance organization capitation rates for Medicaid in
      Wisconsin.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - In late fall 1984, more than 110,000 Wisconsin Aid to Families with Dependent
      Children (AFDC) Medicaid recipients were enrolled in health maintenance
      organizations (HMO's). Capitation rates were set by competitive bidding, subject 
      to a rate ceiling. Planners considered whether to adjust the rates to account for
      demographic changes in the AFDC population between the time that data for the
      rate ceilings were collected and when the rates went into effect. They also
      considered whether to pay a single rate or to adjust rates for the age and sex of
      each HMO's actual enrollees. This article is a report of the analysis that led to
      a decision to pay a single, countywide rate that was not demographically
      adjusted.

TI  - Medicare case-mix index increase.
PG  - 51-65
AB  - Medicare paid hospitals a higher amount per admission in 1984 than had been
      planned because the case-mix index (CMI), which reflects the proportion of
      patients in high-weighted DRG's versus low-weighted ones, increased more than had
      been projected. This study estimated the degree to which the increase in the CMI 
      from 1981 reflected medical practice changes, the aging of the Medicare inpatient
      population, changes in coding practices of physicians and hospitals, and changes 
      in the way that the Health Care Financing Administration collects the data on
      case-mix. All of the above, except for aging, contributed to the increase in the 
      CMI.

TI  - A profile of functionally impaired elderly persons living in the community.
PG  - 33-49
AB  - The Health Care Financing Administration, in cooperation with other agencies of
      the Department of Health and Human Services, conducted surveys in 1982 and 1984
      designed to develop a better understanding of the number and circumstances of
      functionally impaired elderly persons living in the community. This report is
      based on data from the 1982 Long-Term Care Survey. There were approximately 5
      million functionally impaired elderly persons living in the community in 1982.
      The data show that functionally impaired persons in the community are older, are 
      more often female, have lower incomes, and have a larger proportion of black
      people than the general elderly population. The data also provide baseline
      information on what functional impairments are prevalent among them, what means
      they use to cope with the limitations, and from whom they receive help. The
      baselines data gathered in 1982 will be supplemented by longitudinal data
      gathered in the 1984 Long-Term Care Survey.

AB  - By several measures of health status, the Medicaid population is in worse health 
      than are persons without Medicaid. In addition, poor persons without Medicaid
      coverage are in poorer health than those who are not poor. Use of health services
      among those in poor health shows Medicaid eligibles use services at a level
      comparable to those who are not poor and without Medicaid. Among the poor without
      Medicaid, the reduced likelihood of seeing a physician and purchasing a
      prescribed drug indicates the importance of Medicaid coverage in obtaining access
      to care.

TI  - Implications of physician reimbursement reform: patient access and physicians'
      practice.
PG  - 19-23
AB  - Physicians have been and will continue to be key agents in the health care
      delivery system. Their relative role and methods of practice, however, are
      undergoing significant change. This change has been induced by increased
      competitiveness, continued efforts at cost containment, and changes in
      reimbursement methods. While the most dramatic change in reimbursement
      (diagnosis-related groups, DRGs) was directed at the hospital, the reform of
      physician reimbursement is currently a high priority of the federal government.
      Changes in federal payments to physicians have significant implications for
      physicians and their patients. Several recent developments, indeed, may become
      the trends of the latter part of the 1980s. These developments include changes in
      physicians' practice mode, lower returns to medical education, increased
      diversification of physicians' activities, changes in relative earnings of
      physicians by specialty and age, restricted physician choice for some patients,
      and increased problems with overall access.

PG  - 13-8
AB  - Utilization review and the current Medicare prospective payment system are part
      of a continuum of Federal legislation aimed at controlling scarce health care
      resources. Physicians have met these attempts to establish standards of
      utilization and fiscal control with varying levels of cooperation and resistance.
      This paper examines the physician's perceived threat to professional practice
      that these allocation strategies represent. The paper addresses four major areas 
      of concern: bureaucratic tensions; income; clinical decision-making; and
      self-regulation. The paper ends by discussing the benefits for physicians in
      taking a proactive stance toward these measures.

      and trainee feedback complement its institutional flexibility and make this a
      truly revolutionary method for continuing education and initial instruction of
      all health professionals. Interactive video can be employed to evaluate
      objectively hospital staff performance standards and as such may help satisfy the
      hospital's burden of staff quality control. In addition, it may be a cost-saving 
      measure by reducing training personnel expenditures. The following article
      describes the benefits of this budding technology and its application in health
      care.

TI  - Prospective payment: systemic effects on the provision of community care for the 
      elderly.
PG  - 93-117
AB  - The financial incentives of Medicare's Prospective Payment System are encouraging
      hospitals to discharge patients sooner and at a lower functional status. This
      discussion analyzes the possible impact of the subacute patient on the community 
      system of care. Three broad areas of potential impact are examined: the systemic 
      changes in the community system of care stimulated by vertical integration and
      the influx of proprietaries into community service delivery; structural changes
      which may be experienced by community service agencies in meeting the demands of 
      increased volume and increased acuity; the impact on the family and the informal 
      system of care delivery as it responds to the increased demands of caring for the
      subacute patient.

TI  - Medicare payment for new technologies. Can the process be improved despite
      conflicting goals? An ECRI technology management assessment.
PG  - 13-32
AB  - Decisions about Medicare payment for new technologies are made by a multiagency
      process that became even more complex with the advent of DRG-based payments for
      inpatient care. Numerous problems with this decision-making process are widely
      acknowledged to exist but difficult to solve because of inherent conflicting
      goals. This report proposes consideration of basic improvements to the process,
      including: increased support for clinical and cost studies, particularly from
      manufacturers of new technologies; approval of provisional payments to providers 
      who agree to collect effectiveness and cost data; additional research into
      technology assessment methods; clarification of decision-making criteria; opening
      of the coverage-decision process to greater public scrutiny; according more
      weight to recommendations of the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission;
      submission of additional data to the Food and Drug Administration; and increasing
      the flow of information among Medicare coverage-decision agencies and other
      third-party payers. Many of these modifications can be accomplished without
      congressional action, if the interested parties are willing to work together to
      improve the coverage-decision process.

TI  - Polygraph testing--a comprehensive literature review of an ethical dilemma.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide pharmacy educators with knowledge
      regarding the polygraph. These facts are valuable in training and counseling
      students and are prerequisite to making informed decisions as leaders in the
      profession. Businesses lose six-billion dollars annually to employee theft. One
      in four U.S. employers currently use the polygraph on employees, and pharmacists 
      are frequently subject to the procedure. Several U.S. corporations report the
      lowest loss rates in the industry without resorting to the polygraph. They
      utilize traditional techniques of security, accounting, and personnel
      administration. Patterns of nonspecific autonomic responses modified by race,
      sociability, moral development, interpersonal climate, education, pain, and
      exercise level, indicate that the procedure is not valid. The procedure yields
      approximately 11 percent false positive and 2 percent false negative results. No 
      licensure is required in 24 states, and 40 states allow employers to use the
      technique at will. NACDS and NARD support of the polygraph, while the APHA and
      the Retail Clerks Union oppose it.

TI  - Clinical applications of SPECT imaging. An ECRI technology assessment.
PG  - 33-62
AB  - Many hospitals are considering acquiring the capability to do single photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. An outgrowth of planar nuclear
      medicine imaging, combined with computerized methods for gathering and processing
      data, SPECT can provide three-dimensional radionuclide imaging information,
      determine regional blood flow, and measure organ volumes. The past decade's
      record of research using SPECT, coupled with improvements in instrumentation and 
      the development of additional clinically useful radiopharmaceuticals, has fueled 
      the interest in SPECT. It is apparent that SPECT, with recognized applications in
      cardiac, liver, and bone imaging, offers improvements over planar scanning and
      provides unique contributions when compared with other imaging techniques.
      Preliminary research, both about SPECT and in the development of new
      radiopharmaceuticals that can cross the blood/brain barrier, points to dramatic
      potential uses in neurology, including measuring brain physiology. There are,
      however, less data on the effect SPECT imaging can have on patient care outcomes 
      and about its relative clinical and cost effectiveness. Until further research
      provides these data, SPECT will remain a difficult acquisition decision. If SPECT
      capability can be acquired relatively inexpensively through add-ons to existing
      equipment, or if a hospital has a burgeoning nuclear medicine or nuclear
      cardiology service, the decision is easier. Pending further information, other
      hospitals can facilitate future acquisition of SPECT by ensuring that any newly
      purchased gamma cameras and nuclear medicine computers can be upgraded and
      incorporated into a SPECT system. Hospitals should also follow the growing body
      of research about SPECT's clinical usefulness.

TI  - Perceived needs of Canadian dietitians for continuing education in management.
PG  - 155, 158-61
AB  - The purpose of this research was to assess the perceived needs of Canadian
      dietitians for continuing education in management both currently and as they plan
      for advancement, career change and development. A self-assessment questionnaire
      was mailed in January 1985 to 1000 members of the Canadian Dietetic Association
      (CDA) selected by a systematic randomized technique. Analysis of 450 anonymous
      questionnaires from employed CDA members showed that 77% were employed full-time 
      and 23% part time. The analysis indicated a profession with a young membership of
      an eight-year mean and a six-year median in full time practice. A ranked ordering
      of the types of positions to which dietitians aspired was chief administrative
      dietitian, consultant, positions in other administration, and then private
      practice. Personnel and financial management were very important areas for
      current positions and were expected to be even more so in future. Respondents
      cited salient factors regarding continuing education programs and prioritized
      their need for several management topics. These topics were further analyzed
      according to the present positions of the respondents. This research supports the
      need for high quality continuing education programs in management for practising 
      dietitians.

TI  - Absence of xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase in the rabbit myocardium.
PG  - 1104-8
AB  - We directly measured the activity of the enzymes xanthine oxidase and xanthine
      dehydrogenase in rabbit and rat hearts, using a sensitive radiochemical assay.
      Neither xanthine oxidase activity nor xanthine dehydrogenase activity was
      detected in the rabbit heart. In the rat heart, xanthine oxidase activity was 9.1
      +/- 0.5 mIU per gram wet weight and xanthine dehydrogenase activity was 53.0 +/- 
      1.9 mIU per gram wet weight. These results argue against the involvement of the
      xanthine oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase system as a mechanism of tissue injury in
      the rabbit heart, and suggest that the ability of allopurinol to protect the
      rabbit heart against hypoxic or ischemic damage must be due to a mechanism other 
      than inhibition of these enzymes.

TI  - Actions of LH/hCG on accumulation and catabolism of progestins in cultured rat
      granulosa cells.
PG  - 1025-31
AB  - Immature hypophysectomized rats were treated with estradiol-17 beta and
      follicle-stimulating hormone. Granulosa cells were isolated and incubated for 24 
      h with or without varying doses of ovine luteinizing hormone (NIMADD-oLH-24) or
      human chorionic gonadotropin (NIADDK CR 125) and accumulations of progesterone
      and 20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one were determined. The cells were reincubated 
      for 3 h with [4-14C]progesterone (0.5 nmol/mL) and the radiolabelled metabolites 
      were separated and quantified. Both LH (0.04-1.0 ug/mL) and hCG (0.04-1.0 ug/mL) 
      enhanced the accumulation of endogenous progesterone (by up to 300 and 150%,
      respectively) and 20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (by up to 90 and 85%,
      respectively) producing dose-dependent increases of the ratio of progesterone to 
      20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (by up to 125 and 70%, respectively). Studies of
      the metabolism of [1-14C] progesterone have demonstrated that both LH and hCG led
      to a dose-dependent decrease of the utilization of radiolabelled progesterone
      (down to 64 and 70%, respectively, of the control value). This effect was
      associated with an LH- and hCG-dependent inhibition of 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid
      dehydrogenase activity (down to 60 and 70%, respectively, of the control value)
      but had no significant effect on 5 alpha-reductase. The present results indicate 
      that LH and hCG stimulate accumulation of progesterone at least in part by
      decreasing the 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor as an intraovarian hormone: differential regulation of
      steroidogenesis by an angiogenic factor.
PG  - 243-50
AB  - The potential role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in the regulation of
      granulosa cell differentiation was investigated because of its recent
      identification as the corpus luteum angiogenic factor. Treatment of rat ovarian
      granulosa cells with FGF inhibits the capacity of follicle stimulating hormone to
      stimulate estrogen production and to induce luteinizing hormone receptors. In
      contrast, although incubations with FGF can inhibit the estrogen-sensitive
      component of progesterone synthesis, the presence of FGF with suboptimal
      concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone significantly enhances the
      synthesis of progesterone. This capacity to differentially regulate
      steroidogenesis in the granulosa cell is comparable to the potency of FGF (ED50 =
      30 pg/ml, 10(-12) M) in other in vitro assays. The observation that an angiogenic
      factor, like FGF, can specifically increase the sensitivity of progesterone
      synthesis and simultaneously inhibit estrogen formation supports the hypothesis
      that this growth factor plays an important role in the development and
      maintenance of a functional corpus luteum. As such, FGF may be involved in the
      local regulation of follicular selection, growth and atresia by simple virtue of 
      its capacity to induce a neovascular response on one hand and by its ability to
      modulate the differentiated response to gonadotropins on the other.

AB  - The exchange of 18O from CO2 to H2O in aqueous solution is caused by the
      hydration-dehydration cycle and is catalyzed by the carbonic anhydrases. In our
      previous studies of 18O exchange at chemical equilibrium catalyzed by isozymes I 
      and II of carbonic anhydrase, we observed simple first-order depletion of 18O
      from CO2 with the 18O distribution among the species C18O18O, C16O18O, and
      C16O16O described by the binomial expansion (i.e., a random distribution of 18O).
      Using membrane-inlet mass spectrometry, we have measured 18O exchange between CO2
      and H2O catalyzed by native zinc-containing and cobalt(II)-substituted carbonic
      anhydrase III from bovine skeletal muscle near pH 7.5. The distributions of 18O
      in CO2 deviate from the binomial expansion and are accompanied by biphasic
      18O-exchange patterns; moreover, we observed regions in which 18O loss from CO2
      was faster than 18O loss from HCO3-. These data are interpreted in terms of a
      model that includes 18O loss from an enzyme-substrate or intermediate complex. We
      conclude that more than one 18O can be lost from CO2 per encounter with the
      active site of isozyme III, a process that requires scrambling of oxygens in a
      bicarbonate-enzyme complex and cycling between intermediate complexes. This
      suggests that the rate of dissociation of H2(18)O (or 18OH-) from isozyme III is 
      comparable to or faster than substrate and product dissociation.

PG  - 993-9
AB  - Glyoxalase I was purified to apparent homogeneity from Pseudomonas putida. The
      enzyme was a monomer with a molecular weight of 20,000. The enzyme was most
      active at pH 8.0. The Km values for methylglyoxal and 4,5-dioxovale-rate are 3.5 
      mM and 1.2 mM, respectively. Contrary to the case of eukaryotic enzymes,
      chelating agents showed little inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity. Among
      the metal ions tested, Zn++ specifically and completely inhibited the activity of
      the enzyme at a millimolar level. The properties of bacterial glyoxalase I were
      quite different from mammalian and yeast enzymes.

AB  - Incubation of glomerular homogenates (200 micrograms protein) with glomerular
      basement membrane (GBM, 30-35 micrograms hydroxyproline) at pH 7.5 for 36 h at 37
      degrees C resulted in significant GBM degradation as measured by hydroxyproline
      release (40 +/- 6%, n = 17). GBM degradation increased with increasing incubation
      time (12-48 h) and glomerular protein concentration (50-250 micrograms). GBM
      degradation was not significantly decreased by inhibitors of serine or cysteine
      proteinases or the inhibitor of bacterial metalloproteinases, phosphoramidon. In 
      contrast GBM degradation by glomerular homogenates was markedly inhibited by the 
      metal chelators 10mM EDTA (-95 +/- 3%, n = 7) and 2mM 1,10-phenanthroline (-96
      +/- 2%, n = 4). Preincubation of glomerular homogenates with trypsin (followed by
      soya bean trypsin inhibitor) markedly stimulated GBM degradation (+103 +/- 20%, n
      = 11). These results document the presence of a GBM-degrading, neutral
      metalloproteinase(s) in glomeruli suggesting an important role for this enzyme in
      glomerular pathophysiology.

PG  - 1236-41
AB  - Using isolated cartilage cells from the epiphyseal growth plate of rachitic
      chicks and utilizing the fluorescence indicator quin2 for measurements of
      cytosolic free calcium, it has been possible to demonstrate that
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 regulates the concentrations of cytosolic free calcium. 
      The reduction in cytosolic free calcium is associated with inhibition of the
      activity of alkaline phosphatase. As several hours are required before an effect 
      on cytosolic free calcium can be observed in the cells, it is suggested that the 
      action is dependent on genomic interactions.

TI  - Glucose 6-phosphate plays a central role in the activation of glycogen synthase
      by glucose in hepatocytes.
PG  - 1195-200
AB  - The state of activation of glycogen synthase enhanced by glucose, other sugars
      and gluconeogenic precursors shows a strong positive correlation with the
      intracellular concentrations of glucose 6-P when ATP concentrations remain
      constant. The concentrations of glucose 6-P achieved upon incubation of
      hepatocytes with glucose plus mannoheptulose, an inhibitor of glucokinase and
      hexokinase, were lower than those found when the incubation was carried out with 
      glucose alone. Under these conditions, in keeping with the decrease in glucose
      6-P, the activation of glycogen synthase by glucose was also impaired. On the
      other hand the inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase was not altered in the
      presence of mannoheptulose.

PG  - 275-82
AB  - An assay of apolipoproteins (Apo) C-II, C-III and E in human sera by single
      radial immunodiffusion (SRID) is described. The procedure involves pretreatment
      of the serum sample with surfactant to facilitate diffusion of very low density
      lipoproteins in agarose. This allowed measurement of apolipoproteins in lipidemic
      sera by SRID in agarose gel. The intraplate coefficient of variation was less
      than 2.5%, and the interplate coefficient of variation, less than 3.0%.
      Correlation with double-antibody radioimmunoassay produced the following
      coefficients of correlation: gamma = 0.9931 (n = 17) for Apo C-II, gamma = 0.9221
      (n = 33) for Apo C-III, and gamma = 0.9340 (n = 17) for Apo E.

TI  - Kaposi's sarcoma of the conjunctiva and CMV-retinitis in AIDS.
PG  - 77-85
AB  - The number of AIDS patients is still increasing. In 30-50% of these patients
      ocular lesions occur, which are of diagnostic and prognostic significance. If the
      life-span of AIDS patients lengthens in the future, adequate treatment of the
      ocular conditions will become increasingly important. The two most important
      ocular manifestations AIDS are CMV-retinitis and Kaposi's sarcoma of the
      conjunctiva. DHPG, a new virustatic for human cytomegalovirus, appears promising 
      as treatment for the severe CMV-retinitis, which leads rapidly to blindness. Two 
      case histories illustrate the preliminary results obtained with DHPG treatment.
      Kaposi's sarcoma of the conjunctiva is relatively benign is AIDS and can be
      treated successfully by surgical excision, radiotherapy, cryotherapy or local
      injections of cytostatics.

PG  - 321-9
AB  - The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonist, alpha-helical
      [Glu27]-corticotropin-releasing factor 9-41 (CRF 9-41) has been assessed for its 
      ability to modify plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine, mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Basal concentrations of epinephrine 
      and norepinephrine were not altered by lateral ventricular (icv) administration
      of CRF 9-41. However, this CRF antagonist, given icv, attenuated the rise of
      plasma epinephrine following 30% hemorrhage and insulin-induced hypoglycemia. CRF
      9-41 did not alter the increased plasma concentrations of epinephrine or
      norepinephrine following icv administration of bombesin. Icv administration of
      CRF 9-41 blunted CRF-induced elevation of MAP and HR in normal animals. However, 
      this CRF antagonist did not modify the MAP or HR in spontaneously hypertensive
      rats. Similarly, this CRF antagonist administered to Sprague-Dawley rats neither 
      prevented the rise of MAP or HR following electrical stimulation of the central
      nucleus of the amygdala, nor did it affect nitroprusside-induced hypotension and 
      tachycardia.

TI  - Alcohol reverses the proconflict effect of corticotropin-releasing factor.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - Alcohol has tension reducing properties in man that are reflected in a release of
      punished responding in a rat operant conflict test. In contrast, corticotropin
      releasing factor (CRF), injected centrally produces a suppression of punished and
      non-punished responding in the conflict test consistent with its hypothesized
      role in mediating behavioral responses to stress. Alcohol in a dose of 0.75 g/kg 
      reversed the suppressive effects of 0.5 microgram CRF injected
      intracerebroventricularly on punished responding but augmented the suppression of
      unpunished responding by CRF. Results suggest that one mechanism for the tension 
      reducing properties of acute alcohol intoxication may involve a suppression of
      brain CRF systems.

TI  - Opioid inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor secretion into
      the hypophysial-portal circulation of rats.
PG  - 235-42
AB  - The role of the opioid peptides in the regulation of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)
      secretion remains unclear. In rats, morphine and the enkephalins exert a
      stimulatory effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, while
      beta-endorphin (beta-E) and dynorphin (DYN) are reported to have stimulatory or
      inhibitory activity. Alternatively, data from human studies indicate a clear
      inhibitory role of opiates. In the present studies, secretion of immunoreactive
      corticotropin releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation
      was directly measured before and after intracerebroventricular administration of 
      beta-E, DYN and naltrexone (NTX). Both beta-E and DYN were equipotent in their
      dose-related inhibition of irCRF secretion. The inhibitory action of beta-E was
      reversed by NTX, while the action of DYN was only partially blocked.
      Administration of NTX alone resulted in a significant elevation of spontaneous
      and stimulated irCRF secretion. Finally, injection (icv) of 1.0 nmol beta-E or
      DYN blocked the nitroprusside-hypotension induced elevation of irCRF. These
      observations suggest, that under the conditions of these experiments, exogenous
      beta-E acting primarily via mu opioid receptors and DYN acting via kappa and mu
      receptors exert tonic inhibitory effects on the activity of CRF secreting cells. 
      Furthermore, it appears that beta-E and DYN are capable of modulating
      (inhibiting) stimulated secretion of irCRF and thus activity of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

TI  - Chromogranin A, B and C: immunohistochemical localization in ovine pituitary and 
      the relationship with hormone-containing cells.
PG  - 217-33
AB  - Chromogranins A, B and C, three distinct groups of proteins found in bovine
      chromaffin granules, were also found to be present in the pituitary using
      immunoblotting techniques. Their distribution was therefore studied in the normal
      ram pituitary using an immunoperoxidase technique applied to semithin serial
      sections and compared with that of some of the hormones of the anterior
      pituitary. Chromogranin-immunoreactivity was found in gonadotrophs (all three),
      thyrotrophs (A with some positive for C) and corticotrophs (a fraction with A and
      fewer with B and C). The mammotrophs and somatotrophs were negative. Chromogranin
      C was the only one of the three to be located in the pars nervosa, whilst
      chromogranin B was rarely found in the pars intermedia. The results suggest that 
      chromogranins A, B and C are not always stored together, some hormone-containing 
      cells do not contain immunohistologically detectable levels of the chromogranins.

TI  - Atrial natriuretic factor receptor on cultured Leydig tumor cells: ligand binding
      and photoaffinity labeling.
PG  - 8467-72
AB  - Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone discovered recently from the
      heart atrium that possesses potent natriuretic and vasorelaxant activities.
      Recently we found that ANF markedly stimulates intracellular cGMP and almost
      completely inhibits cAMP accumulation in testicular interstitial tumor cells
      [Pandey, K. N., Kovacs, W. J., & Inagami, T. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res.
      Commun. 133, 800-806]. These actions of ANF suggest the presence of ANF receptors
      in testicular interstitial cells. In this study, cultured murine Leydig tumor
      cells have been shown to contain specific binding sites for ANF. Saturation
      binding studies indicated a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 5 X 10(-9)
      M at a density of 2 X 10(6) sites/cell. The binding of mono[125I]iodo-ANF
      (125I-ANF) was competed by unlabeled ANF in a dose-dependent manner. Hormones
      unrelated to ANF such as angiotensin I, bovine luteinizing hormone, and human
      chorionic gonadotropin were not able to compete against 125I-ANF. The binding of 
      125I-ANF was rapid, reaching maximum levels in 15 min at 4 degrees C. At 37
      degrees C, the cell-bound 125I label was quickly decreased. Pretreatment of cells
      with NH4Cl, chloroquine, or NaN3 resulted in significant increases in maximum
      levels of the cell-bound 125I radioactivity. A photoaffinity reagent for ANF
      receptor was prepared by reacting ANF with succinimido 4-azidobenzoate, and
      resultant 4-azidobenzoyl- (AZB-) ANF was purified by high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC). AZB-ANF was radioiodinated by use of chloramine T and
      purified again by HPLC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Construction and characterization of a site-directed CC-1065-N3-adenine adduct
      within a 117 base pair DNA restriction fragment.
PG  - 8430-6
AB  - The design, construction, and characterization of a site-directed
      CC-1065-N3-adenine adduct in a 117 base pair segment of M13mpI DNA are described.
      CC-1065 is an extremely potent antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces
      zelensis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cyclopropyl ring of CC-1065
      reacts quite specifically with N3 of adenine in double-stranded DNA to form a
      CC-1065-DNA adduct. Following alkylation, the drug molecule lies snugly within
      the minor groove of DNA, overlapping with five base pairs for which a marked
      sequence preference exists [Hurley, L. H., Reynolds, V. R., Swenson, D. H.,
      Petzold, G. L., & Scahill, T. A. (1984) Science (Washington, D.C.) 226, 843-844].
      On the basis of the unique characteristics of the reaction of CC-1065 with DNA
      and the structure of the resulting DNA adduct, we have designed a general
      strategy to construct a site-directed CC-1065-DNA adduct in a restriction
      fragment. The presence of unique AluI and HaeIII restriction enzymes sites on
      each side of a high-affinity CC-1065 binding sequence (5'-GATTA) permitted the
      preparation of a partial duplex DNA molecule containing the CC-1065 binding
      sequence in the duplex DNA region. Since CC-1065 only binds to duplex DNA,
      potential CC-1065 binding sequences in the long single-stranded regions were
      protected from drug binding during the construction process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

TI  - Partial amino acid sequence of human thrombospondin as determined by analysis of 
      cDNA clones: homology to malarial circumsporozoite proteins.
PG  - 8418-25
AB  - A lambda gt 11 library prepared from human umbilical vein endothelial cell RNA
      was screened for cDNAs encoding thrombospondin. Reagents included a monospecific 
      antibody to human thrombospondin and a mixture of four synthetic
      oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from an amino acid sequence near the NH2
      terminus of mature human thrombospondin. Two series of cDNA clones coding for
      sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of thrombospondin mRNA, respectively, were
      isolated. The nucleotide sequence of a 1.3-kilobase (kb) 5' clone (lambda TS-33) 
      coded for 99 bases of 5' untranslated RNA, a signal peptide of 18 amino acids,
      and the first 379 amino acids of thrombospondin. Northern blot analysis with
      lambda TS-33 detected a single mRNA species of approximately 6.0 kb in rat aortic
      smooth muscle cell RNA. Thrombospondin mRNA levels increased rapidly, but
      transiently, in quiescent smooth muscle cells treated with platelet-derived
      growth factor. The kinetics of this response were very similar to those of the
      thrombospondin protein to this growth factor. There was significant homology in
      amino acid sequence between thrombospondin and a conserved region in the
      circumsporozoite protein of two malarial sporozoites. This region of
      thrombospondin may therefore represent a potential recognition site for a cell
      surface thrombospondin receptor.

TI  - Purification and characterization of high Ca2+-requiring neutral proteases from
      porcine and bovine brains.
PG  - 8396-402
AB  - Porcine and bovine brain high Ca2+-requiring neutral proteases were purified to
      homogeneity by the same isolation procedures, and their properties were compared.
      A high degree of similarity existed between the two proteases. The purification
      procedures included ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydrophobic
      chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, second DEAE-cellulose chromatography,
      second phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, and gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 
      34. Both purified enzymes were composed of Mr 75,000 and 29,000 subunits, as
      shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both enzymes 
      required 250 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal activity and 700 microM Ca2+ for
      maximal activity. Sr2+ and Ba2+, but not Mg2+ or Mn2+, also activated both
      enzymes but not as effectively as Ca2+. Both enzymes displayed maximum activity
      at pH 7.5-8.0. Leupeptin, antipain, and trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylagmatine
      inhibited both enzymes. Neurofilament triplet proteins and microtubule-associated
      proteins were extensively hydrolyzed by both proteases, but tubulin and actin
      were not hydrolyzed. The amino acid compositions of the two proteases were very
      similar. Antisera against bovine brain protease cross-reacted with porcine brain 
      protease when examined by immunoelectrotransfer blot techniques.

TI  - Domain organization of chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase deduced from a
      cloned cDNA.
PG  - 8372-81
AB  - Myosin light chain kinases (MLCK) are the most studied of the
      calmodulin-activated enzymes; however, minimal sequence information is available 
      for the smooth muscle form of the enzyme. The production of an antibody against
      the enzyme and the use of expression vectors for constructing cDNA libraries have
      facilitated the isolation of a cDNA for this kinase. The derived amino sequence
      was found to contain a region of high homology (54%) to the rabbit skeletal
      muscle enzyme and also very significant homology (35%) to the catalytic subunit
      of phosphorylase b kinase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. All of these
      homologies were found in the known catalytic domains of these enzyme, thus
      enabling us to predict the location of the catalytic domain for the chicken
      gizzard myosin light chain kinase. Within the catalytic domain a consensus
      sequence for an ATP-binding site was located. Subcloning and expression of
      different regions of the cDNA defined a 192 base pair fragment coding for the
      calmodulin-binding domain of MLCK. Both of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase
      phosphorylation sites were identified by sequence homology. A linear model for
      MLCK is presented placing the various domains in relative position. Northern blot
      analysis and S1 protection and mapping experiments have revealed that the mRNA
      for MLCK is 5.5 kilobases in length, but there also exists a second mRNA of 2.7
      kilobases that shares a high degree of homology with about 520 base pairs at the 
      3' end of the cDNA for MLCK.

TI  - Construction and characterization of an active factor VIII variant lacking the
      central one-third of the molecule.
PG  - 8343-7
AB  - The primary structure of factor VIII consists of 2332 amino acids that exhibit 3 
      distinct structural domains, including a triplicated region (A domains), a unique
      region of 909 amino acids (B domain), and a carboxy-terminal duplicated region (C
      domains), that are arranged in the order A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. The B domain (residues
      741-1648) of factor VIII is lost when factor VIII is activated by thrombin, which
      proteolytically processes factor VIII to active subunits of Mr 50,000 (domain
      A1), 43,000 (domain A2), and 73,000 (domains A3-C1-C2). To determine if the B
      domain is required for factor VIII coagulant activity, a variant was constructed 
      by using recombinant DNA techniques in which residues 797-1562 were eliminated.
      This shortened the B domain from 909 to 142 amino acids. This variant factor
      VIIIdes-797-1652 was expressed in mammalian cells and was found to be functional.
      The factor VIIIdes-797-1562 protein was purified and shown to be processed by
      thrombin in the same manner as full-length factor VIII. The factor
      VIIIdes-797-1562 variant also bound to von Willebrand factor (vWF) immobilized on
      Sepharose. These results indicate that most of the highly glycosylated B domain
      of factor VIII is not required for the expression of factor VIII coagulant
      activity and its interaction with vWF.

PG  - 986-92
AB  - The catabolism of naphthalene and salicylate is specified by two operons on an 80
      Kb metabolic plasmid, NAH7. These operons, nah and sal, are carried on the
      contiguous 30 Kb EcoRI-A, C fragments, and are under positive control of a
      regulator region, nahR. Five Nah Sal Tn5 insertion mutants form two
      complementation groups: A = nahR203, nahR204; and B = nahR201, nahR202, nahR205. 
      The physical and genetic maps assign the nahR location to the 15.7-17.2 Kb region
      of the EcoRI-A fragment, with suggestion of more than one control gene.

PG  - 968-72
AB  - Bovine lung angiotensin-converting enzyme was isolated in pure form and the
      sequence of the first twenty-two NH2-terminal amino acids determined.
      Oligonucleotides, complementary to a selected portion of the NH2-terminal amino
      acid sequence of the bovine glycoprotein (Mr 145,000), were synthesized and used 
      for hybridization selection of angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNA. The
      hybridization-selected mRNA programmed the in vitro synthesis of a single
      polypeptide (Mr 130,000) that was specifically immunoadsorbed by anti-bovine
      enzyme antibodies. Preliminary sequence analysis of the primary translation
      product suggests that bovine angiotensin-converting enzyme is synthesized without
      a transient NH2-terminal signal sequence.

TI  - Synthesis in yeast of hepatitis B virus surface antigen modified P31 particles by
      gene modification.
PG  - 942-8
AB  - The pre-S2 portion of hepatitis B virus surface antigen P31 gene was modified to 
      make gene products resistant to trypsin-like proteases in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae. The coding sequence for 6 amino acids (Ser44 - Thr49) including Arg48
      was removed, and the altered gene was inserted into an expression vector. The
      modified HBsAg P31 (M-P31c) gene products, consisting of GP37 and GP34, formed
      particles having both HBsAg antigenicity and polymerized-albumin receptor
      activity. Since the M-P31c particles can elicite two kinds of protective
      antibodies against hepatitis B virus, anti-S and anti-pre-S2 antibodies, the
      M-P31c particles are expected to be potentially effective to S-nonresponders.

TI  - Anomer specificity of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucokinase.
PG  - 931-6
AB  - The anomeric form of glucose produced by glucose-6-phosphatase was studied using 
      an apparatus that specifically measures beta-D-glucose. The time course of
      beta-D-glucose formation from glucose-6-P by glucose-6-phosphatase is essentially
      linear. In the presence of mutarotase, this rate is reduced to 70% of that
      obtained in the absence of mutarotase. When detergent treated microsomes were
      used, the rate of beta-D-glucose formation is unaffected by mutarotase. These
      results suggest that only beta-anomer of glucose is produced by microsomal
      glucose-6-phosphatase and this specificity is determined by translocase for
      glucose-6-P or glucose. It was also demonstrated that alpha-D-glucose is the
      substrate for glucokinase.

TI  - Expression of IL-1 genes in human and bovine chondrocytes: a mechanism for
      autocrine control of cartilage matrix degradation.
PG  - 904-11
AB  - In this report we describe the presence of interleukin-1 activity in medium
      conditioned by bovine articular cartilage. Preparations partially purified by
      Sephacryl S200 chromatography (Mr 18000-25000) stimulate murine thymocyte
      proliferation in the lymphocyte activation factor assay. Furthermore, the
      factor(s) activate cartilage tissue to secrete a protease which is essential for 
      the activity of purified synovial collagenase. We also demonstrate the presence
      of mRNA coding for IL-1 alpha and beta in human articular chondrocytes and
      conclude that the human monocytic and chondrocytic mRNAs are identical. Our
      results demonstrating cartilage expression of IL-1 genes suggest the possibility 
      of an autocrine mechanism whereby chondrocyte production of matrix degrading
      proteases is initiated by chondrocyte derived IL-1.

TI  - Acute effects of alpha-MSH on the rat zona glomerulosa in vivo.
PG  - 1279-84
AB  - alpha-MSH acutely enhanced the plasma concentration of aldosterone (but not that 
      of corticosterone) in the rat, with a maximal response at a dose of 100
      micrograms/kg. This dose of alpha-MSH increased the blood level o aldosterone and
      the activity of 11 beta-hydroxylase and 18-hydroxylase of capsular adrenals in
      rats infused for 24 h with dexamethasone, dexamethasone plus ACTH, or captopril
      plus angiotensin II, but not in animals treated with captopril alone. The plasma 
      concentration of corticosterone and the activity of 11 beta-hydroxylase in the
      inner adrenal layers were not changed. These findings indicate that alpha-MSH is 
      specifically involved in the acute stimulation of the late steps of the secretory
      activity of the rat zona glomerulosa, and that this action of alpha-MSH requires 
      a normal level of circulating angiotensin II.

TI  - Differences in phospholipid incorporation of 32P relevant to alpha 1-receptor
      coupling events in rat and rabbit aorta.
PG  - 1213-21
AB  - Labelling of membrane phospholipids with 32P was compared in rat and rabbit aorta
      under basal conditions and during alpha 1-receptor stimulation. Incorporation of 
      32P proceeded at a significantly higher rate in rat tissue. The ratio of basal
      labelling following 30 min of incubation for rat/rabbit arteries was 4.8 for
      phosphatidylinositol diphosphate (PIP2), 6.0 for phosphatidylinositol phosphate
      (PIP), 9.0 for phosphatidylinositol (PI), 6.0 for phosphatidic acid (PA) and 18.7
      for phosphatidylcholine (PC). Addition of 10(-5)M norepinephrine (NE) to labelled
      tissues resulted in a similar decrease in [32P]-PIP2 in both rat and rabbit
      tissues. Greater percent increases were seen in rabbit tissue of [32P]-PA (4-6
      fold), and [32P]-PI (3-5 fold), when measured over the initial 10 minutes of
      agonist exposure. While NE caused a gradual increase of 32P incorporation into PC
      in rabbit aorta, reaching 180% above control after 10 minutes, PC labelling was
      not increased in rat aorta. Our findings provide evidence for the enhanced
      labelling of rat vs rabbit aorta phospholipids. This may account for differences 
      in receptor responses and associated Ca+ movements which have been previously
      recognized to exist between aorta of these two species.

TI  - Beta-1,3-glucan receptor and peptidoglycan receptor are present as separate
      entities within insect prophenoloxidase activating system.
PG  - 1177-84
AB  - Silkworm plasma was passed over a peptidoglycan-Sepharose 4B column or a CPB
      column [CPB, curdlan type polysaccharide (beta-1,3-glucan) bead] in the absence
      of divalent cation and the effluents from the columns were named plasma-PG and
      plasma-CPB, respectively. Prophenoloxidase activating system in plasma-PG was
      triggered by beta-1,3-glucan but not by peptidoglycan and the system in
      plasma-CPB was triggered by peptidoglycan but not by beta-1,3-glucan, suggesting 
      that the peptidoglycan-Sepharose 4B column and the CPB column remove
      peptidoglycan-receptor and beta-1,3-glucan-receptor, respectively, from plasma.
      This result indicates that both receptors exist as separate entities in silkworm 
      plasma. It is suggested that plasma-PG and plasma-CPB may be used as specific
      reagents to detect minute amounts of beta-1,3-glucan and peptidoglycan.

PG  - 1145-50
AB  - Fractionation of yeast mitochondria by controlled hypotonic treatment revealed
      that the enzyme for heme attachment to apocytochrome c was localized in
      mitochondrial inner membrane. Trypsin digestion of mitoplasts resulted in a
      considerable loss of enzymatic activity, whereas the enzyme in intact
      mitochondria resisted the digestion. Triton X-100 solubilized the enzyme from the
      membrane but high concentration of salt did not. These results reveal that the
      enzyme for heme attachment is localized in mitochondrial inner membrane facing
      the cytoplasmic surface.

TI  - Hydroperoxide-induced radical production in liver mitochondria.
PG  - 1123-9
AB  - When isolated rat liver mitochondria are treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide in
      the presence of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, a six-line ESR
      signal is observed with parameters characteristic of a carbon-centered radical.
      The radical is shown to be CH3. using 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane as the spin trap.
      Inhibition of radical production by EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide provides evidence
      for participation by metals and reduced sulfhydryl groups in the
      radical-generating reaction. It is proposed that radicals are formed through the 
      reaction between a reducing agent, a metal and the hydroperoxide.

TI  - Identification of calmodulin activity in purified retroviruses.
PG  - 1077-83
AB  - Several viruses have been shown to require calcium for their function, and to
      bind calcium at specific sites. However, the nature of the calcium binding
      molecule on viruses has not been established. One possibility is the ubiquitous
      calcium-binding protein calmodulin. Our studies were designed to determine
      whether feline leukemia virus contained calmodulin. Accordingly, we tested
      purified feline leukemia virus for the presence of calmodulin-like activity. The 
      virus, like authentic calmodulin, activated cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. The
      ability of the virus to activate the enzyme was blocked in the presence of the
      known calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine and W-7. This indirect evidence for
      the presence of calmodulin was confirmed by radioimmunoassay. Several other
      retroviruses were also tested using radioimmunoassay and found to contain
      calmodulin. Our results indicate that the calcium binding site in retroviruses
      may be calmodulin.

TI  - Multiple molecular forms of interferon display different specific activities in
      the induction of the antiviral state and 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase.
PG  - 1042-50
AB  - Both Hu IFN-alpha A and Hu IFN-alpha D, produced by two independent recombinant
      bacterial clones, are mixtures of monomers, dimers and trimers. These forms, when
      assayed individually in heterologous MDBK cells, induced different degree of
      antiviral and 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5' A synthetase) activities: the 
      antiviral activity of the monomer is greater than that of the dimer and the
      trimer, whereas the activity of 2'5' A synthetase induction is lower with the
      monomer than with the dimer or the trimer. Similar differences are also observed 
      on human cells. Compared to the mononeric form, the dimeric and the trimeric
      forms of Hu IFN-alpha A show higher antiviral inducing activity on heterologous
      MDBK cells than on homologous WISH cells, whereas the 2'5' A synthetase inducing 
      activity in these two cell lines is about the same. Thus for the same antiviral
      activity, the trimer or the dimer compared to the monomer are much better
      inducers of the 2'5' A synthetase on human than on MDBK cells.

TI  - Low-spin sulfite reductases: a new homologous group of non-heme iron-siroheme
      proteins in anaerobic bacteria.
PG  - 1032-41
AB  - Two new low molecular weight proteins with sulfite reductase activity, isolated
      from Methanosarcina barkeri (DSM 800) and Desulfuromonas acetoxidans (strain
      5071), were studied by EPR and optical spectroscopic techniques. Both proteins
      have visible spectra similar to that of the low-spin sulfite reductase of
      Desulfovibrio vulgaris strain Hildenborough and no band at 715 nm, characteristic
      of high-spin Fe3+ complexes in isobacteriochlorins is observed. EPR shows that as
      isolated the siroheme is in a low-spin ferric state (S = 1/2) with g-values at
      2.40, 2.30 and 1.88 for the Methanosarcina barkeri enzyme and g-values at 2.44,
      2.33 and 1.81 for the Desulfuromonas acetoxidans enzyme. Chemical analysis shows 
      that both proteins contain one siroheme and one [Fe4S4] center per polypeptidic
      chain. These results suggest that the low molecular weight, low-spin non-heme
      iron siroheme proteins represent a new homologous class of sulfite reductases
      common to anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  - Role of pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins in the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor
      but not in the thyrotropin receptor mediated activation of membrane
      phospholipases and iodide fluxes in FRTL-5 thyroid cells.
PG  - 1000-6
AB  - The regulation of thyroid hormone formation by thyrotropin and norepinephrine
      involves the activation of both phospholipases C and A2. When FRTL-5 cells are
      incubated with 10(-10)M pertussis toxin for 4 to 20 h, the stimulation of iodide 
      efflux by norepinephrine is inhibited by 50 to 70%. At the same toxin
      concentration the norepinephrine induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is
      unaffected; however upon 20 h pretreatment with 10(-9)M pertussis toxin a 30%
      inhibition is observed. By contrast, the pertussis toxin treatment had no effect 
      on the increase in iodide efflux or in cytosolic Ca2+ levels induced by
      thyrotropin. Our data suggest that two GTP binding proteins sensitive to
      pertussis toxin are involved in the alpha 1 adrenergic but not in the thyrotropin
      induced activation of the signal transduction mechanisms leading to iodide efflux
      in FRTL-5 cells.

TI  - Beta-endorphin in the human gallbladder.
PG  - 331-8
AB  - The presence of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-END-LI) in human
      gallbladder and its release were examined by means of radioimmunochemical
      measurements and immunohistochemical stainings. beta-END-LI was detected in the
      gallbladder (27.2 +/- 3.2 ng/g wet weight, mean +/- S.E.). The immunoreactivity
      in beta-END-LI extracted from the gallbladder was similar to that of synthetic
      beta-END, judging from the result of its inhibition curve parallel to that of the
      synthetic substance in the radioimmunoassay (RIA) system. On gel-filtration
      chromatography of a gallbladder extract, two components of beta-END-LI were
      found; one eluted on a position of beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) and another on a
      position of synthetic beta-END. Specific beta-END-LI positive cells were
      detectable in metaplastic mucous glands. When human gallbladder mucosa was
      perfused with a solution of 10(-8) M or 10(-6) M cholecystokinin octapeptide
      (CCK-8), the release of beta-END-LI from mucosa into the perfusate increased 2-3 
      fold. These results indicate that beta-END-LI present in human gallbladder is
      released by the direct action of CCK-8 on the gallbladder mucosa and suggest that
      it may have a physiological or pathophysiological role.

PG  - 189-98
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients without neurological disorder was
      analyzed after Sep-Pak extraction for beta-endorphin (beta-EP)-immunoreactive
      components by combined reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay. A C-terminal directed antibody detected one major
      immunoreactive component, probably identical with beta-EP1-31. An N-terminal
      directed antibody detected several immunoreactive components. One co-eluted with 
      beta-EP1-31 but the others are probably C-terminal truncated or otherwise
      modified forms of beta-EP1-31. However, they eluted differently from beta-EP1-16 
      (alpha-endorphin), beta-EP1-26, 1-27 and alpha,N-acetyl-beta-EP1-31.
      Alternatively, some of the fragments may represent C-terminal extended forms of
      pro-enkephalin A-derived Met-enkephalin. A Met-enkephalin antiserum detected
      several immunoreactive components probably representing N-terminal extended
      forms; neither of them were identical with the beta-EP-immunoreactive components.
      The results illustrate the heterogeneity of the beta-EP-immunoreactive components
      in CSF and the need to characterize the beta-EP radioimmunoassay before its
      application to biological extracts.

TI  - A somatostatin receptor negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase in the human
      gastric cell line HGT-1.
PG  - 207-15
AB  - Somatostatin receptors are demonstrated in the human derived gastric cell line
      HGT-1. Using 125I-Tyr11-somatostatin as ligand, two classes of sites were
      characterized with apparent dissociation constants KD1 = 0.9 X 10(-10) M and KD2 
      = 4 X 10(-9) M and maximum binding capacities of N1 = 20 and N2 = 556 fmol per mg
      protein, respectively. These values are close to those previously reported in
      freshly isolated parietal cells (Reyl, F., Silve, C. and Lewin, M.J.M.,
      Somatostatin receptors on isolated gastric cells. In S. Bonfils et al. (Eds.),
      Hormone Receptors in Digestion and Nutrition, Elsevier/North-Holland, Amsterdam, 
      1979, pp. 391-400). Somatostatin binding to the high affinity sites was partially
      inhibited by the non-hydrolysable guanyl nucleotide analog Gpp(NH)p and by
      pretreating the cells with islet activating protein (IAP). Furthermore, IAP
      counteracted the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on histamine stimulation of
      adenylate cyclase. These findings are interpreted in terms of somatostatin
      interaction with the 41,000 Da adenylate cyclase GTP-dependent inhibitory
      subunit, Ni.

PG  - 956-62
AB  - The development of simultaneous resistance to multiple drugs in cultured cells
      occurs after selection for resistance to single agents. This multidrug-resistance
      phenotype is thought to mimic multidrug-resistance in human tumors treated with
      chemotherapy. Both the expression of a membrane protein, termed P170 or
      P-glycoprotein, and the expression of a cloned DNA fragment, termed mdr1, have
      been shown independently to be associated with multidrug-resistance in cultured
      cells. In this work, we show that human KB carcinoma cells which express the mdr1
      gene also express P-glycoprotein, and that cDNAs encoding P-glycoprotein
      cross-hybridize with mdr1 cDNAs. Thus, the mdr1 gene codes for P-glycoprotein.

PG  - 1222-8
AB  - The biosynthesis of a porcine kidney peroxisomal enzyme, D-amino acid oxidase (EC
      1.4.3.3., DAO), was investigated. Pig kidney mRNA as well as free and
      membrane-bound polysomes were used to investigate in vitro protein synthesis
      using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. mRNA and free polysomes, but not
      membrane-bound polysomes, directed the synthesis of DAO. To examine the in vivo
      synthesis of the enzyme, a pig kidney cell line (LLC-PK1) was biosynthetically
      labelled. Both the in vitro and in vivo synthesized DAO had the same molecular
      weight, 38,000, as that of the purified enzyme. These results indicate strongly
      that DAO is synthesized on free ribosomes and transferred to the interior of
      peroxisomes without any proteolytic modification.

TI  - Changes in the plasma membrane ATPase activity in relationship to cell
      proliferation in Dictyostelium.
PG  - 1092-8
AB  - The plasma membrane ATPase activity of Dictyostelium amoebae increases ca 2.5
      fold from non dividing stationary phase cells to synchronously growing cells.
      This increase in ATPase activity takes place during the three hours lag period
      that precede the cell division after diluting stationary cells into fresh medium 
      and is prevented by cycloheximide. No differences in the Km for ATP or in the
      optimal pH for activity were observed in kinetic studies carried out with
      purified plasma membranes from stationary and proliferating cells.

      mice.
PG  - 339-48
AB  - The concentrations and contents of immunoreactive substance P (SP), neurokinin A 
      (NKA), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and gastrin releasing peptide
      (GRP) were measured in acid-ethanol extracts of intestine
      (duodenum-jejunum-ileum) and pancreas of C57BL/KsJ diabetes-obese (db/db) mice,
      Aston obese-hyperglycaemic (ob/ob) mice, and their respective lean controls. The 
      intestinal concentration of GRP and pancreatic concentrations of VIP and GRP were
      36-57% lower in lean Aston mice than lean C57BL/KsJ mice, indicating the
      influence of genetic background in control mice. Intestinal concentrations of SP 
      and NKA were reduced by 19-33% in the db/db and ob/ob mutants compared with their
      lean controls, but the intestinal contents of these peptides were normal or
      greater than normal due to intestinal hypertrophy of the mutant mice. The
      intestinal VIP concentration was not altered, but the content was increased by
      87% and 25% respectively in db/db and ob/ob mice, whereas the intestinal GRP
      concentration was reduced by 51% in ob/ob mice. Pancreatic concentrations and
      contents of NKA, VIP and GRP were similar in lean and db/db C57BL/KsJ mice.
      However, pancreatic concentrations and contents of VIP and GRP were reduced by
      51-55% in ob/ob mice compared with their lean controls. The sensitivity of the
      present assay did not permit accurate determination of the low pancreatic
      concentrations of SP. The results suggest that the spontaneous ob/ob and db/db
      syndromes of obesity and diabetes in mice are associated with reduced intestinal 
      concentrations of SP and NKA. The ob/ob mouse also exhibited reductions of
      intestinal GRP and pancreatic GRP and VIP concentrations. These changes in
      regulatory peptides may relate to abnormalities of intestinal and possibly
      pancreatic function in obese and diabetic mutant mice.

      effect of dibutyryl 3':5'-cyclic AMP and reserpine.
PG  - 251-9
AB  - The carboxy terminal part of the proenkephalin A sequence is the 31 amino acid
      peptide B, which has as its final seven amino acids the sequence of the opioid
      peptide Met-enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7. Using a radioimmunoassay which recognises both 
      these peptides we have investigated the relative amounts of peptide B and
      Met-enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7 in a human neuroblastoma cell line. We show that these
      cells contain peptide B-like immunoreactivity but not its heptapeptide fragment. 
      This may be due to lack of proteolytic activity cleaving Met-enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7
      from its precursor, peptide B. On treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP the level
      of immunoreactivity approximately doubles, due to increased amounts of peptide
      B-like immunoreactivity. Treatment with reserpine, which increases conversion of 
      peptide B to the heptapeptide in bovine chromaffin cells in culture does not
      stimulate the accumulation of Met-enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7 in the human neuroblastoma
      cells. The results are discussed with respect to peptide processing.

PG  - 8368-72
AB  - Evaluation of the free energy of ionization of acidic groups in proteins may be
      used as a powerful and general test case for determining the reliability of
      calculations of electrostatic energies in macromolecules. This work attacks this 
      test case by using an adiabatic charging process that evaluates the changes in
      free energies associated with ionizing the acidic groups Asp-3 and Glu-7 in
      bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and aspartic acid in solution. The results of
      these free energy calculations are very encouraging; the error range is about 1
      kcal/mol for these free energy changes of about-70 kcal/mol. This indicates that 
      we are finally approaching the stage of obtaining quantitative results in
      modeling the energetics of solvated proteins.

TI  - Intestinal basolateral membrane Ca-ATPase activity with properties distinct from 
      those of the Ca-pump.
PG  - 979-85
AB  - The Ca-pump in rat intestinal basolateral membranes had been studied previously
      as vesicular ATP-dependent Ca-uptake. In the present studies, Ca-stimulated ATP
      hydrolysis (Ca-ATPase activity) was measured and found to differ from the Ca-pump
      in having higher activity and being insensitive to vanadate. Whereas the pump was
      specific for ATP, hydrolytic activity was found with ATP, GTP or ADP but not with
      AMP or p-nitro-phenyl-phosphate. In contrast to Ca-pump activity, Ca-ATPase
      activities were similar for different intestinal segments, for duodenal
      villus/crypt cell-fractions and for vitamin D-deficient animals. Thus, as usually
      measured, intestinal basolateral membrane Ca-ATPase activity is not equivalent to
      the Ca-pump.

PG  - 949-55
AB  - The clearance of the rat acute-phase proteins alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha
      1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein with no, high-mannose,
      hybrid or complex type oligosaccharide side chains was determined in the isolated
      perfused rat liver. The differently glycosylated forms of the three proteins were
      obtained from rat hepatocyte primary cultures treated with different inhibitors
      of glycosylation. The complex type forms of the three proteins were essentially
      not cleared by the liver during 2 h of perfusion. Unglycosylated alpha
      2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein decreased in the perfusate by about
      50% after 2 h; unglycosylated alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was not taken up by
      the liver. The high-mannose type forms of the three proteins were nearly totally 
      cleared. After 2 h of perfusion 10%, 45% and 30% of the hybrid type forms of
      alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha 1-acid
      glycoprotein, respectively, were cleared. The clearance rates of high-mannose and
      of hybrid type glycoproteins could be reduced to the rates of complex type
      glycoproteins by the addition of mannan to the perfusate. It is concluded that
      complex type glycosylation prevents the uptake of plasma glycoproteins by the
      liver.

PG  - 924-30
AB  - We and others have previously demonstrated expression of the co-fms
      proto-oncogene during human monocytic differentiation. The c-fms gene has since
      been shown to encode for the macrophage specific colony stimulating factor
      (CSF-1) receptor. The present results demonstrate that both CSF-1 and c-fms
      transcripts are induced during monocytic differentiation of human HL-60 leukemia 
      cells. The results further demonstrate that normal human monocytes express CSF-1 
      RNA and that the level of these transcripts increases upon treatment with phorbol
      ester. Finally, the detection of CSF-1 RNA in HL-60 cells and in monocytes is
      associated with production of the CSF-1 gene product. These findings would
      suggest that monocytes are capable of regulating their own survival, growth and
      differentiation through CSF-1 production.

AB  - Potassium ion currents through bilayer lipid membranes were modified by the
      membrane-surface reaction of concanavalin A and the polysaccharides dextran and
      glycogen. Aggregative reaction with glycogen occasionally induced spontaneous
      periodic ion current fluctuations with cycle times of minutes and durations of
      over one hour. Different electrochemical characteristics were observed between
      large planar lipid membranes and filter paper supported membranes, providing an
      indication that the aqueous unstirred surface layer participates in the control
      of the surface aggregative event. Lipid chemical composition was implicated in
      the development of spontaneous oscillations.

PG  - 1261-6
AB  - Thyroglobulin gene control by cAMP and thyrotropin has been compared in FRTL-5
      thyroid cells maintained in the absence of serum, insulin, cortisol, and
      thyrotropin for 7 days. Readdition of thyrotropin induces an increase in the
      expression of the thyroglobulin gene with little effect on total RNA synthesis.
      In contrast, addition of 8-bromo cyclic AMP and cholera toxin stimulate total RNA
      synthesis as well as thyroglobulin gene expression. The same non-selective effect
      of cyclic AMP on the thyroglobulin gene was observed when transcriptional
      activity was measured in permeabilized FRTL-5 cells.

TI  - Renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidases: influence of glycosylation on the
      electrophoretic behavior and molecular weights of their subunits.
PG  - 1189-94
AB  - The molecular weights (Mr) of mammalian renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase light
      subunits vary from 21 to 25 K; a much broader range is seen for the large subunit
      (51 to 72 K). However, chemical deglycosylation of these enzymes (rat, human, and
      bovine) yields subunits each of which exhibits identical Mr (41 and 19 K for the 
      heavy and light subunits, respectively), suggesting strong similarity between the
      peptide backbones of these glycoproteins. Immunological data also indicate
      homologies between these enzymes. The difference observed in the Mr of native
      subunits thus seem to be related to the extent and nature of glycosylation of
      these proteins.

TI  - The antilipolytic effect of insulin in human adipocytes requires activation of
      the phosphodiesterase.
PG  - 1157-61
AB  - Human fat cells were incubated with two different cAMP analogues, 8-bromocAMP and
      6N-monobutyrylcAMP. The former analogue is an excellent substrate for the
      phosphodiesterase while the latter is resistant to hydrolysis. In the presence of
      adenosine deaminase, isoproterenol (10(-6)M) stimulated lipolysis 8-10 fold which
      was similar to the effect exerted by the cAMP analogues. Basal lipolysis and
      lipolysis activated by 6N-monobutyrylcAMP was not inhibited by insulin even at
      high concentrations, whereas the effect of 8-bromocAMP was virtually completely
      inhibited. This effect of insulin was completely prevented by the addition of
      IBMX. Thus, activation of phosphodiesterase by insulin is necessary to elicit the
      antilipolytic effect in human adipocytes.

PG  - 1109-15
AB  - Two genomic DNA clones encoding part of the mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF)
      receptor were isolated: an 8.0 kb insert that hybridized with the human EGF
      receptor kinase domain; and a 2.4 kb insert that mapped between the kinase and 3'
      autophosphorylation domains of the human EGF receptor gene. The 2.4 kb insert was
      further digested to a 2.0 kb fragment and a 0.4 kb fragment containing 49
      residues that were almost identical to the corresponding human EGF receptor
      sequence. Ribonuclease protection studies with mouse RNA identified three exons
      of 170 kb, 105 kb, and 50 kb in the 2.0 kb probe that were less homologous to the
      corresponding human or rat mRNAs. Northern blot hybridizations identified two EGF
      receptor transcripts of 10 kb and 6 kb in normal, but not EGF-nonresponsive,
      mouse cell lines, and a single 9.5 kb transcript in rat cells. An additional 6.5 
      kb transcript from rat NRK cells was identified that is related to but not
      transcribed from the EGF receptor gene.

PG  - 1058-65
AB  - The high sensitivity analysis of peptides by fast atom bombardment mass
      spectrometry has been achieved using a continuous flow probe for the introduction
      of samples contained in aqueous solutions. Small aliquots of sample (0.5-1
      microliter) are injected into a solvent flow containing water/glycerol (8:2). For
      several peptide samples tested whose molecular weights were between 1000 and 1500
      daltons, molecular ions were selectively monitored at the 20 fmol level with a
      signal-to-chemical noise of about 4:1, and full scan data were obtained on about 
      5 pmol of sample. The increase in sensitivity observed using the continuous flow 
      probe is shown to be a consequence of both the decrease in the chemical
      background noise and to the increase in ion yields obtained from the bombardment 
      of aqueous sample solutions.

TI  - A preliminary study of urinary transferrin as a marker for prostatic cancer.
PG  - 335-9
AB  - Traditional serum markers used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer lack
      sensitivity and specificity. Prostatic fluid is in direct contact with the
      prostate epithelium and, thus, has been investigated as a better source for
      potentially useful markers. Since prostatic fluid contents can enter the urine
      directly through the urethra, without prerequisite entry into blood, proteins
      present in significant quantities in prostatic fluid represent candidate markers 
      for entry into the urine, particularly in diseases affecting the prostate
      epithelium, such as adenocarcinoma. High concentrations of transferrin in
      prostatic fluid led us to examine urine transferrin levels, using an
      immunoturbidimetric technique. Urine transferrin was significantly increased in
      18 out of 22 patients with prostate cancer in comparison to age-matched controls.
      Since there was no evidence of increased transferrin excretion, we suggest that
      prostatic fluid is the source of transferrinuria.

      of a tsetse fly.
PG  - 2617-22
AB  - In order to examine the possible effects of ecdysteroids on parturition, we
      studied in vitro the influence of ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone on the motility
      of isolated uterus from virgin and pregnant female tsetse fly (Glossina
      fuscipes). Ecdysone initiates phasic uterine contractions or enhances the
      frequency of preexisting contractile activity. In contrast, uterine contractions 
      are decreased or abolished by 20-hydroxyecdysone. Pharmacological data indicate
      that tsetse fly uterus exhibits myogenic and nerve-evoked contractions.
      Ecdysteroids mainly act on nervous structures that control muscle contractions.
      Our results provide evidence for a specific action of ecdysteroids on a
      nerve-muscle target involved in female reproduction.

      produces (+)-N-allylnormetazocine-like (SKF 10,047) discriminative stimuli.
PG  - 2611-5
AB  - In rats trained to discriminate the prototypic sigma receptor agonist,
      (+)-N-Allylnormetazocine [(+)-N-Allylnormetazocine [(+)-NANM/SKF 10,047], from
      saline, the (+)- but not the (-)-isomer of
      3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine (3-PPP) produced (+)-NANM-like
      discriminative stimuli. (+)-3-PPP binds stereo selectively to the (+)-NANM
      binding site, but not to the phencyclidine binding site. Additionally,
      phencyclidine was found to produce (+)-NANM-like discriminative stimuli. Although
      the 3-PPP isomers were shown to produce changes in central dopaminergic activity 
      (Hjorth et al. Life Sci 37, 673, 1985), the discriminative stimulus properties of
      (+)-3-PPP are apparently not mediated via the dopaminergic system. This
      hypothesis is supported by the fact that apomorphine did not produce
      (+)-NANM-like discriminative stimuli. These stimuli are thus non-dopaminergic and
      may be due to the (+)-3-PPP actions at the sigma binding site. However, it is
      possible that (+)-NANM, PCP, and (+)-3-PPP may have common non-sigma
      pharmacologic properties that account for the similar discriminative stimulus
      properties of these compounds.

TI  - Inhibition of ethanol induced ethane exhalation by carcinogenic pretreatment of
      rats 12 months earlier.
PG  - 2587-91
AB  - The exhalation of ethane was used as a measure of in vivo lipid peroxidation in
      rats treated with the hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine followed by
      2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), and carbon tetrachloride, and subsequently fed a
      liquid diet containing 7% ethanol for 12 months. The other groups consisted of
      animals treated with methylbenzylnitrosamine (MBN), an esophageal carcinogen, or 
      non-carcinogen pretreated animals with or without 7% ethanol feeding. Ethane
      production was increased in rats consuming ethanol irrespective of their
      pretreatment with MBN. In sharp contrast, the ethanol-induced increase of ethane 
      production was absent in rats given the hepatocarcinogenic regime. Our results
      strengthen recent observations indicating decreased susceptibility of tumor cells
      to lipid peroxidation. In addition, they confirm the debated concept that there
      is increased lipid peroxidation following ethanol consumption.

AB  - Serotonin levels and turnover were measured in different brains areas of full
      bulbectomized and partially bulbectomized European hamsters and their controls.
      Full bulbectomized hamsters did not hibernate and ate more than the two other
      groups in which hibernation patterns were similar. The levels of serotonin were
      of the same magnitude in the three groups. The turnover rates were slower in
      amygdala and hypothalamus in the full lesioned animals. These results were
      discussed for their implications in the mechanism of entrance into hibernation.

TI  - Opposite effects of adrenaline and ouabain on the resting potential of rat atrial
      cells.
PG  - 2541-50
AB  - In the left rat atrium changes in diastolic potential (E max) evoked by sudden
      stimulation train were modified by adrenaline and ouabain. The early stimulation 
      depolarization phase (SDP) of E max occurring on stimulation was shortened by
      adrenaline, but lengthened and strongly enhanced by ouabain. The stimulation
      repolarization phase (SRP) following SDP was markedly inhibited by ouabain, while
      accelerated and increased by adrenaline. In continuously stimulated atria E max
      was decreased by ouabain and augmented by adrenaline. The adrenaline-induced
      hyperpolarization was reduced or suppressed in the presence of 10-4 M or 10-3 M
      ouabain, respectively. The present data suggest that adrenaline could stimulate
      the electrogenic sodium pump in the rat atrium.

TI  - Relaxant effect of dopamine on isolated rabbit pulmonary artery.
PG  - 2525-31
AB  - In rabbit pulmonary artery, dopamine (10(-11)-10(-5) M) produced a
      concentration-dependent relaxation of the arterial strips contracted with
      prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) in the presence of prazosin (10(-6) M),
      yohimbine (10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-6) M), and methysergide (10(-6) M).
      SKF38393, an agonist for D1 or DA1 dopamine receptor, mimicked partially the
      concentration-response curve for dopamine, whereas LY171555 and apomorphine did
      not. The order of potency of dopamine antagonists on the inhibitory effect was:
      cis-flupenthixol greater than bulbo-capnine greater than metoclopramide greater
      than haloperidol. Sulpiride was inactive. Cis-flupenthixol did not block the
      relaxation induced by acetylcholine, adenosine, and papaverine. In the arterial
      strips of the rabbits pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine, the
      concentration-response curve for dopamine was similar to that in non-treated
      rabbits. Thus it is concluded that a specific dopamine receptor is located on the
      postsynaptic muscle membrane of the rabbit pulmonary artery.

TI  - Evidence for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) biosynthesis in rat prostate.
PG  - 2565-70
AB  - TRH occurs in very high concentration in rat prostate. A species specific protein
      with repetitive -Gln-His-Pro-Gly- sequences, which are flanked on the N- and
      C-terminus by paired basic residues, has been shown to be the source of TRH in
      frog skin and rat hypothalamus. Following cleavage by trypsin-like enzymes, the
      peptide fragments with N-terminal Gln spontaneously cyclize to pGlu while Gly
      within the C-terminally extended peptides serves as the -NH2 donor for the
      alpha-amidation of the proline residue. Because this last step in the
      biosynthesis of TRH is rate limiting for pGlu-His-Pro-Gly, we have combined
      several chromatographic and radioimmunoassay techniques to identify this TRH
      precursor in rat prostate.

TI  - Selective proliferation of brain kappa opiate receptors in spontaneously
      hypertensive rats.
PG  - 2593-600
AB  - The binding of tritiated ligands for various opiate receptor subtypes to brain
      membranes prepared from spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive
      Wistar-Kyoto rats was determined. The density (Bmax) or the apparent dissociation
      constant (Kd) for the binding of the mu-ligand (naltrexone) and delta-ligand
      (Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr) to brain membranes of hypertensive and normotensive
      rats did not differ. However, the Bmax for the binding of kappa-ligand
      (ethylketocyclazocine, EKC) to brain membranes after the suppression of mu and
      delta-sites by 100 nM each of unlabeled D-Ala2-MePhe4-Gly-ol5-enkephalin and
      D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin, respectively, was significantly greater in hypertensive
      rats compared to normotensive rats. The Kd values for the binding of 3H-EKC in
      the two groups did not differ. The binding of 3H-EKC in brain regions was in the 
      order: hypothalamus greater than midbrain greater than striatum greater than
      cortex greater than pons + medulla. The increase in the binding of 3H-EKC in the 
      brain of hypertensive rats compared to normotensive rats was due to increased
      binding in the hypothalamus and cortex. These results provide for the first time 
      evidence of selective proliferation of kappa-opiate receptors in the brain of
      hypertensive rats, and suggest that brain kappa-opiate receptors may play an
      important role in the pathophysiology of hypertension.

TI  - Dissociation between plasma and atrial content of atrial natriuretic polypeptide 
      (ANP) following sodium load in rats.
PG  - 2623-7
AB  - To investigate the time course effect of sodium intake on release and synthesis
      of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP), plasma and atrial content of ANP were
      measured in rats which had been fed either a high or a low salt diet for 1, 3, 7,
      14 and 35 days. Plasma ANP in rats fed the high salt diet for one day was
      significantly higher than in those fed the low salt diet. However, there were no 
      significant differences between the groups fed either the high or the low salt
      diet for 3 days or more. In contrast to the direction of change in plasma ANP,
      atrial content of ANP in rats fed the high salt diet for one day tended to be
      lower and was significantly lower in those fed for 3 and 7 days than in the low
      salt diet group, while there were no significant differences between both groups 
      that were fed for 14 and 35 days. These results suggest that ANP is rapidly
      released into the circulation when sodium is loaded, however, the atrial storage 
      of ANP remains depleted for about one week.

TI  - Specific regional differences of in vitro beta-endorphin metabolism in
      schizophrenics.
PG  - 2601-9
AB  - Incubation of beta-endorphin (beta-E; 25 microM) with twice-washed brain membrane
      homogenates leads to the formation of several biologically active peptide
      fragments which have been shown to be present in the brain. Based on clinical
      studies, some of these endorphin fragments have been shown to be active in
      patients with neuropsychiatric disease states. We studied the regional
      specificity of beta-E metabolism in frontal cortex versus putamen from sex and
      age matched controls versus subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The
      present study demonstrates that cortical tissue has a lower rate of
      gamma-endorphin production from beta-E and a similar rate of
      des-tyrosine-gamma-endorphin production. Significant differences were noted in
      the production of other active fragments (beta-E (1-16, 2-16, 6-21)). These
      results support the hypothesis that there is a regional specificity of beta-E
      metabolism in the brain, and these differences may have important functional
      consequences to secreted peptides and important clinical consequences in
      schizophrenia.

TI  - In vivo potencies of antipsychotic drugs in blocking alpha 1 noradrenergic and
      dopamine D2 receptors: implications for drug mechanisms of action.
PG  - 2571-80
AB  - In addition to being dopamine antagonists, all antipsychotic drugs are potent
      antagonists of alpha-1 noradrenergic receptors. Nevertheless, the contribution of
      alpha blockade to the clinical therapeutic effects of the antipsychotic drugs has
      never attracted extensive study. In particular, the relative alpha-1
      noradrenergic antagonist potency of antipsychotic drugs has rarely been
      determined in vivo during extended treatment, although such treatment would
      provide a better model of clinical drug effects than the determination of
      potencies in in vitro systems, such as assays of competition for binding sites in
      tissue homogenates, as is most often done. To estimate the physiological efficacy
      of antipsychotic drugs as dopamine and alpha adrenergic antagonists, we treated
      rats for four weeks with daily IP injections of the following antipsychotic
      drugs: Fluphenazine, 1 mg/kg; haloperidol, 1 mg/kg; chlorpromazine, 25 mg/kg;
      thioridazine, 25 mg/kg; and clozapine, 25 mg/kg. Effective antagonism should lead
      to an increase in density of the relevant receptors. After two drug-free days,
      rats were sacrificed and the affinity and density of dopamine D2 and alpha-1
      noradrenergic receptors were determined in striatum and brain exclusive of
      striatum, respectively. Alpha 1 noradrenergic receptor density but not dopamine
      receptor density was increased after all treatments. Thus, preliminary
      experiments with this in vivo model suggest that all antipsychotic drugs are
      effective antagonists at alpha 1 noradrenergic receptors, while not all are
      effective antagonists at dopamine D2 receptors.

TI  - A small, removable microdialysis probe.
PG  - 2629-37
AB  - A miniaturized, concentric, microdialysis probe is described. It is constructed
      from 36 gauge stainless steel tubing inside of 26 gauge tubing, with a cellulose 
      hollow fiber tip 0.2 mm in diameter and 2 mm long. It has a 6000 molecular weight
      cut off that excludes enzymes but collects monoamines, their metabolites, and
      other small neurochemicals. In vitro tests show relative recovery rates of 5-10%.
      Absolute recovery measured in picograms was independent of the perfusate flow
      rate inside the probe. Tests in awake rats with probes in the nucleus accumbens
      showed stable amounts of catecholamines and metabolites collected during repeated
      20 min samples. After ip amphetamine, release of dopamine in the accumbens
      increased from 20 to 40 pg per sample while DOPAC and HVA decreased from about
      1500 to 500 pg. Tests of multiple site sampling succeeded in obtaining
      norepinephrine and dopamine plus three metabolites (DOPAC, HVA and 5HIAA) from
      four probes simultaneously in four different brain sites in each rat. Five day
      continuous samples or monthly intermittent samples can be obtained with this
      microdialysis probe.

TI  - Effect of continuous infusions of dexfenfluramine on food intake, body weight and
      brain amines in rats.
PG  - 2581-6
AB  - The present experiments describe the effects of continuous SC infusion, via
      osmotic minipump, of dexfenfluramine on food intake and body weight of male and
      female rats. It was found that the food intake of male rats was reduced by
      infusions of both 3 and 6 mg/kg/day although tolerance developed within 2-4 days 
      at the lower dose. Further, these rats showed tolerance to an acute anorectic
      test dose of dexfenfluramine. Body weight loss was sustained by both groups. In
      older (6-8 mo old) female rats, some of which had previously nursed three
      litters, the anorectic effects of dexfenfluramine (3 and 6 mg/kg/day) were
      sustained throughout the 6 day infusion, and weight loss was substantial. The
      effects did not differ between bred and virgin rats of comparable age. The lower 
      dose of dexfenfluramine produced no depletion of brain serotonin (5HT), although 
      5HIAA was reduced. Both compounds were depleted by the higher dose. The 3
      mg/kg/day dose, in select rat populations, may be a close model for the mode of
      dexfenfluramine administration to humans.

TI  - Inhibition by vanadate of cyclic AMP production in rat corpora lutea incubated in
      vitro.
PG  - 2557-64
AB  - Vanadate, a normal constituent of cells, has been reported to affect a variety of
      enzymes involved in phosphate transfer; the findings regarding adenylate cycle
      vary with the tissue and experimental system. In the corpus luteum, cyclic AMP
      (cAMP) stimulates steroidogenesis; and prostaglandin F2 alpha, which induces
      luteal regression, inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH)-induced cAMP accumulation.
      We examined the influence of orthovanadate on cAMP concentration in isolated
      corpora lutea from pseudopregnant rats. With 2 mM vanadate, basal cAMP level was 
      unaffected, but LH-induced cAMP accumulation was inhibited by 45-68%. Lower doses
      of vanadate (0.2-1 mM) were almost as effective. When added simultaneously with
      LH, vanadate was inhibitory within 25 min, but no inhibition occurred when
      vanadate was added for 30 min to tissue pretreated with LH for 60 min. The
      decrease in cAMP accumulation was observed also when corpora lutea were exposed
      to vanadate in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
      3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mM), indicating that vanadate inhibits cAMP
      synthesis. Vanadate may increase cytosolic calcium by inhibiting ion pumps in
      cell membranes. Thus, we examined the effect of vanadate in corpora lutea
      incubated in calcium-depleted medium and found that vanadate still inhibited cAMP
      formation. Vanadyl sulfate (0.4 and 2 mM) reduced the LH-induced cAMP
      accumulation as effectively as vanadate. Thus, the use of vanadate as a tool for 
      exploring physiological regulators of luteal adenylate cyclase should be
      considered.

TI  - A novel bioassay for the NK-2 neurokinin receptor: the guinea pig gallbladder.
PG  - 2533-9
AB  - Although three neurokinin receptors (NK-1, NK-2, NK-3) have been identified by
      radioligand binding assays, only the NK-1 and NK-3 types have been found in
      smooth muscle bioassays. In this study, evidence is presented demonstrating
      functional NK-2 type receptors in the guinea pig gallbladder (GPGB). The
      potencies of the following neurokinins were determined in the GPGB and the guinea
      pig ileum (GPI): substance P (SP), physalaemin (PH), eledoisin (EL), substance K 
      (SK) and kassinin (KA). ED50 values were determined by linear regression analysis
      of the dose-related increases in the force generated by each peptide. In the GPI,
      the rank order of potency was SP = PH = EL greater than SK = KA, indicating NK-1 
      selectivity. In the GPGB, the relative potencies were SK greater than KA greater 
      than EL much greater than PH greater than SP, which is similar to that reported
      for the NK-2 receptor in radioligand binding assays. These findings demonstrate
      the NK-2 receptor tissue selectivity of the GPGB.

TI  - [Resistance patterns in Shigella].
PG  - 1848-51
AB  - Diarrhea is the most common health problem in travelers to tropical countries.
      Shigellae are not the primary cause but often provoke clinically relevant
      diseases that call for treatment. Therefore, we have analyzed resistance patterns
      in all Shigella strains isolated at this department over 1 1/2 years. Of 107
      isolates 77% were resistant to tetracycline, 33% to
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 31% to ampicillin, and only 2% to nalidixic acid. 
      Differences in resistance patterns for isolates of different geographical origins
      were marginal. The small number of strains resistant to nalidixic acid (2/107)
      suggests that agents inhibiting DNA gyrase may be useful for self-administered
      treatment during travel as well as upon return. Controlled clinical trials,
      however, are still lacking.

TI  - [Significance of reciprocal ST-segment depression in the acute stage of
      transmural myocardial infarct].
PG  - 1840-7
AB  - 19 patients with transitory ST-segment depression in the wall opposite the
      infarcted territory during acute transmural myocardial infarction (AMI) were
      studied. We investigated the reproducibility of this reciprocal ST depression
      induced by stress testing and correlated the ECG changes with coronary
      angiographic evaluation of arteries supplying the remote area. We tried to derive
      criteria for detection of simple mirror image. 3 different groups were defined
      according to ECG evolution: Group 1 consisted of 7 anterior and 3 inferior AMI
      where reciprocal ECG changes disappeared appeared within 24 to 48 hours
      independently of the ECG changes in the infarcted area. These ST depressions were
      reproduced by stress testing one to two months later, and correlated
      angiographically with an anatomic lesion. 7 out of 10 patients later had bypass
      graft surgery. Group 2 consisted of 7 patients in whom posterior wall extension
      of an inferior AMI made the diagnosis of anterior ischemia impossible. In another
      two patients (one anterior and one inferior AMI) reciprocal ST depression and
      infarcted area ECG changes showed a simultaneous evolution. The reciprocal ST
      depression could not be reproduced during stress testing and did not correlate
      with any angiographic lesion. It is concluded that reciprocal ST depression
      during the acute phase of transmural anterior or purely inferior myocardial
      infarction is correlated with multivessel coronary disease if their regression is
      not strictly simultaneous to the infarction-related ECG changes. Further
      investigations are indicated in these patients.

TI  - [Results after radical prostatectomy for prostate carcinoma].
PG  - 1834-40
AB  - 35 of 54 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized cancer were
      asymptomatic and the tumor had been found during a routine check-up by the family
      physician. In 53 of 54 patients the indication for surgery was based on a
      positive cytological finding in fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the suspected
      tumor. In all patients the carcinoma was confirmed by histological work-up of the
      radical prostatectomy specimen. Cytological and histological grading was
      identical in three quarters of all patients. However, the preoperative tumor
      stage (T) was confirmed histologically (pT) only in half of all the patients. The
      extension of the carcinoma was often underestimated at the preoperative clinical 
      staging. After a mean observation time of close to 4 years, the survival rate in 
      patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized cancer is comparable to
      an age and sex matched control group. Our data suggest that fine-needle
      aspiration biopsy of the prostate is a very reliable procedure in the diagnosis
      of prostatic carcinoma, provided the aspiration technique is correct and the
      smears are interpreted by a well-trained cytologist. Moreover, patients with
      localized prostate cancer seem to have an excellent chance of survival with low
      morbidity, provided the indication for surgery is restricted to carefully
      selected patients.

PG  - 1830-3
AB  - Polyneuropathy due to vasculitis in connection with rheumatoid arthritis is a
      rare complication of the disease. Special investigations can help us to
      distinguish between a peripheral sensory-neuropathy with a good prognosis, the
      neuropathy of the autonomous nervous system and the severe form of mononeuritis
      multiplex. The bad prognosis of this form is due to the diffuse vasculitis of
      internal organs. We describe 5 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and different
      forms of vasculitis. The differential diagnosis, therapy and prognosis are
      described in detail.

AB  - Individuals planning for a career in medicine must weigh a number of factors into
      their decisions. Increasingly, they must understand the nature of the
      socioeconomic environment of health care, including the extent of competition
      with other physicians and other health professionals; the degree of autonomy from
      health care institutions, government, and third-party payers; the impact of
      demographic or technological changes; and the economics of medical practice. This
      report analyzes the environment of medicine, emphasizing those elements that will
      be most important to medical students and resident physicians. It focuses on
      three stages of a physician's career: obtaining a medical education, beginning to
      practice medicine, and maintaining a viable practice.

AB  - This study describes a cohort of foreign medical school graduates (FMGs) who
      first sat for the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) 1982 certifying
      examination, compares their performance with that of US medical school graduates,
      describes differences between US citizen FMGs and alien FMGs, and examines which 
      background factors predict success on the ABIM examination. Data for this study
      were derived by combining information retained by the Educational Commission for 
      Foreign Medical Graduates with ABIM data. Most FMGs who took the 1982 ABIM
      certifying examination for the first time were educated in and citizens of Asia, 
      but a sizable minority were US citizens educated in Europe. Scores and program
      directors' ratings were lower for FMGs than US medical school graduates, and they
      attended different types of training programs. United States citizen FMGs were
      very similar to alien FMGs. Foreign medical school graduates who did well on the 
      ABIM examination had done well on the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical 
      Graduates examination and were rated highly by their residency program director.

TI  - Outcome of lung cancer patients requiring mechanical ventilation for pulmonary
      failure.
PG  - 3364-6
AB  - The prognosis of lung cancer patients who are not candidates for surgery is
      usually poor. The unfavorable natural history of respiratory failure in this
      group of patients has been suggested as a causative factor. We analyzed the
      outcome of 46 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer on whom mechanical
      ventilators were utilized. Although seven patients were ultimately weaned and
      survived for at least 24 hours, three of them subsequently died prior to
      discharge from the hospital. The remaining 39 patients died while using the
      ventilator. Patient age, tumor cell type, and the etiology of respiratory failure
      were not significantly different between the weaned and unweaned populations. A
      difference was noted in the duration of mechanical ventilation: none of the
      patients who could be weaned required mechanical ventilation for more than six
      days (range, two to six days). Respiratory failure in the nonsurgical lung cancer
      patient carries a poor prognosis, and selection of patients for mechanical
      ventilation should be conservative.

TI  - A termination site for Xenopus RNA polymerase I also acts as an element of an
      adjacent promoter.
PG  - 913-20
AB  - On the Xenopus laevis ribosomal genes, RNA polymerase traverses the entire
      repeating unit of gene plus spacer and terminates just upstream of the next gene 
      promoter. A conserved 7 bp element located at about -200 is an essential part of 
      this terminator. In this paper we show that, in addition to its termination
      function, this same sequence motif acts as an upstream element of the adjacent
      promoter and appears to contribute to the long-term stability of the
      transcription complex.

TI  - A transcription terminator located upstream of the mouse rDNA initiation site
      affects rRNA synthesis.
PG  - 901-11
AB  - Mouse ribosomal genes have a short sequence upstream of the transcription
      initiation site that is related in structure and function to the terminator boxes
      previously identified at the 3' end of the transcription unit. This upstream
      terminator recognizes the same protein factor as the 3'-terminal sites and is
      able to terminate RNA polymerase I transcription in vitro. S1 mapping and
      nucleolar run-on experiments reveal the presence of 5'-terminal spacer
      transcripts that are terminated at this site. These transcripts probably derive
      from spacer promoters, one of which has been identified approximately 2 kb
      upstream of the pre-rRNA start site. The interaction of a specific nuclear factor
      with the upstream terminator increases the efficiency of initiation, suggesting
      that transcription termination and initiation at the adjacent promoter work in an
      interrelated fashion.

TI  - A transcriptional terminator is a novel element of the promoter of the mouse
      ribosomal RNA gene.
PG  - 891-900
AB  - Sequences flanking residue-168 of the mouse rRNA gene are essential to direct
      efficient transcription in transfected cells and are stimulatory in vitro on
      closed circular templates. This promoter domain evidently functions by the
      unprecedented mechanism of terminating polymerase I-directed transcripts. It
      inhibits transcripts from reading into the initiation region, acting
      cotranscriptionally to end these RNAs at residue--182 and release them from the
      template. Most likely, polymerases on tandem genomic rRNA genes are not released 
      upon completing each 40-47S transcript, but traverse the entire spacer to the
      next promoter-terminator, where they are made available and positioned to favor
      reinitiation. Through such polymerase recycling, plus the binding of free
      polymerase, the rDNA promoters could achieve their characteristically high level 
      of transcription.

TI  - Caenorhabditis elegans compensates for the difference in X chromosome dosage
      between the sexes by regulating transcript levels.
PG  - 871-81
AB  - The primary sex-determining signal in the nematode C. elegans is the ratio of X
      chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X/A ratio). As a consequence, males (XO; ratio 
      0.5) and hermaphrodites (XX; ratio 1.0) possess different doses of X-linked
      genes. Here we demonstrate that C. elegans compensates for this disparity in gene
      dose by equalizing the levels of X-specific mRNA transcripts in the two sexes.
      Moreover, we show that mutations in three autosomal genes disrupt the process of 
      dosage compensation. Reduction in the activity of either dpy-21, dpy-27, or
      dpy-28 results in the overexpression of X-specific genes, 2- to 3-fold above
      wild-type levels.

TI  - Binding and cleavage of pre-tRNA by the Xenopus splicing endonuclease: two
      separable steps of the intron excision reaction.
PG  - 965-71
AB  - We have constructed three base-substitution mutants of the yeast tRNALeu3 gene.
      In two of them the ability to form an extended anticodon stem is lost. In the
      first mutant the bases encoding the anticodon change from TTG to GAC (positions
      37, 36, 35); in the second, the nucleotides encoding the region of the intron
      that base-pair with the anticodon change from CAA to GTC (positions 48, 47, 46). 
      The third is a double mutant characterized by both substitutions described above 
      so that its ability to form an extended anticodon stem is restored. The
      precursors derived from the two single mutants are accurately spliced in the X.
      laevis germinal vesicles (GV) extract: pairing of the anticodon with the intron, 
      therefore, is not required for the splicing reaction. The precursor derived from 
      the double mutant is not spliced, indicating that the new extended anticodon stem
      exerts an inhibitory action. Since the double mutant precursor binds to the
      purified splicing endonuclease, binding and cleavage occur as two separable steps
      in the intron excision reaction.

      packing for proteins are similar to that of aliphatic hydrocarbon-bonded silica
      packings.

      of proteins. A practical study.
PG  - 43-54
AB  - A number of commercially available columns for ion-exchange and
      hydrophobic-interaction high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have been
      tested, ranging from very fast columns with low capacity to preparative columns. 
      The experiments represent a selection of column applications likely to occur in a
      biochemical laboratory. The use of several ion-exchange columns for separation of
      serum and membrane proteins has been demonstrated. Columns with a silica gel
      matrix and with a polymer matrix have proved to be of equal value in experiments 
      with water-soluble proteins. In experiments with hydrophobic membrane proteins
      the choice of the column depends on the protein to be isolated. A combination of 
      a cation-exchange and an anion-exchange column as a tandem as well as a mixed-bed
      column, were applied for the separation of serum proteins and for the isolation
      of a 175,000-dalton membrane glycoprotein. One problem of hydrophobic-interaction
      HPLC is the poor solubility of some proteins, for example serum proteins at high 
      salt concentrations. This difficulty can be overcome by the use of columns with
      higher hydrophobicity which require lower initial salt concentrations. Less
      hydrophobic columns have been shown to separate hydrophobic membrane proteins by 
      a combination of salt and detergent gradients.

PG  - 37-42
AB  - A new assay technique for phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) activity 
      by high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line radiochemical detection is
      described. The method is based on the measurement of 14C-labelled products of the
      substrate, normetanephrine, using S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-14C]methionine as the
      methyl donor. The reaction products are determined from the reaction mixture
      after removal of protein by injecting an aliquot into the liquid chromatograph.
      The detection limit with 60% counting efficiency is 1.2 pmol of 14C-labelled
      product. The method is suitable for assaying PNMT activity in the adrenal and in 
      the brain tissue.

      dual-monitoring high-performance liquid chromatographic system with a
      site-directed fluorescent reagent.
PG  - 353-60
AB  - Sulphydryl groups of E. coli tryptophanase (L-tryptophan indole lyase, E.C.
      4.1.99.1) were made to react with a fluorescent maleimide derivative,
      N-(4-anilino-1-naphthyl)maleimide(ANM). By carefully controlling the reaction
      conditions it was possible to limit the extent of sulphydryl group modification. 
      The modified enzyme was digested with (L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl 
      ketone)-trypsin. The fluorescent peptides obtained were analysed by
      reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column with a
      dual-monitoring system consisting of a UV and a fluorescence monitor connected in
      tandem. This was followed by the determination of the amino acid composition of
      the fluorescent peptides. Comparison of these results with the known, complete
      primary structure of tryptophanase from the K-12 strain of E. coli allowed the
      assignment of position 298 to the cysteine residue, which is more selectively
      modified by ANM under the conditions chosen and is involved in the maintenance of
      the catalytic activity.

TI  - Protein conformational effects in hydrophobic interaction chromatography.
      Retention characterization and the role of mobile phase additives and stationary 
      phase hydrophobicity.
PG  - 3-27
AB  - We have studied the conformational behavior of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LACT) in 
      hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). Retention characterization in terms
      of Z (slope of plot of ln k' vs. ln phi B, where k' is the capacity factor and
      phi B is the volume fraction of mobile phase B) has been explored, and the
      relationship of Z to other slopes, such as S (slope of the plot of ln k' vs. phi 
      B) has been derived. The reasons for the sensitivity of Z to conformational
      change are discussed. The enhanced broadening of alpha-LACT in a temperature
      transition region of conformational change has been studied by spectral analysis 
      using on-line photodiode array detection. The influence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ addition
      to the mobile phase is further explored. Since alpha-LACT is a calcium binding
      protein, addition of this metal leads to stabilization, i.e. higher column
      temperatures are required for conformational change. On the other hand, addition 
      of Mg2+ appears to destabilize the protein. We have explored the use of a more
      hydrophobic support, C2-(ethyl) ether phase, for the elution of alpha-LACT. In
      this case, two widely separated peaks are observed. By spectral analysis the
      first peak is shown to be native and the later eluted, broad second peak to be an
      unfolded mixture of species. As previously observed in reversed-phase liquid
      chromatography, the second peak grows at the expense of the first, as the column 
      temperature is raised. The second peak also grows as the contact time of the
      protein with the surface increases. This behavior can be ascribed to the
      conformational change of alpha-LACT in the column, the late eluted species under 
      the second peak binding significantly more strongly to the phase than the native 
      peak. Reinjection of the late eluted fraction reveals that reformation of the
      native species takes place in solution within 30 min. As before, addition of Ca2+
      reduces the extent of unfolding under any specific condition. These results add
      further to our understanding and ability to control conformational changes in
      high-performance liquid chromatography.

TI  - Microwave extraction. A novel sample preparation method for chromatography.
PG  - 299-306
AB  - The applicability of microwave irradiation to the extraction of various types of 
      compounds from soil, seeds, foods and feeds as a novel sample preparation method 
      for chromatography was investigated. Samples were ground and mixed with an
      appropriate solvent, methanol or methanol-water for polar compounds and hexane
      for non-polar compounds. The suspensions were irradiated for 30 s, but they were 
      not allowed to boil. After cooling, the irradiation was repeated several times.
      The samples were then centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatant were injected 
      into a chromatographic column. The yields of the extracted compounds obtained by 
      microwave irradiation were compared with those obtained by the traditional
      Soxhlet or shake-flask extraction methods. The microwave extraction method was
      more effective than the conventional methods. Due to the considerable savings in 
      time and energy, this novel method is suitable for fast extractions of large
      sample series.

TI  - Assaying erythrocyte haem biosynthetic enzyme activities by high-performance
      liquid chromatography with the advanced automated sample processor.
PG  - 293-8
AB  - The four cytosolic haem biosynthetic enzymes in erythrocytes were assayed with
      the Varian advanced automated sample processor (AASP) for rapid sample
      concentration and clean-up with fast and effective high-performance liquid
      chromatography systems for separation and quantitation. In the assay for
      5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydrase, the porphobilinogen (PBG) formed was extracted 
      on a C18 AASP cartridge and separated by reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography
      with 32% methanol in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.5), containing 5.4 mM of 
      1-heptane-sulphonic acid as eluent. PBG was the substrate for the simultaneous
      assay of hydroxymethylbilane synthase and uroporphyrinogen III synthase. The
      uroporphyrinogen I and III isomers formed were oxidised to porphyrins,
      concentrated on a C2 or C8 cartridge, and separated by reversed-phase
      chromatography with 13% acetonitrile in 1 M ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.16) as 
      eluent. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was estimated with pentacarboxylic
      porphyrinogen III as substrate. The coproporphyrinogen formed was extracted on a 
      C2 or C8 cartridge, oxidised to coproporphyrin and separated by reversed-phase
      chromatography with 30% acetonitrile in 1 M ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.16) as 
      mobile phase.

PG  - 29-35
AB  - Interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with butyl and hydroxyl groups on
      adsorbent gel surfaces was investigated by using TSK HW-65 and Butyl Toyopearl
      650-M gels. It was found that BSA was adsorbed on the gel not only from highly
      concentrated ammonium sulphate but also from dilute perchloric acid,
      trichloroacetic acid, etc. Some eluent modifiers, such as organic solvents (30%
      aqueous methanol or acetonitrile), salt solutions (0.18-0.2 M phosphate) and
      hydrogen-bond breaking reagents (3-7 M urea, 10 M ethylene glycol, 0.1%
      triethylamine) were found to be effective in facilitating the elution of trapped 
      BSA from the gel. The conformational change of BSA in these solutions was slight 
      except for urea, and it was reversibly recovered after removal of the modifier
      from the aqueous solutions, except for the hydrogen-bond breaking reagents.

TI  - Mobile phase effects on the separations of substituted anilines with a
      beta-cyclodextrin-bonded column.
PG  - 269-82
AB  - The capacity factors of several substituted anilines were measured on a
      beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-bonded column with mobile phases varying from the
      classical, normal-phase condition, e.g. n-heptane-2-propanol, to the classical,
      reversed-phase condition, e.g. water-2-propanol. Different modifiers, such as
      acetonitrile, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran and a Partisil PXS-ODS column were
      also used for comparison. In general, it was found that the beta-CD column,
      having the ability to form inclusion complexes with certain substrates is better 
      and more selective in the reversed-phase separation of many aromatic compounds
      than the Partisil PXS-ODS column. The normal-phase separation on beta-CD was even
      more efficient, owing to the presence of large number of hydroxy groups on the
      surface of beta-CD molecules and the more rapid mass transfer in the column. In
      the present case, alcohols were found to be better modifiers than aprotic
      solvents. The effects of organic solvents on both normal-and reversed-phase
      separations are also discussed. The minima observed for the log k' vs. percent
      organic solvent plots for a number of substituted anilines are reasoned to
      originate from solute-solvent competition, which interacts with the stationary
      phase, as well as from the "relative solubility" of solutes in the stationary and
      mobile phases.

AB  - The direct separation of 26 bay region and non-bay region mono-ol and diol
      enantiomers of phenanthrene, benz[a]anthracene, and chrysene was compared by
      high-performance liquid chromatography on commercially available columns, packed 
      with gamma-aminopropylsilanized silica to which either
      (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine(R-DNBPG) or
      (S)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)leucine(S-DNBL) was either ionically or covalently
      bonded. In general, enantiomers of bay region mono-ols and diols are more
      efficiently resolved than those of non-bay region derivatives. Elution orders of 
      enantiomers on either chiral stationary phase are the same, regardless of whether
      the chiral stationary phase is ionically or covalently bonded. Except for the
      enantiomers of 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene,
      1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene trans-1,2-diol, and benz[a]anthracene
      trans-1,2-dihydrodiol, elution orders of resolved enantiomers on R-DNBPG are
      reversed on S-DNBL. The enantiomers are generally more efficiently resolved on
      R-DNBPG than on S-DNBL. With the exception of the elution order of the
      enantiomeric 4-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrochrysene, the results of this study are 
      consistent with the chiral recognition mechanisms proposed by Pirkle and
      co-workers, who developed the chiral stationary phases used in this study.

      enantiomers of benz[a]anthracene derivatives in chiral stationary phase
      high-performance liquid chromatography.
PG  - 195-209
AB  - The direct resolution of K-region cis- and trans-dihydrodiol enantiomers of 14
      unsubstituted and methyl- and bromo-substituted benz[a]anthracene (BA)
      derivatives was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with
      commercially available columns, packed with gamma-aminopropylsilanized silica to 
      which either (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine (R-DNBPG) or
      (S)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)leucine (S-DNBL) is either ionically or covalently
      bonded. BA derivatives used in this study include: BA, 1-methyl-BA, 4-methyl-BA, 
      7-methyl-BA, 8-methyl-BA, 10-methyl-BA, 11-methyl-BA, 12-methyl-BA,
      7,12-dimethyl-BA, 7-bromo-BA, 7-bromo-1-methyl-BA, 7-bromo-11-methyl-BA,
      7-bromo-12-methyl-BA, and 3-methylcholanthrene. The enantiomers of BA
      trans-5,6-dihydrodiol were the only compounds not resolved by any of the four
      chiral stationary phases (CSPs) tested. The results indicate that conformational 
      preference of the hydroxyl group is one of the most important factor in
      determining the elution order of dihydrodiol enantiomers. The presence and the
      location of a substituent and the molecular size and shape of the dihydrodiols
      can significantly affect the efficiency of enantiomeric resolution. In general,
      the ionically bonded R-DNBPG provides the best resolution of enantiomeric
      quasidiequatorial trans-dihydrodiols and the R,R enantiomers are consistently
      more strongly retained. In contrast, the enantiomeric pairs of quasidiaxial
      trans-dihydrodiols are generally better resolved by the covalently bonded
      R-DNBPG, and the S,S enantiomers are more strongly retained. The enantiomers of
      cis-dihydrodiols having hydroxyl groups that adopt quasiequatorial-quasiaxial
      and/or quasiaxial-quasiequatorial conformations are more consistently resolved by
      the ionically bonded S-DNBL and in all cases the S,R enantiomers are more
      strongly retained. Thus, it is possible to choose a CSP which resolves the
      K-region dihydrodiol enantiomers with a predictable elution order.

TI  - Resolution of enantiomeric amides on a Pirkle-type chiral stationary phase. A
      comparison of subcritical fluid and liquid chromatographic approaches.
PG  - 177-93
AB  - Subcritical and supercritical fluid chromatography (SubFC and SFC) have been
      evaluated for the resolution of an homologous series of enantiomeric amides. The 
      solutes were the 2-naphthoyl amides of an homologous series of amines, ranging
      from 2-aminobutane to 2-aminoctane, and the p-methyl-, p-methoxy- and
      p-chlorophenylamides of 2-aminoheptane. The chiral stationary phase (CSP) used
      was the covalent form of (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine. In liquid
      chromatography (LC) the mobile phase comprised hexane-2-propanol--acetonitrile
      (97:3:0.5) at a flow-rate of 2 ml/min and temperatures of 20-35 degrees C. In
      SFC, the mobile were various mixtures of carbon dioxide and polar modifiers, such
      as alcohols, chloroform and water. For the best conditions in LC, the chiral
      resolution, alpha, increased through the homologous series from alpha = 1.03 for 
      the amide derived from 2-aminobutane to alpha = 1.11 for the 2-aminooctane amide.
      The values of alpha observed for the pi-basic amides of 2-aminoheptane (p-methyl 
      and p-methoxy) were greater than that observed for the pi-acidic amide
      (p-chloro), i.e., alpha = 1.08 versus 1.04. The selectivities, resolutions and
      efficiencies obtained by LC and SubFC were similar. These results indicate that
      the mechanism of chiral recognition is the same in LC and SubFC and that the
      methods should be interchangeable. The actual analysis time for SubFC was
      significantly shorter than that required for LC: as short as 2 min for the
      2-aminooctane amide, whereas LC takes over 10 min under the best conditions.

      Competition between orotate- and hypoxanthine/guanine-phosphoribosyltransferases 
      for a common substrate.
PG  - 71-81
AB  - Enzymatic assay procedures that employ high-performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) have been proven to be sensitive and versatile methods for accomplishing
      kinetic analyses of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with nucleotides as substrates or
      products. Both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase) and
      hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) have been purified from
      Baker's yeast and analyzed kinetically using a modification of published HPLC
      procedures. Because these two enzymes exist in the cytosol of yeast and might
      compete for the limiting (approximately equal to 15 microM) concentration of
      phosphoribosyl alpha-1-pyrophosphate (PRibPP), we elected to examine both
      equilibrium and steady-state effects of one enzymatic reaction on the other with 
      HPLC. First, under the condition of equivalent mass concentrations of OPRTase and
      HGPRTase, the initial rate of orotidine monophosphate synthesis and the
      equilibrium state were greatly affected by the presence of HGPRTase activity. In 
      contrast, the presence of the OPRTase activity had no effect on the
      HGPRTase-catalyzed reaction under these conditions. Second, to examine a
      competition by these enzymes for PRibPP in vivo, we have established that the
      total activities (units/ml) of OPRTase and HGPRTase in yeast cell extracts were
      740 units/ml and 450 units/ml, respectively (a 1.7:1 ratio). These relative
      activities were then employed in an in vitro reaction competition analysis. The
      results were similar to the those obtained from experiments where equivalent
      OPRTase and HGPRTase activities were employed and reveal profound initial
      velocity and equilibrium effects of one reaction on the other. Thus a real
      competition between these enzymes for PRibPP may occur in the yeast cell cytosol,
      as determined by this unique HPLC competition assay procedure.

TI  - A proposal for financing health care of the elderly.
PG  - 3379-82
AB  - The American Medical Association House of Delegates has adopted a proposal for
      financing health care of the elderly, developed by the Board of Trustees, the
      Council on Medical Service, and the Council on Legislation. The proposal would
      replace the present Medicare program with a system of vouchers to older persons
      to purchase private health insurance policies or plans providing specified
      adequate benefits including catastrophic coverage. Vouchers would be financed by 
      a new tax on adjusted gross income during working years that would replace the
      present employee health insurance payroll tax, and by continuation of the
      employer health insurance payroll tax. Tax rates would be at a level sufficient
      both to meet obligations to current Medicare beneficiaries and, over a 30-year
      period, to achieve prefunding of benefits. All tax contributions after that date 
      would be preserved for the future use of those taxed, and could be invested
      during earning years, rather than being paid out immediately for present
      beneficiaries. The proposal would place health care for the elderly on a fiscally
      sound basis, provide increased cost sharing for those who are financially well
      off, and provide the protection against catastrophic health care expense lacking 
      under the current Medicare program.

PG  - 3376-8
AB  - The massive production of medical information is being met by new technologies
      for storing and retrieving knowledge. Recent years have witnessed the maturation 
      of time-sharing information utilities into a full-blown industry. In medicine
      these services have provided bibliographic information but have recently expanded
      to full-text availability of journals and books. Now optical storage technology, 
      most conspicuously the compact disk read only memory (CD-ROM), provides similar
      massive information storage and retrieval affordable to microcomputer users. Such
      devices might replace many of the functions of time-sharing.

TI  - The DNA binding domain and bending angle of E. coli CAP protein.
PG  - 995-1005
AB  - We use a new gel electrophoretic analysis to map the thermodynamically defined
      DNA binding domain of Escherichia coli CAP protein in the lac promoter. Strong
      binding interactions span a 28-30 bp duplex DNA region, substantially larger than
      that found for typical repressors. Sequence changes outside the central 28 bp of 
      the binding site are found to affect the electrophoretically observed extent of
      bending. We also report a study of the DNA bending induced at a symmetrized CAP
      binding site, compared with the wild-type site; binding and bending are stronger 
      at the upstream than at the downstream half of the wild-type site. Bends of the
      estimated 90 degrees - 180 degrees magnitude could play a vital regulatory role
      by producing tertiary structure in a local DNA domain, and by storing elastic
      energy for subsequent use in transcription or replication.

AB  - The yeast rna mutations (rna2-rna11) are a set of temperature-sensitive mutations
      that result in the accumulation of intron-containing mRNA precursors at the
      restrictive temperature. We have used the yeast in vitro splicing system to
      investigate the role of products of the RNA genes in mRNA splicing. We have
      tested the heat lability of the in vitro mRNA splicing reaction in extracts
      isolated from mutant and wild-type cells. Extracts isolated from seven of the
      nine rna mutants demonstrated heat lability in this assay, while most wild-type
      extracts were stable under the conditions utilized. We have also demonstrated
      that heat inactivation usually results in the specific loss of an exchangeable
      component by showing that most combinations of heat-inactivated extracts from
      different mutants complement one another. In three cases (rna2, rna5, and rna11),
      the linkage of the in vitro defect to the rna mutations was ascertained by a
      combination of reversion, tetrad, and in vitro complementation analyses.
      Furthermore, each heat-inactivated extract was capable of complementation by at
      least one fraction of the wild-type splicing system. Thus many of the RNA genes
      are likely to code for products directly involved in and essential for mRNA
      splicing.

TI  - Protein sorting in yeast: mutants defective in vacuole biogenesis mislocalize
      vacuolar proteins into the late secretory pathway.
PG  - 1041-51
AB  - We have devised a genetic selection for mutant yeast cells that fail to properly 
      deliver the vacuolar glycoprotein CPY to the lysosome-like vacuole. This has
      allowed us to identify mutations in eight VPL complementation groups that result 
      in aberrant secretion of up to approximately 90% of the immunoreactive CPY. Other
      soluble vacuolar proteins are also affected by each vpl mutation, demonstrating
      that a sorting system for multiple vacuolar proteins exists in yeast.
      Mislocalized CPY apparently traverses late stages of the secretory pathway, since
      a vesicle-accumulating sec1 mutation prevents secretion of this protein. Despite 
      the presence of abnormal membrane-enclosed organelles in some of the vpl mutants,
      maturation and secretion of invertase are not substantially perturbed. Thus vpl
      mutations define a new class of genes that encode products required for sorting
      of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins from secretory proteins during their
      transit through the yeast secretory pathway.

TI  - Model of protein conformation in the reversed-phase separation of interleukin-2
      muteins.
PG  - 313-33
AB  - Thirty muteins* of interleukin-2 were studied by reversed-phase high-performance 
      liquid chromatography in a gradient mode. Values of the stoichiometry-factor Z
      [from Geng and Regnier, J. Chromatogr., 296 (1984) 15] varied over a 2.5-fold
      range for these proteins of similar molecular weight and composition. It is
      proposed that the more hydrophobic and/or more stable proteins have smaller
      values of Z while the larger Z-values correspond to a higher degree of protein
      unfolding during reversed-phase retention. The practical utility of this approach
      was demonstrated when these Z values were used to predict correctly a reversal in
      elution order for two closely related interleukin-2 muteins, when shallower
      gradients were used.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of antigen-Ia complexes involved in T cell
      recognition.
PG  - 1071-7
AB  - Using equilibrium dialysis, it has been previously demonstrated that immunogenic 
      peptides bind specifically to the Ia molecules serving as restriction elements in
      the immune response to these antigens. Using gel filtration to study the
      formation of ovalbumin (OVA) peptide-I-Ad complexes, it is herein demonstrated
      that the complexes, once formed, are very stable (kd approximately equal to 3 X
      10(-6) s-1), but the rate of complex formation is very slow (ka approximately 1
      M-1 s-1 explaining the overall low equilibrium constant of approximately 2 X
      10(-6) M. Treating the complexes with glutaraldehyde revealed that the ovalbumin 
      peptide was cross-linked solely to the alpha chain of I-Ad. Planar membranes
      containing I-Ad-OVA complexes stimulated a T cell response with 2 X 10(4) less
      antigen than required when uncomplexed antigen was used, thus demonstrating the
      biologic importance of these complexes in antigen recognition.

TI  - Hemolytic anemia and erythroleukemia, two distinct pathogenic effects of Friend
      MuLV: mapping of the effects to different regions of the viral genome.
PG  - 851-9
AB  - Two different pathogenic effects of the Friend ecotropic murine leukemia virus
      (F-MuLV) were distinguished by serial examinations of hematocrits and
      reticulocyte counts of IRW mice inoculated as newborns. F-MuLV induced hemolytic 
      anemia with increased levels of erythropoiesis, which was detectable as early as 
      13 days of age, whereas blocked erythroid differentiation, associated with
      erythroleukemia, was apparent only after 30 days of age. Using strains of
      Friend-MuLV with different virulences, we constructed recombinant viruses that
      allowed us to map the hemolytic effect and the ability to induce rapid
      erythroleukemia to different regions of the viral genome. Moreover, the ability
      of the virus to induce rapid erythroleukemia appeared to be independent of the
      presence of severe early hemolytic anemia.

TI  - The comparative cost-effectiveness of statistical decision rules and experienced 
      physicians in pharyngitis management.
PG  - 3353-7
AB  - We examined whether probability-based decisions for streptococcal pharyngitis,
      using probabilities derived from predictive models along with Tompkins' decision 
      rules, could be more cost-effective than the actual decisions of ten physicians. 
      We retrospectively calculated the probability of a positive throat culture
      ("disease") for each of 310 patients using four different models based on
      discriminant analysis (1), a branching algorithm (2), and logistic regression (3 
      and 4). "Projected decisions" were based on these probabilities and Tompkins'
      rules. We calculated direct medical and indirect costs per correct action taken
      (diseased patient-treated or nondiseased patient-not-treated). Two models'
      projected decisions were more cost-effective than the physicians'. Model 1
      primarily would have reduced treatment costs (leaving no diseased patient
      untreated); model 4 primarily would have reduced throat culture costs (with 15%
      projected undertreatment). While using statistical decision rules may be
      cost-effective in this setting, their adoption should be consistent with
      physician and patient priorities.

TI  - Inducibility of kappa immunoglobulin enhancer-binding protein Nf-kappa B by a
      posttranslational mechanism.
PG  - 921-8
AB  - NF-kappa B is a nuclear protein, found only in cells that transcribe
      immunoglobulin light chain genes, that interacts with a defined site in the kappa
      immunoglobulin enhancer. This protein can be induced in pre-B cells by
      stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The induction involves a
      posttranslational activation, and the combined action of LPS and cycloheximide
      causes a superinduction. An active phorbol ester also induces this factor, and
      with kinetics more rapid than those for LPS stimulation. Phorbol-ester-mediated
      induction of NF-kappa B was observed in a T cell line (Jurkat) and a nonlymphoid 
      cell line (HeLa), and is therefore not restricted to B-lymphoid cells. We
      interpret these results to indicate that factors that control transcription of
      specific genes in specific cells may be activated by posttranslational
      modification of precursor factors present more widely.

TI  - A conserved family of nuclear proteins containing structural elements of the
      finger protein encoded by Kruppel, a Drosophila segmentation gene.
PG  - 1025-32
AB  - Kruppel (Kr), a segmentation gene of Drosophila, encodes a protein sharing
      structural features of the DNA-binding "finger motif" of TFIIIA, a Xenopus
      transcription factor. Low-stringency hybridization of the Kr finger coding
      sequence revealed multiple copies of homologous DNA sequences in the genomes of
      Drosophila and other eukaryotes. Molecular analysis of one Kr-homologous DNA
      clone identified a developmentally regulated gene. Its product, a finger protein,
      relates to Kr by the invariant positioning of crucial amino acid residues within 
      the finger repeats and by a stretch of seven amino acids connecting the finger
      loops, the "H/C link." This H/C link is conserved in several nuclear and
      chromosome-associated proteins of Drosophila and other eukaryotic organisms
      including mammals. Our results demonstrate a new subfamily of evolutionarily
      conserved nuclear and possibly DNA-binding proteins that again relate to a
      Drosophila segmentation gene as in the case of the homeo domain.

TI  - High-performance immobilized-metal affinity chromatography of proteins on
      iminodiacetic acid silica-based bonded phases.
PG  - 335-52
AB  - High-performance separations of proteins, based on immobilized-metal affinity
      chromatography (HPIMAC), are described. The stationary phase consisted of
      iminodiacetic acid (IDA) chelate groups, bonded to small particle, wide pore
      silica gel by means of a polyether hydrophilic leash. After loading the column
      with metal, retention of proteins was achieved by protein-metal complexation at
      high concentrations of sodium sulfate. Elution was accomplished by addition of
      competitive complexing ligands, such as ammonia at constant pH, and/or by a
      decreasing pH gradient of a specially designed buffer system to maintain buffer
      capacity constant throughout the gradient. Selective separations, based on
      differences in the number of histidine residues present on the surface of the
      proteins, are described. The application of HPIMAC in the separation and
      purification of structurally similar proteins is presented. The potential
      application of IDA columns in three chromatographic modes (HPIMA, hydrophobic
      interaction, and cation exchange) is also described.

TI  - Transport into mitochondria and intramitochondrial sorting of the Fe/S protein of
      ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase.
PG  - 939-51
AB  - The Fe/S protein of complex III is encoded by a nuclear gene, synthesized in the 
      cytoplasm as a precursor with a 32 residue amino-terminal extension, and
      transported to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our data
      suggest the following transport pathway. First, the precursor is translocated via
      translocation contact sites into the matrix. There, cleavage to an intermediate
      containing an eight residue extension occurs. The intermediate is then redirected
      across the inner membrane, processed to the mature subunit, and assembled into
      complex III. We suggest that the folding and membrane-translocation pathway in
      the endosymbiotic ancestor of mitochondria has been conserved during evolution of
      eukaryotic cells; transfer of the gene for Fe/S protein to the nucleus has led to
      addition of the presequence, which routes the precursor back to its "ancestral"
      assembly pathway.

TI  - Yeast peptide pheromones, a-factor and alpha-factor, activate a common response
      mechanism in their target cells.
PG  - 929-37
AB  - We show that in yeast the cell type specificity of pheromone response is
      determined solely by the species of receptor that a cell synthesizes. The two
      receptor-pheromone interactions are functionally interchangeable and involve the 
      creation of a common intracellular signal. In particular, we find that provision 
      of a-factor receptor or alpha-factor receptor in mat alpha 1 mutants, which
      normally do not express either receptor or any other a- or alpha-specific
      products, allows response to the appropriate pheromone. Moreover, provision of
      a-factor receptor in a cells lacking alpha-factor receptor restores mating
      competence to those cells. Finally, an aspect of pheromone response that is
      normally unique to a-factor action on alpha cells--increased transcription from
      the alpha-specific STE3 gene--can also be observed following alpha-factor
      treatment of pseudo-a cells (mat alpha 2 ste3 ste13), special mutants that
      respond to alpha-factor and also have an active STE3 promoter.

TI  - The structure of the termini of the Epstein-Barr virus as a marker of clonal
      cellular proliferation.
PG  - 883-9
AB  - The linear virion form of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has variable numbers of
      direct tandem 500 bp repeats at each terminus. The terminal restriction
      endonuclease fragments and the fused terminal fragments in the intracellular
      episomal form are heterogeneous in size, and vary by increments of 500 bp. The
      structure of the termini of EBV in carcinomas of the nasopharynx and the parotid 
      gland was compared with the EBV termini in monoclonal and polyclonal tissues or
      cell lines. A single band representing the EBV joined termini was detected in
      each of the carcinomas and in the monoclonal lymphoid proliferations. Polyclonal 
      cell lines contained multiple forms of the joined termini. The detection of a
      homogeneous episomal population suggests that EBV-associated epithelial
      malignancies are clonal expansions of a single EBV-infected progenitor cell.

TI  - Bidirectional pigment granule movements of melanophores are regulated by protein 
      phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
PG  - 1061-70
AB  - Studies were conducted to investigate the molecular basis for bidirectional
      pigment granule transport in digitonin-lysed melanophores. Pigment granule
      dispersion, but not aggregation, required cAMP and resulted in the
      phosphorylation of a 57 kd polypeptide. cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor
      prevented this phosphorylation as well as pigment dispersal. In contrast, both
      pigment aggregation and the concomitant dephosphorylation of the 57 kd
      polypeptide were blocked by phosphatase inhibitors. These data support a model in
      which pigment dispersion and aggregation require protein phosphorylation and
      dephosphorylation, respectively. Furthermore, studies using the ATP analog, ATP
      gamma S, suggest either that protein phosphorylation alone is sufficient for
      dispersion or that transport is mediated by a unique force-generating ATPase that
      can use ATP gamma S for hydrolyzable energy.

      of the intact and truncated envelope glycoproteins to apical or basolateral
      surfaces was studied in the polarized epithelial MDCK cell line. Infection of
      MDCK cells with the recombinant expressing the intact F-MCFV envelope
      glycoprotein resulted in transport exclusively to the basolateral surfaces,
      whereas the recombinant expressing the truncated glycoprotein was found to be
      secreted from both the apical and basolateral surfaces. Thus removal of the
      transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the p15E protein results in a loss of
      directional transport to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells.

PG  - 3358-63
AB  - We analyzed the data on 15,438 consecutive medical inpatients monitored by the
      Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program from June 1975 to June 1982 to
      determine the rates of allergic cutaneous reactions to drugs introduced since
      1975 and to confirm and extend findings from an earlier study of the preceding
      22,227 patients. There were 358 reactions occurring in 347 patients, for an
      overall reaction rate among patients of 2.2%. Each patient received a mean of
      eight different drugs. Rashes were attributed to 51 drugs, and 75% of the
      allergic cutaneous reactions were attributed to antibiotics, blood products, and 
      inhaled mucolytics. Amoxicillin (51.4 reactions per 1000 patients exposed),
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33.8/1000), and ampicillin (33.2/1000) had the
      highest reaction rates. Drug-specific reaction rates ranged from zero to 51.4 per
      1000 and were determined for 180 drugs or drug groups. These results provide
      physicians with quantitative data that will be helpful in clinical decision
      making when drug-induced exanthems, urticaria, or generalized pruritus occurs.

TI  - A protein associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles recognizes
      the 3' splice site of premessenger RNA.
PG  - 973-84
AB  - A HeLa cell nuclear extract active in splicing of pre-mRNA has been fractionated 
      to identify the component that interacts with the 3' splice site. The activity
      that binds this region in an RNAase T1 protection assay copurifies with a 70 kd
      protein which is recognized by anti-Sm antibodies. Protein blots probed with
      labeled mRNA precursors either containing or lacking an intact 3' splice site
      reveal that the 70 kd polypeptide can bind pre-mRNA after immobilization on
      nitrocellulose and that it shows a preference for sequences located between the
      3' splice junction and the site of lariat formation. Cofractionation during
      chromatography and immunoprecipitation by anti-2,2,7-trimethylguanosine
      antibodies demonstrate that the 3' splice site binding component associates with 
      small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles in low (1 mM) but not high (15 mM) Mg++
      concentrations.

TI  - The clam embryo protein cyclin A induces entry into M phase and the resumption of
      meiosis in Xenopus oocytes.
PG  - 861-70
AB  - Fertilized clam embryos synthesize several new cell-cycle-related proteins. The
      cloned cDNA and derived amino acid sequences of one of these, cyclin A, are
      presented here. Immunoblots with an anti-cyclin A antibody reveal that cyclin A
      is undetectable in oocytes, appears within 15 min of fertilization, and is
      destroyed near the end of each meiosis and mitosis. We directly tested the
      ability of cyclin A to induce M phase by injecting SP6 cyclin A mRNA into Xenopus
      oocytes, which are arrested at the G2/M border of first meiosis. The injected
      mRNA was translated, with the result that the Xenopus oocytes entered meiosis.
      These findings indicate that the rise in cyclin A plays a direct and natural role
      in driving cells into M phase.

TI  - A bipotential neuroendocrine precursor whose choice of cell fate is determined by
      NGF and glucocorticoids.
PG  - 1079-90
AB  - Adrenal medullary endocrine (chromaffin) cells and sympathetic neurons both
      derive from the neural crest. We have found that the embryonic adrenal medulla
      and sympathetic ganglia are both initially populated by precursors expressing
      neural-specific genes. By birth, however, the medulla consists largely of
      chromaffin cells. In primary culture, the medullary precursors have three
      developmental fates: in NGF they continue to mature into neurons and survive,
      whereas in glucocorticoid they either extinguish their neuronal properties and
      exhibit an endocrine phenotype, or else continue to develop into neurons but then
      die. These data suggest that, in vivo, the adrenal medulla develops through both 
      the glucocorticoid-induced differentiation of bipotential progenitors and the
      degeneration of committed neuronal precursors, which have migrated into the
      gland.

TI  - Conservation of a large protein domain in the segmentation gene paired and in
      functionally related genes of Drosophila.
PG  - 1033-40
AB  - Extending our search for homologous domains of the Drosophila paired gene, two
      closely linked genes at the gooseberry locus have been isolated. Both genes are
      expressed with a single segment periodicity but with different spatial and
      temporal expression patterns. While the transcripts of one gene appear earlier
      and are equally distributed between ectoderm and mesoderm, those of the second
      gene accumulate preferentially in neuroblasts. The similarity of these expression
      patterns to the 14-band pattern of the paired gene suggests a functional
      relationship. Such a functional link may be reflected in the two structurally
      homologous domains shared with the paired gene: a new type of homeo box extended 
      by 18 amino acids at the 5' end, and a new domain, the paired box, consisting of 
      a sequence of 128-135 amino acids. Thus, together with the PRD repeat, the paired
      gene contains at least three different domains, each defining a gene set thought 
      to be important for development.

AB  - Binding of tRNAPhe to ribosomes shields a set of highly conserved nucleotides in 
      16S rRNA from attack by a combination of structure-specific chemical probes. The 
      bases can be classified according to whether or not their protection is strictly 
      poly(U)-dependent (G529, G530, U531, A1408, A1492, and A1493) or
      poly(U)-independent (A532, G693, A794, C795, G926, 2mG966, G1338, A1339, U1381,
      C1399, C1400, and G1401). A third class (A790, G791, and A909) is shielded by
      both tRNA and 50S ribosomal subunits. Similar results are obtained when the
      protecting ligand is tRNAPhe E. Coli, tRNAPhe yeast, tRNAPhe E. Coli lacking its 
      3' terminal CA, or the 15 nucleotide anticodon stem-loop fragment of tRNAPhe
      yeast. Implications for structural correlates of the classic ribosomal A- and
      P-sites and for the possible involvement of 16S rRNA in translational
      proofreading are discussed.

TI  - An inversion that disrupts the Antennapedia gene causes abnormal structure and
      localization of RNAs.
PG  - 1017-23
AB  - Mutations in Drosophila homeotic genes lead to the developmental replacement of
      one normal body part by another. We have examined the mechanism by which a
      dominant allele of the Antennapedia (Antp) gene causes the antennae to be
      replaced by legs. Normal Antp gene activity is required for thoracic but not for 
      head development. We demonstrate that the Antp73b inversion mutation results in
      Antp transcription in the head. Antp transcripts found in this abnormal location 
      are of two types: normal-sized Antp RNAs and fusion RNAs joining Antp exons
      (including the protein-coding region) to 5' exons from another gene. This foreign
      gene is normally expressed in the head, suggesting the cause for abnormal
      activation of Antp. The result is a change of cell identity from head to thorax.

TI  - Transposable elements controlling I-R hybrid dysgenesis in D. melanogaster are
      similar to mammalian LINEs.
PG  - 1007-15
AB  - I-R hybrid dysgenesis in D. melanogaster is controlled by transposable elements
      known as I factors. We have determined the base sequences of one complete I
      factor and the ends of six others. The ends of these elements are highly
      conserved and are flanked by target site duplications varying in length from
      10-14 bp. There are no terminal repeats, and the 3' end of one strand is A-rich, 
      having 4-7 tandem repeats of the sequence TAA. This sequence organization is
      similar to that of mammalian LINEs, or L1 elements. The complete I factor
      sequence contains two long open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, of 1278 and 3258
      bp. ORF1 encodes a possible nucleic acid-binding protein, and part of the amino
      acid sequence of ORF2 is similar to that of viral reverse transcriptases and
      polypeptides encoded by L1 elements. These results suggest that I factors
      transpose by reverse transcription of a full-length RNA.

TI  - A population-based study of multiple sclerosis in twins.
PG  - 1638-42
AB  - Results from studies of twin concordance in multiple sclerosis have not
      conclusively differentiated between environmental and genetic factors that
      determine susceptibility to the disease. Published studies that have been based
      on case finding by public appeal have been characterized by difficulties in
      ascertainment. The data reported here are from a large population-based study of 
      multiple sclerosis in twins, in which ascertainment has been relatively unbiased 
      and the cooperation of patients nearly complete. A total of 5463 patients
      attending 10 multiple sclerosis clinics across Canada were surveyed. Twenty-seven
      monozygotic and 43 dizygotic twin pairs were identified, and the diagnosis of
      multiple sclerosis was verified by examination and laboratory investigation.
      Seven of 27 monozygotic pairs (25.9 percent) and 1 of 43 dizygotic pairs (2.3
      percent) were concordant for multiple sclerosis. The concordance rate for 4582
      nontwin siblings of patients at two multiple sclerosis clinics was 1.9 percent,
      closely paralleling the concordance rate in dizygotic twins. To the extent that
      the difference in concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins
      indicates genetic susceptibility, the results of this study show a major genetic 
      component in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Relation between the frequency of colorectal adenoma and the serum cholesterol
      level.
PG  - 1634-8
AB  - Several investigators have reported an association between low serum cholesterol 
      levels and an increased frequency of colorectal cancer. Because low cholesterol
      levels may be a result of an established cancer, we have investigated the
      relation between serum cholesterol levels and the frequency of colorectal
      adenomas, which are thought to be precursors of colon cancer. We prospectively
      studied 1083 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy (241 of whom were
      excluded because of malignant disease, chronic inflammatory bowel disease,
      familial polyposis, or partial colectomy). In the remaining 842 patients,
      analysis of covariance was performed to evaluate the contribution of serum
      cholesterol to the risk of colorectal adenoma. Serum cholesterol levels were
      significantly and positively associated with the frequency of colorectal adenoma 
      in subjects of both sexes. After adjustment for age and body-mass index, this
      positive association remained significant between the top quintile and the lowest
      quintile for serum cholesterol, with regard to the total study group (odds ratio,
      2.0; 95 percent confidence limits, 1.1 and 3.6) and men only (odds ratio, 2.2; 95
      percent confidence limits, 1.0 and 4.8). We conclude that there is not an inverse
      correlation between serum cholesterol levels and the risk of colorectal adenomas;
      on the contrary, there appears to be a small positive association.

PG  - 1629-33
AB  - We studied the risk of colorectal cancer in relation to serum cholesterol and
      beta-lipoprotein in more than 92,000 Swedish subjects less than 75 years old. The
      cohort was examined between 1963 and 1965 and followed by means of the Swedish
      Cancer Register until 1979. During this period, 528 colon cancers and 311 rectal 
      cancers developed. A positive association was observed between the serum
      cholesterol level and the risk of rectal cancer among men (P less than 0.05),
      with a relative risk of 1.65 in men with levels greater than or equal to 276 mg
      per deciliter (7.1 mmol per liter). An association was also observed between the 
      serum beta-lipoprotein level and the risk of rectal cancer among men (P less than
      0.05). When cholesterol and beta-lipoprotein levels were considered together,

      in men with both cholesterol greater than or equal to 250 mg per deciliter (6.5
      mmol per liter) and beta-lipoprotein greater than or equal to 12 units (2.2 g per

      and 1.70 for rectal cancer (1.18 to 2.44). Similar trends were observed in women,
      although they were not statistically significant.

TI  - The effects of cerebrosides on model membrane shape.
PG  - 17177-82
AB  - Model membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine, various cerebrosides, and
      cholesterol have been studied by electron microscopy, deuterium NMR, and
      phosphorus-31 NMR. Large variations in phosphatidylcholine membrane morphology
      are observed when cerebrosides are present in phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Large
      spherical liposomes, small spherical liposomes, and long tubular liposomes are
      formed, depending on the relative acyl chain lengths of the phosphatidylcholine
      and cerebroside. In some cases, cholesterol can reverse the morphological effects
      of cerebrosides. These results suggest that cerebrosides, which are found in high
      concentrations in certain highly specialized membranes, can affect membrane shape
      and may be involved in the mechanism of formation of membranes with unusual
      morphology, e.g. neural myelin and the brush border membrane of the intestinal
      epithelium.

TI  - Lipoprotein biosynthesis in the larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta.
PG  - 17174-6
AB  - Lipoprotein biosynthesis in larvae of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) was
      investigated. By immunoblotting, it was shown that the apoproteins are present in
      the fat body, but not in the midgut. Fat body incubated in vitro with
      [35S]methionine secreted labeled apoproteins. However, when the density of the
      secreted particle was determined, it was found at 1.24-1.28 g/ml instead of 1.15 
      g/ml, which is the density of the circulating lipoprotein. Lipid analysis of
      immunoprecipitated lipoprotein secreted by the fat body showed a
      phospholipid/diacylglycerol ratio of 8.3 rather than 0.9, the ratio found in the 
      circulating lipoprotein. When labeled oleic acid or triolein was fed to larvae,
      it was found that greater than 98% of the label in the circulating lipoprotein
      was in diacylglycerol. In studies using animals raised on a fat-free diet, it was
      shown that the circulating lipoprotein has properties comparable to those of the 
      material secreted in vitro by the fat body and that this diacylglycerol-poor
      particle can be converted to the normal lipoprotein by feeding a bolus of
      triolein. These data support the hypothesis that the fat body makes and secretes 
      a "nascent" lipoprotein which contains apoproteins and phospholipid, but is
      devoid of diacylglycerol. The diacylglycerol is then picked up from the midgut to
      complete assembly of the mature circulating lipoprotein.

TI  - Purification and characterization of actobindin, a new actin monomer-binding
      protein from Acanthamoeba castellanii.
PG  - 17150-5
AB  - Actobindin is a new actin-binding protein isolated from Acanthamoeba castellanii.
      It is composed of two possibly identical polypeptide chains of approximately
      13,000 daltons, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis, and with isoelectric points of 5.9. In the native state,
      actobindin appears to be a dimer of about 25,000 daltons by sedimentation
      equilibrium analysis. It contains no tryptophan and probably no tyrosine.
      Actobindin reduces the concentration of F-actin at steady state and inhibits the 
      rate of filament elongation to extents consistent with the formation of a 1:1
      actobindin-G-actin complex in a reaction with a KD of about 5 microM. The
      available data do not eliminate the possibility of other stoichiometries for the 
      complex, but they are not consistent with any significant interaction between
      actobindin and F-actin. Despite the similarities between the effects of
      actobindin and Acanthamoeba profilin on the polymerization of Acanthamoeba actin,
      the two proteins are quite distinct with different native and subunit molecular
      weights, different isoelectric points, and different amino acid compositions.
      Also, unlike profilin, actobindin binds as well to rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin
      and to pyrenyl-labeled G-actin as it does to unmodified Acanthamoeba G-actin.

      protein content is correlated with plasma LDL cholesterol concentration.
PG  - 17127-33
AB  - Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity has been detected and identified 
      in human liver samples by ligand blotting with biotinylated lipoproteins and by
      immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody raised against the bovine adrenal LDL
      receptor. The molecular weight of the human liver LDL receptor, approximately
      132,000 on nonreduced polyacrylamide gels, is identical to that of LDL receptors 
      detected in normal human skin fibroblasts by the same methods. LDL
      receptor-dependent binding activity in human liver samples has been
      semi-quantitated by integrating the areas under the peaks after scanning
      photographs of ligand blots, and receptor protein determined by radioimmunoassay 
      with purified bovine adrenal LDL receptor protein as the standard. There was a
      highly significant correlation between the values obtained by each method for
      seven different liver samples (r = 0.948). The LDL receptor protein content of
      liver membranes from 10 subjects as determined by radioimmunoassay was inversely 
      related to the plasma LDL cholesterol concentration (r = 0.663, p = 0.05) but not
      to other plasma lipid values, including total plasma cholesterol, high density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, or plasma triglyceride concentrations.

TI  - Characteristics of a lysosomal membrane transport system for tyrosine and other
      neutral amino acids in rat thyroid cells.
PG  - 17107-12
AB  - Tyrosine countertransport was used to demonstrate the existence of a carrier
      system for neutral amino acids in the lysosomal membrane of FRTL-5 thyroid cells.
      In addition to tyrosine, the carrier system recognized the neutral amino acids
      leucine, histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. Cystine and lysine, amino
      acids for which a lysosomal carrier system has been demonstrated, showed no
      competition with tyrosine for countertransport. The tyrosine system showed
      stereospecificity and cation independence. It did not require an acidic lysosome 
      or the availability of free thiols. The apparent Km for tyrosine was
      approximately 100 microM; the energy of activation of the system was
      approximately 9.7 kcal/mol. This new lysosomal membrane carrier system for
      neutral amino acids resembles the plasma membrane L system in 3T3 Chinese hamster
      ovary cells and melanoma B-16 cells.

TI  - Effects of phorbol esters, diglyceride, and cholinergic agonists on the
      subcellular distribution of protein kinase C in intact or digitonin-permeabilized
      adrenal chromaffin cells.
PG  - 17099-106
AB  - Phorbol esters which activate protein kinase C increased the percentage of
      membrane-bound protein kinase C activity in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells from 
      less than 10 to 20-50% within 30 min. Permeabilization of chromaffin cells with
      digitonin in the absence of Ca2+ and phorbol esters caused virtually 100% of the 
      protein kinase C activity to leave the cells within 1 h, which is consistent with
      protein kinase C being soluble and cytosolic. However, if cells were incubated
      for 15-30 min with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) prior to
      permeabilization, 50-60% of the protein kinase C activity exited from the cells
      within 1 h of permeabilization. In cells not incubated with phorbol ester,
      permeabilization in the presence of 1-10 microM Ca2+ also decreased the rate at
      which protein kinase C exited from the cells. The slower release of protein
      kinase C caused by prior incubation of the cells with TPA or because of the
      presence of micromolar Ca2+ in permeabilized cells was associated with increased 
      membrane-bound protein kinase C. The effects of TPA and permeabilization in the
      presence of micromolar Ca2+ were approximately additive. Active phorbol esters
      had different abilities to cause retention of protein kinase C in
      digitonin-treated cells. Dioctanoylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C in 
      vitro and enhanced Ca2+-dependent secretion from permeabilized chromaffin cells
      similarly to TPA, also increased membrane-bound protein kinase C in intact cells,
      but had no effect on the retention of protein kinase C in permeabilized cells in 
      the presence or absence of Ca2+. The different abilities of protein kinase C
      activators to cause retention of protein kinase C in subsequently permeabilized
      cells suggest differences in the reversibility of the binding. The mixed
      nicotinic-muscarinic agonist carbachol and the nicotinic agonist
      1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium, but not the muscarinic agonist muscarine,
      caused 3-10% of the total protein kinase C activity to become membrane-bound
      within 3 min in intact chromaffin cells. Thus, nicotinic stimulation of
      chromaffin cells may rapidly activate protein kinase C.

      IV6NeuAc-nLc4Cer), I-active and i-active (VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer) gangliosides, and
      GM3-NeuAc commonly exhibited significant specific receptor activity toward the
      viruses. A/PR/8/34 recognized IV3NeuAc-nLc4Cer containing the NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal 
      sequence preferentially over IV6NeuAc-nLc4Cer containing NeuAc alpha 2-6Gal,
      whereas the other two recognized the NeuAc alpha 2-6Gal sequence preferentially
      over NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal. Responsiveness of erythrocytes labeled with gangliosides
      containing NeuGc to the viruses used was considerably lower than that of
      erythrocytes labeled with gangliosides containing NeuAc. The activities of GM1a, 
      GM2, and GD1b bearing NeuAc on inner galactose of the ganglio series core were
      also very low. These results indicate that sialyloligosaccharides of
      IV3NeuAc-nLc4Cer, IV6NeuAc-nLc4Cer, I-active ganglioside, and VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer in
      addition to GM3-NeuAc and GM1b-NeuAc (Suzuki, Y., Matsunaga, M., and Matsumoto,

      functional receptor determinants toward hemagglutinin of human influenza A
      viruses, and the viruses differentiate microdomains of the gangliosides, such as 
      the sialic acid species (NeuAc, NeuGc) and the sequence of sialic acid linkages
      (NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal, NeuAc alpha 2-6Gal).

      chromatography.
PG  - 17004-10
AB  - Human class II molecules include the HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP alloantigens. Each
      class II molecule consists of two glycosylated polypeptide chains, the alpha
      chain and the beta chain. We have used lectin affinity analysis to investigate
      the glycosylation pattern of [3H]mannose-labeled glycopeptides derived from
      isolated alpha and beta chains of HLA-DR and -DQ molecules of normal tonsil
      cells. Glycopeptides obtained by Pronase digestion of each isolated chain were
      passed sequentially over columns of immobilized concanavalin A, Lens culinaris
      lectin, and phytohemagglutinins E and L in a prescribed manner to generate a
      lectin affinity profile which could be used to assign a minimal oligosaccharide
      structure for each glycopeptide studied. The data presented here demonstrate that
      a given class II polypeptide chain can bear several different oligosaccharides.
      Comparison of the glycosylation patterns of the HLA-DR and -DQ molecules shows
      that they are similar in most respects. However, there are qualitative
      differences in the oligosaccharides borne by HLA-DQ and -DR molecules. In
      addition, comparison between HLA-DQ and the homologous murine I-A molecules shows
      species-specific glycosylation patterns.

TI  - Parathyroid hormone stimulates dephosphorylation of the renoredoxin component of 
      the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase from rat renal cortex.
PG  - 16998-7003
AB  - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the renal conversion of 25-OH-vitamin D3 to 
      1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 in young animals. There is evidence that PTH acts via cAMP 
      and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but the identity of the phosphorylated
      protein(s) is unknown. The present study investigates the possibility that
      phosphorylation modification of specific components of the renal mitochondrial,
      cytochrome P-450-linked 25-OH-vitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase is involved in the
      regulation of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 production. Mitochondria were isolated from
      [32P]phosphate-labeled renal cortical slices which had been divided into control 
      and agonist-treated groups. The hydroxylase protein components from the
      solubilized mitochondria were partially purified using
      p-chloroamphetamine-Sepharose affinity chromatography and polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis. Phosphorylation was observed only in a protein with an Mr =
      12,000 and a pI of 4.2 by autoradiography of the gels. This radiolabeled protein 
      was immunoprecipitated with adrenodoxin antibody. Additionally, the protein in
      the same Mr region of the polyacrylamide gel reacted with adrenodoxin antibody
      and co-migrated with bovine adrenodoxin. PTH and forskolin treatment resulted in 
      decreased phosphate incorporation into the protein, whereas A23187 treatment
      increased the phosphorylation. In parallel experiments, affinity-isolated
      hydroxylase from control and PTH-treated slices was used to assess in vitro
      hydroxylase activity using [3H]25-hydroxyvitamin D3 as substrate. The hydroxylase
      activity derived from PTH-treated tissue was significantly higher than that of
      control. From these data, it is proposed that renal response to PTH in terms of
      25-hydroxyvitamin D3 hydroxylase stimulation involves dephosphorylation of
      renoredoxin, the ferrodoxin component of this hydroxylase complex.

TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of mRNA for mouse aspartate aminotransferase
      isoenzymes.
PG  - 16976-83
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of mRNAs for the mouse mitochondrial and cytosolic
      aspartate aminotransferase isoenzymes (mAspAT and cAspAT) (EC 2.6.1.1) were
      determined from complementary DNAs. The mAspAT mRNA comprises minimally 2460
      nucleotides and codes for a polypeptide of 430 amino acid residues corresponding 
      to the precursor form of the mAspAT (pre-mAspAT). The cAspAT mRNA comprises
      minimally 2086 nucleotides and codes for a polypeptide of 413 amino acid
      residues. The region coding for the mature mAspAT and that for the cAspAT show
      about 53% overall homology. The former shares 49% and the latter 48% of homology,
      respectively, with that of the Escherichia coli aspC gene, which has been shown
      to code for the E. coli AspAT (Kuramitsu, S., Okuno, S., Ogawa, T., Ogawa, H.,
      and Kagamiyama, H. (1985) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 97, 1259-1262). When the deduced
      amino acid sequence of the mouse pre-mAspAT was compared with that of the pig
      pre-mAspAT polypeptide, we found that they share a 94% homology and that the
      mouse pre-mAspAT yields a presequence consisting of 29 amino acid residues and a 
      mature mAspAT, consisting of 401 amino acid residues. These numbers and the amino
      acid residues present at the putative cleavage site are all in complete agreement
      in these two species. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse cAspAT shares 
      91% homology with that of the pig cAspAT. Comparisons of the nucleotide and
      deduced amino acid sequences between the mouse and E. coli AspATs suggest that
      the mammalian mAspAT gene is more closely related to the E. coli aspC gene than
      is the mammalian cAspAT gene.

TI  - Radiation inactivation of microsomal glutathione S-transferase.
PG  - 16963-8
AB  - Radiation inactivation analysis was used to determine the target size of rat
      liver microsomal glutathione S-transferase both in situ and following
      purification. When Tris-HCl-washed microsomes were irradiated, there was a
      1.5-2.0-fold increase in enzymatic activity over the first 3-6 megarads followed 
      by a decrease in enzymatic activity. Above 48 megarads the radiation inactivation
      curve of the Tris-HCl-washed microsomes was described by a monoexponential
      function which gave a target size of 48 kDa. The enzymatic activity of the
      microsomal enzyme was selectively increased by treating the Tris-HCl-washed
      microsomes either with N-ethylmaleimide or washing the microsomes with small
      unilamellar vesicles made from phosphatidylcholine. The inactivation curves
      obtained with both types of treated microsomes were simple monoexponential decays
      in enzymatic activity with target sizes of 46 kDa (N-ethylmaleimide) and 44 kDa
      (unilamellar vesicles). The microsomal enzyme was detergent solubilized and
      purified. The Mr value of the purified protein was 15,500 (sodium dodecyl
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). These data suggest that the
      functional unit of the microsomal form of glutathione S-transferase in situ is a 
      trimer. The target size of the purified enzyme solubilized in Triton X-100 was 85
      kDa, and no increase in activity was observed at the lower radiation doses. The
      increase in the target size of the purified enzyme could not be ascribed solely
      to the presence of the detergent. This result suggests that the microsomal form
      of this enzyme can exist as catalytically active oligomers of different sizes
      depending on its environment.

TI  - Mechanistic studies of lanosterol C-32 demethylation. Conditions which promote
      oxysterol intermediate accumulation during the demethylation process.
PG  - 16937-42
AB  - Conditions have been established which promote the accumulation of the
      dihydrolanosterol C-32 demethylation intermediates lanost-8-en-3 beta,32-diol and
      3 beta-hydroxylanost-8-en-32-aldehyde with intact hepatic microsomes.
      Accumulation of dihydrolanosterol-derived oxysterols occurs with a variety of
      assay manipulations which include short incubation times, limiting enzyme
      amounts, high pH, and increasing substrate concentration. In addition,
      competitive inhibition of dihydrolanosterol demethylation by lanosterol, or the
      reciprocal inhibition of lanosterol demethylation by dihydrolanosterol, leads to 
      oxysterol accumulation at the expense of demethylated end product. Similarly, the
      nonsteroidal demethylase inhibitors miconazole and ketoconazole promote oxysterol
      accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, cholesterol loading of
      isolated microsomes results in changes in the measured kinetic constants, Km and 
      Vmax, and results in enhanced oxysterol accumulation above that seen in control
      microsomal preparations. The major oxysterol intermediate accumulated under all
      the conditions described above is the C-32 aldehyde in an approximate 3:1 ratio
      to the C-32 alcohol. These data support the conclusion that a single enzyme
      species is responsible for all three oxidations of the C-32 demethylation
      sequence. In addition, intermediates which do not routinely accumulate during
      demethylation are freely diffusible from the enzyme when appropriate conditions
      are established to prevent their further metabolism.

TI  - Glucocorticoid-dependent expression of the albumin gene in adult rat hepatocytes.
PG  - 16883-8
AB  - In primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes, transcription of the albumin gene, 
      measured as incorporation of [alpha-32P]UTP into mRNA in isolated nuclei,
      decreased dramatically during culture without addition of serum and hormone,
      becoming almost negligible 10 h after plating. Of the hormones tested,
      dexamethasone (0.1 microM) prevented this decrease and restored the transcription
      within 2 h to the same level as that before culture. The half-maximum dose of
      dexamethasone for induction of transcription of the albumin gene was about 30 nM.
      The in vitro finding that expression of the albumin gene is strictly regulated by
      glucocorticoid was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in adrenalectomized rats
      showing that the transcription decreased markedly 14 days after adrenalectomy,
      but was restored rapidly by administration of hydrocortisone. This finding was
      also supported by identification of a glucocorticoid regulatory sequence from -50
      to -62 base pairs between the TATA box and CAT box upstream of the 5'-end of the 
      albumin gene. Cycloheximide inhibited the induction of transcription of the
      albumin gene by dexamethasone, suggesting that a rapidly induced mediator
      protein, which is also regulated by glucocorticoid, is involved in the induction 
      of albumin gene expression by glucocorticoid. The albumin gene was also regulated
      by various other hormones besides glucocorticoid. Glucagon markedly enhanced the 
      transcription induced by dexamethasone, although glucagon alone had no effect.
      Conversely, epinephrine suppressed stimulation of expression of the albumin gene 
      by dexamethasone. Insulin and triiodothyronine had no effect on transcription of 
      the albumin gene. From these findings we conclude that expression of the albumin 
      gene depends strictly on glucocorticoid, and this dependence is modulated by
      other hormones.

PG  - 16865-70
AB  - The cytochrome P-450-mediated reactions of the synthetic stilbene estrogen
      (E)-diethylstilbestrol (DES) and of 2-hydroxyestradiol have been investigated in 
      vitro. Depending on the cofactor used, microsomal enzymes catalyzed reductions
      and/or oxidations of the estrogens: Phenobarbital-induced rat liver microsomes
      catalyzed the oxidation of DES to 4',4"-diethylstilbestrol quinone (DES quinone) 
      with cumene hydroperoxide as cofactor. The quinone was unstable and spontaneously
      rearranged to (Z,Z)-dienestrol. DES quinone was reduced to a mixture of E- and
      Z-isomers of DES by NADPH catalyzed by purified cytochrome P-450 reductase. After
      rearrangement of the quinone to (Z,Z)-dienestrol, reduction reactions did not
      proceed. Rat liver microsomes and NADPH catalyzed the conversion of DES to
      (Z,Z)-dienestrol and (Z)-DES, but DES quinone could not be detected. The
      reactions described provide direct evidence for microsome-mediated redox cycling 
      of estrogens. Although DES quinone could not be detected in the incubation of
      DES, microsomes, and NADPH as cofactor, the intermediacy of the quinone is
      demonstrated by the formation of (Z,Z)-dienestrol, the marker product for
      oxidation. The quinone could not be detected because it was rapidly reduced to
      DES and its Z-isomer. Microsome-mediated redox cycling between 2-hydroxyestradiol
      and the corresponding quinone was also demonstrated. Using cumene hydroperoxide
      as cofactor, the oxidation to the quinone was favored, while with NADPH as
      cofactor the reduction to 2-hydroxyestradiol was preferred. It is postulated that
      microsome-mediated redox cycling of estrogens plays a role in hormonal
      carcinogenesis.

      Characterization and kinetic analysis in isolated soleus muscle and skeletal
      muscle cells in culture.
PG  - 16827-33
AB  - A self-regulatory mechanism of the glucose transport in rat skeletal muscle cells
      is described. In isolated rat soleus muscles and rat skeletal myocytes and
      myotubes in culture, pre-exposure to varying glucose concentrations modulated the
      rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Maximal uptake was observed at glucose
      concentrations below 3 mM. Between 2.5 and 4.0 mM glucose it was reduced by
      25-35%; further elevation of the glucose concentration resulted in a gradual
      decrease of the transport rate by approximately 2% for each millimolar glucose.
      The effect of glucose was time-dependent and fully reversible. Insulin rapidly
      increased the 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the soleus muscle; however, the insulin
      effect depended on the glucose concentration of the preincubation. Insulin was
      totally ineffective in muscles pre-exposed to 1.0-3.0 mM glucose, whereas its
      stimulatory action increased with increasing glucose concentrations above 4 mM.
      The effect of low glucose and insulin were not additive, and the maximal
      2-deoxyglucose uptake rates induced by both conditions were of identical
      magnitude. It is postulated that glucose may "up- and down-regulate" its
      transport by affecting the number of active glucose transporters in the plasma
      membrane, and that insulin exerts its stimulatory effect only when the
      extracellular glucose reaches a threshold concentration.

TI  - Amino acid sequence of rabbit cardiac troponin T.
PG  - 16795-810
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of the major isoform of rabbit cardiac troponin 
      T was determined by the application of manual and automated Edman degradation
      procedures to fragments generated by suitable chemical or proteolytic cleavages. 
      The protein has a polypeptide chain length of 276 amino acid residues, a Mr of
      32,881, is negatively charged at neutral pH, and must be encoded by a different
      structural gene than rabbit skeletal troponin T. A more basic isoform differs in 
      the NH2-terminal region by the replacement of 7 glutamic acid residues by neutral
      amino acids. Comparison of the sequence with that of rabbit skeletal troponin T
      shows close homology in those structural regions (residues 47-151 and 170-236 of 
      rabbit skeletal troponin T) previously implicated in interactions with
      tropomyosin, troponin I and troponin C and predicts similar secondary structural 
      features. In addition, the NH2- (16 residues) and COOH-terminal (10 residues)
      segments are homologous. In the cardiac protein, the regions of residues 17-46,
      152-169, and 237-249 (rabbit skeletal troponin T numbering scheme) show little
      similarity with the skeletal protein and include multiple amino acid differences 
      as well as insertions and/or deletions. Within these nonhomologous segments,
      however, there are regions of high similarity or identity with the amino acid
      sequence of chicken cardiac troponin T deduced from DNA sequencing (Cooper, T.A.,
      and Ordahl, C.P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11140-11148). These include residues 
      36-46, 152-161, and 237-242 and may represent regions of functional importance
      for cardiac troponin T as compared with the skeletal protein.

PG  - 16785-7
AB  - Four narrow lines are observed in the high-resolution cross-polarization
      magic-angle spinning 13C NMR spectra of intact, lyophilized samples of
      Pseudomonas sp. LBr, in addition to the broader lines normally associated with
      bacterial cellular material. These narrow lines arise from
      poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate). The cellular carbon contained in this storage
      material can be measured quantitatively and nondestructively from the solid-state
      NMR spectra. We find that cells starved for phosphorus store up to 50% of their
      total carbon as poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate). When such cells are used to inoculate
      medium containing a source of phosphorus, all of the poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate)
      is metabolized by the time the culture has reached midlogarithmic growth phase.

TI  - Fasting and refeeding alter the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in chicken liver
      but fail to affect brain insulin receptors.
PG  - 17081-8
AB  - Insulin receptors from chicken liver and brain were studied following alterations
      in the nutritional state. Chickens were either fasted for 48 h, fasted for 48 h
      and then refed for 24 h, or fed a regular diet ad libitum. 125I-Porcine insulin
      binding was significantly elevated in liver membranes from the fasted animals and
      lowered in refed chickens when compared to preparations from ad libitum fed
      chickens. These changes in 125I-insulin binding were inversely related to the
      levels of plasma insulin and since receptor affinities for insulin were similar
      in each group, they probably represent alterations in receptor number. Apparent
      Mr of alpha subunits of the insulin receptors was unaffected by alterations in
      the nutritional states. The presence of ATPase-like activities that co-eluted
      with liver insulin receptors from wheat germ agglutinin lectin columns but not
      from pea lectin columns necessitated the use of both pea and wheat germ
      agglutinin for liver insulin receptor purification. The insulin receptors
      purified from both lectin columns were recognized by anti-insulin receptor
      antiserum and had similar affinities for insulin which were unaltered by the
      nutritional state. Insulin-stimulatable autophosphorylation of the beta subunit
      of the insulin receptor was lower in livers from fasted chickens and intermediate
      in refed chickens. Furthermore, basal and insulin-induced phosphorylation of the 
      artificial substrate poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 was significantly less in the fasting
      state and intermediate in the refed state compared to the ad libitum fed state.
      Insulin sensitivity (measured as the dose of insulin required for 50% maximal
      stimulation of kinase activity) was similar in all three states suggesting that
      the differences in insulin-induced phosphorylation are due to a change in maximal
      stimulation and not a change in insulin sensitivity. In contrast to the
      alterations seen with liver receptors, brain insulin receptors were unaffected by
      these alterations in nutritional state. These findings suggest that: liver
      insulin receptors are affected by altering the nutritional state; insulin binding
      to liver membranes is inversely related to plasma insulin levels; and tyrosine
      kinase is decreased both in fasted and refed animals suggesting an uncoupling of 
      the normal interaction between alpha subunit and beta subunit in liver insulin
      receptors.

      sequence followed by a 59-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension. A 56-amino acid
      peptide within this extension has been shown to stimulate gonadotropin release,
      and this activity has been localized to its amino-terminal region. A series of
      seven overlapping peptide fragments corresponding to the first 24 amino acids of 
      the carboxyl-extension of the GnRH precursor were synthesized and tested for
      their ability to stimulate luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
      release from cultured human anterior pituitary cells. All active peptide
      fragments were found to incorporate the decapeptide sequence
      Asn-Leu-Ile-Asp-Ser-Phe-Gln-Glu-Ile-Val which is regarded as a minimal structural
      requirement delineated for gonadotropin-releasing activity. A further flanking
      sequence extending this active region from its carboxyl terminus was found to
      enhance gonadotropin-releasing activity although the flanking sequence itself was
      inactive. The gonadotropin release stimulated by the active peptides wa shown to 
      be a dose- dependent, specific, and calcium-dependent phenomenon which occurred
      independently of the GnRH receptor on the pituitary gonadotrophs as a GnRH
      antagonist did not inhibit activity.

TI  - Yeast metallothionein function in metal ion detoxification.
PG  - 16895-900
AB  - A genetic approach was taken to test the function of yeast metallothionein in
      metal ion detoxification. A yeast strain was constructed in which the
      metallothionein locus was deleted (cup1 delta). The cup1 delta strain was
      complemented with normal or mutant metallothionein genes under normal or
      constitutive regulatory control on high copy episomal plasmids. Metal resistance 
      of the cup1 delta strain with and without the metallothionein-expressing vectors 
      was analyzed. The normally regulated metallothionein gene conferred resistance
      only to copper (1000-fold); constitutively expressed metallothionein conferred
      resistance to both copper (500-fold) and cadmium (1000-fold), but not to mercury,
      zinc, silver, cobalt, nickel, gold, platinum, lanthanum, uranium, or tin. Two
      mutant versions of the metallothionein gene were constructed and tested for their
      ability to confer metal resistance in the cup1 delta background. The first had a 
      deletion of a highly conserved amino acid sequence (Lys-Lys-Ser-Cys-Cys-Ser). The
      second was a hybrid gene consisting of the sequences coding for the first 20
      amino acids of the yeast protein fused to the monkey metallothionein gene.
      Expression of these genes under the CUP1 promoter provided significant protection
      from copper, but none of the other metals tested. These results demonstrate that 
      there is significant flexibility in the structural requirements for
      metallothionein to function in copper detoxification and that yeast
      metallothionein is also capable of detoxifying cadmium under conditions of
      constitutive expression.

PG  - 17089-98
AB  - The effects of phorbol esters, dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), and micromolar Ca2+ on 
      protein phosphorylation and catecholamine secretion in digitonin-treated
      chromaffin cells were investigated. [gamma-32P]ATP was used as a substrate for
      phosphorylation in the permeabilized cells. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 
      (TPA) enhanced Ca2+-dependent catecholamine secretion from
      digitonin-permeabilized cells. The enhancement required MgATP. Only those phorbol
      esters which activate protein kinase C in vitro enhanced both catecholamine
      secretion and protein phosphorylation. DiC8, which activates protein kinase C in 
      vitro and mimics phorbol ester effects in situ, also enhanced both catecholamine 
      secretion and protein phosphorylation. Preincubation of intact cells with TPA or 
      DiC8 was necessary for maximal effects on both catecholamine secretion and
      protein phosphorylation in subsequently digitonin-treated chromaffin cells. The
      TPA-induced enhancement of protein phosphorylation was almost entirely
      Ca2+-independent, whereas DiC8-induced enhancement of protein phosphorylation was
      mainly Ca2+-dependent. Micromolar Ca2+ alone also enhanced the phosphorylation of
      a large number of proteins. Most of the proteins phosphorylated in response to
      TPA or potentiated by DiC8 in combination with Ca2+ were also phosphorylated by
      micromolar Ca2+ in the absence of exogenous protein kinase C activators. In
      intact cells, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) induced Ca2+-dependent
      phosphorylation of at least 17 proteins which were detected by two-dimensional
      gel electrophoresis. All of the proteins phosphorylated upon incubation with
      1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium were phosphorylated upon incubation with
      micromolar Ca2+ in digitonin-treated cells. These results demonstrate that TPA-
      or DiC8-enhanced Ca2+-dependent catecholamine secretion is associated with
      enhanced protein phosphorylation which is probably mediated by protein kinase C
      and that activation of protein kinase C modulates catecholamine secretion from
      digitonin-treated chromaffin cells.

TI  - Three activators of protein kinase C, bryostatins, dioleins, and phorbol esters, 
      show differing specificities of action on GH4 pituitary cells.
PG  - 17073-80
AB  - Phorbol ester tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA)
      activate the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C and enhance
      three biological responses (prolactin release, prolactin synthesis, and cell
      stretching) in GH4C5 rat pituitary cells. We have examined several actions on
      GH4C5 cells of TPA and two other classes of protein kinase C activators,
      synthetic cell permeant dioleins and bryostatins isolated from the marine
      bryozoan Bugula neritina. Bryostatins 1 and 2 (B1 and B2, respectively) competed 
      for [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding to the protein kinase C complex in
      intact cells nearly equipotently with TPA. B1 and B2, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol
      (OAG) and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (Di8) as well as TPA each activated partially
      purified protein kinase C from GH4C5 cells. B1, B2, and TPA each enhanced the
      acute release of prolactin from GH4C5 cells to a similar maximal extent. B1, B2, 
      and TPA also enhanced prolactin synthesis. However, B1 and B2 were only partial
      agonists because they enhanced prolactin synthesis to a lesser maximal extent
      than did TPA and, given in combination, they reduced TPA-enhanced prolactin
      synthesis. OAG and Di8 stimulated prolactin release (to a lesser maximal extent
      than TPA) and did not stimulate prolactin synthesis. Pretreatment with OAG did
      not reduce TPA-stimulated prolactin release or synthesis. B2 and TPA induced cell
      stretching in GH4C5 cells, whereas B1, OAG, and Di8 induced little if any
      stretching. B1, but not B2, given in combination with TPA antagonized TPA-induced
      stretching but did not reduce thyrotropin-releasing hormone- or epidermal growth 
      factor-induced stretching. We conclude that the bryostatins, phorbol esters, and 
      dioleins bind to the same site on the protein kinase C complex to activate the
      enzyme, but they alter three biological responses in GH4C5 cells with
      selectivities and efficacies that differ. We propose that different activators of
      protein kinase C (such as bryostatins, dioleins, and phorbol esters) may elicit
      different cellular responses by altering the substrate specificity or activating 
      multiple forms of the kinase.

TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel low molecular weight form of
      single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator.
PG  - 17120-6
AB  - A low Mr form (Mr 32,000) of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator
      (scu-PA) was isolated from conditioned culture medium of a human lung
      adenocarcinoma cell line, CALU-3 (ATCC, HTB-55). The purified material
      (scu-PA-32k) consists of a single polypeptide chain and is immunologically
      similar to Mr 33,000 urokinase. Its NH2-terminal sequence is identical to that
      beginning at Leu-144 of Mr 54,000 urokinase. Whereas low Mr urokinase is derived 
      from mature Mr 54,000 scu-PA by limited hydrolysis by plasmin first of the
      Lys-158-Ile-159 peptide bond and then of the Lys-136-Lys-137, scu-PA-32k is
      generated by specific hydrolysis of the Glu-143-Leu-144 peptide bond by an
      unidentified protease. scu-PA-32k resembles its Mr 54,000 scu-PA counterpart by
      its very low activity on chromogenic substrates for urokinase, by
      plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates, and by the lack of 
      specific binding to fibrin. It activates plasminogen directly with high affinity,
      Km = 0.9 microM, but low turnover number, kcat = 0.0028 s-1. It is converted to
      fully active two-chain urokinase by plasmin with Km = 12 microM and kcat = 0.3
      s-1. Like Mr 54,000 scu-PA, it causes significant lysis of a 125I-labeled fibrin 
      clot in human plasma with relatively less fibrinogen breakdown as compared to
      urokinase. scu-PA-32k, which also has conserved fibrin specificity, represents a 
      molecular variant which may be more suitable for large scale production as a
      fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent by recombinant DNA technology.

TI  - Thermodynamics of the binding of AMP to glycogen phosphorylase a.
PG  - 17067-72
AB  - The binding of AMP to rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase a (EC 2.4.1.1.) has
      been studied by equilibrium dialysis and isothermal microcalorimetry at pH 6.9
      over a temperature range of 25 degrees C to 35 degrees C. Thermal titration
      experiments were carried out in various buffer systems. We have found by these
      methods that a certain number of protons are released when the protein binds to
      the ligand and are taken up by the buffer. The tetramer of phosphorylase a has
      been shown to have four equal and independent, non-cooperative binding sites for 
      AMP at 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C; these sites can be assigned 
      to the so-called nucleotide or, activator, sites in the protein. The binding
      constants together with the changes in Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy per
      site for the AMP binding were calculated at each temperature. A negative delta Cp
      value of -2.3 +/- 0.2 J K-1 (AMP bound)-1 was obtained for this binding process. 
      The hydrophobic and vibrational contributions of the heat capacity and entropy
      changes have been resolved by the method described by Sturtevant (Sturtevant, J. 
      M. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 2236-2240). From this analysis, it 
      appears that the binding is, in all cases, enthalpy-driven, the two entropic
      contributions, hydrophobic and vibrational, having opposing effects.

TI  - Stereospecific induction of starfish oocyte maturation by
      (8R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid.
PG  - 17040-7
AB  - Oocyte maturation (meiosis reinitiation) in starfish is induced by the natural
      hormone 1-methyladenine. This induction of meiotic divisions can be triggered
      also by four fatty acids: 5,8,11-20:3; 5,8,11,14-20:4 (arachidonic acid);
      6,9,12,15-20:4; 5,8,11,14,17-20:5, all other fatty acids being completely
      inactive. This maturation triggered by eicosanoids occurs in the micromolar range
      and is facilitated by the presence of calcium. A variety of arachidonic acid
      derivatives (esters, epoxides, etc.) and metabolites (cyclooxygenase and
      lipoxygenase products) has been tested; the biological activity is restricted to 
      8-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8-HETE), other mono- and poly-HETEs being
      completely inactive. Maturation triggered by 8-HETE occurs around 10 nM and is
      insensitive to the presence of calcium. 8-HETE methyl ester and
      8-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid are able to induce maturation at higher
      concentrations. Both (8S) and (8R) stereoisomers have been tested; the biological
      activity is strictly restricted to the (8R) isomer. 8-HETE triggers a complete
      maturation, i.e. maturation-promoting factor appearance, germinal vesicle
      breakdown, emission of the polar bodies, and formation of a female pronucleus.
      (8R)-HETE, but not (8S)-HETE, triggers the typical decrease in cyclic AMP
      concentration induced by 1-methyladenine and the burst of protein phosphorylation
      associated with maturation. Starfish oocytes oxidize exogenous arachidonic acid
      into 8-HETE and other HETEs. 8-HETE was identified, after high pressure liquid
      chromatography purification, by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.
      Furthermore, it was found that the starfish oocytes only produce the (8R)-HETE
      isomer. This highly stereospecific induction of oocyte maturation by (8R)-HETE
      suggests that this fatty acid, or a very closely related fatty acid, may play a
      role in the transduction of the 1-methyladenine message at the plasma membrane
      level.

TI  - Oxidative inactivation of the enzyme rhodanese by reduced nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide.
PG  - 16953-6
AB  - The enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase; EC 2.8.1.1) is inactivated
      with a half-time of approximately 3 min when incubated with 50 mM NADH. NAD+,
      however, has virtually no effect on the activity. Inactivation can be prevented
      by the inclusion of the substrate thiosulfate. The concentration of thiosulfate
      giving half-protection is 0.038 mM. In addition, NADH, but not NAD+, is a
      competitive inhibitor with respect to thiosulfate in the catalyzed reaction (Ki =
      8.3 mM). Fluorescence studies are consistent with a time-dependent oxidation of
      NADH in the presence of rhodanese. The sulfur-free form of rhodanese is more
      rapidly inactivated than the sulfur-containing form. Spectrophotometric
      titrations show that inactivation is accompanied by the loss of two free SH
      groups per enzyme molecule. Inactivation is prevented by the exclusion of air and
      the inclusion of EDTA (1 mM), and the enzyme activity can be largely protected by
      incubation with superoxide dismutase or catalase. Rhodanese, inactivated with
      NADH, can be reactivated by incubation with the substrate thiosulfate (75 mM) for
      48 h or more rapidly, but only partially, by incubating with 180 mM
      dithiothreitol. It is concluded that, in the presence of rhodanese, NADH can be
      oxidized by molecular oxygen and produce intermediates of oxygen reduction, such 
      as superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide, that can inactivate the enzyme with
      consequent formation of an intraprotein disulfide. In addition, NADH, but not
      NAD+, can reversibly bind to the active site region in competition with
      thiosulfate. These data are of interest in view of x-ray studies that show
      structural similarities between rhodanese and nucleotide binding proteins.

TI  - Sizes of Mn-binding sites in spinach thylakoids.
PG  - 16923-6
AB  - The sizes of the Mn-binding sites in spinach thylakoids were estimated by target 
      size analysis, assaying the membrane-bound Mn that was resistant to EDTA washing 
      after radiation inactivation. The inactivation curve showed well the inactivation
      of two independent Mn-binding sites of different sizes: about two-thirds of the
      Mn coordinated to a binding site of 65 kDa, and the rest bound to a much smaller 
      site of only about 3 kDa. In the large site, there was about 1 g atom of Mn/110
      mol of chlorophyll in spinach thylakoids, which was constant in normally grown
      plants, although the Mn level in the small site depended on culture conditions.
      Thylakoids that had been incubated with hydroxylamine or in 0.8 M Tris lost Mn
      exclusively from the large binding site.

TI  - Liver isozyme of rabbit glycogen synthase. Amino acid sequences surrounding
      phosphorylation sites recognized by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.
PG  - 16909-15
AB  - Glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen biosynthesis, has been
      postulated to exist as isozymes in rabbit liver and muscle (Camici, M., Ahmad,
      Z., DePaoli-Roach, A. A., and Roach, P. J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2466-2473).
      Both isozymes share a number of properties including multiple phosphorylation of 
      the enzyme subunit. In the present study, we determined the amino acid sequences 
      surrounding phosphorylation sites in the rabbit liver isozyme recognized by
      cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Two dominant phosphopeptides (P-1 and P-2)
      were generated from tryptic digestion. Amino acid sequences of the purified
      peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation using a gas-phase
      sequenator. The locations of phosphorylated residues were identified by measuring
      32Pi release during Edman degradation cycles. The NH2-terminal sequence of
      peptide P-1 is S-L-S(P)-V-T-S-L-G-G-L-P-Q-W-E-V-E-E-L-P-V-D-D-L-L-L-P-E-V. This
      sequence exhibits a strong homology to the site 2 region in the NH2 terminus of
      the muscle isozyme. The NH2-terminal sequence of peptide P-2 is
      M-Y-P-R-P-S(P)-S(P)-V-P-P-S-P-L-G-S-Q-A. This sequence shows strong homology to
      the site 3 region in the COOH terminus of the muscle isozyme. However, some
      interesting sequence differences were revealed in this region. For example,
      substitution of serine for alanine at position 6 of peptide P-2 created a new
      phosphorylation site for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of 
      the proline/serine-rich site 3 region correlated with inactivation of the liver
      isozyme and suggests an important role for this segment of the molecule in the
      regulation of glycogen synthase. No phosphorylation sites corresponding to sites 
      1a and 1b of the muscle isozyme were detected. In addition, the results provide
      definitive chemical proof that glycogen synthase from rabbit liver and muscle are
      isozymes encoded by distinct messages.

TI  - Role of ascorbic acid in dopamine beta-hydroxylation. The endogenous enzyme
      cofactor and putative electron donor for cofactor regeneration.
PG  - 16901-8
AB  - The role(s) of ascorbic acid in dopamine beta-hydroxylation was studied in
      primary cultures of bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells and in isolated
      bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin vesicles. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity
      was assessed by measuring the rate of conversion of tyramine to octopamine. The
      ascorbic acid content of chromaffin cells declined with time in culture and the
      dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity of ascorbate-depleted cells was low. Ascorbate
      additions to ascorbate-depleted cells increased both the intracellular ascorbate 
      concentrations and the rates of dopamine beta-hydroxylation. Ascorbate uptake
      into the cells was rapid; however, the onset of enhanced octopamine synthesis by 
      added ascorbate was delayed by several hours and closely followed the time course
      for accumulation of the newly taken up ascorbate into the chromaffin vesicle. The
      amount of octopamine synthesized by the chromaffin cells exceeded the
      intracellular ascorbate content and ascorbate levels were maintained during
      dopamine beta-hydroxylation in the absence of external ascorbate. This suggests
      an efficient recycling of ascorbate. In contrast to intact cells, ascorbic acid
      was depleted during octopamine synthesis in isolated chromaffin vesicles. The
      molar ratio of octopamine formed to ascorbate depleted was close to unity. Thus, 
      the recycling of intravesicular ascorbate depends on an extravesicular factor(s).
      The depletion of intravesicular ascorbate during dopamine beta-hydroxylation was 
      prevented by the addition of nonpermeant extravesicular electron donors such as
      ascorbate or glucoascorbate. This suggests that intravesicular ascorbate is
      maintained in the reduced state by electron transport across the vesicle
      membrane. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that both intra- and
      extravesicular ascorbate participate in the regulation of dopamine
      beta-hydroxylase. Intravesicular ascorbate is the cofactor for the enzyme.
      Cytosolic ascorbate is most likely the electron donor for the vesicle-membrane
      electron transport system which maintains the intravesicular cofactor
      concentration.

TI  - A Drosophila heat shock locus with a rapidly diverging sequence but a conserved
      structure.
PG  - 16889-94
AB  - Cytological studies have shown that the heat shock loci 93D of Drosophila
      melanogaster and 2-48B of Drosophila hydei have several characteristics which
      suggest that they are homologous loci, yet sequence homology is barely detectable
      by cross-hybridization. Using cloned DNA sequences we have compared the two loci.
      Both loci produce transcripts of similar size and number. We have characterized
      the three predominant transcripts. In each species all three transcripts start at
      or about the same place within the unique portion of the gene. The longest
      transcript (approximately 9-10 kilobases) continues through several kilobases of 
      short tandem repeats. The two shorter (1.9 and 1.2 kilobases) transcripts
      terminate 5' to the repeats. The repeat sequences are strongly conserved within a
      species but between species they have diverged both in length and in sequence.
      The longest homology is 9 nucleotides. The unique portions have also diverged
      significantly but do have some regions of conserved sequence. In both species the
      cytoplasmic transcript is spliced and polyadenylated but does not appear to
      contain a significant open reading frame. Thus, although the sequence of this
      locus has diverged significantly there are conserved features which suggest that 
      the function of the locus is also conserved.

      2(I) procollagen subunits in 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-transformed fibroblasts.
PG  - 16818-26
AB  - The collagen phenotype of a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-transformed line of Syrian
      hamster embryo fibroblasts, NQT-SHE, was markedly altered from that of normal
      Syrian hamster embryo cells, which synthesized mainly type I procollagen
      [pro-alpha 1(I)]2 pro-alpha 2(I). Total collagen synthesis in the transformant
      was reduced to about 30% of the control level primarily because synthesis of the 
      pro-alpha 1(I) subunit was completely suppressed. The major collagenous products 
      synthesized consisted of two polypeptides, designated as N-33 and N-50, which
      could be completely separated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 33 and
      50% saturation, respectively. N-33 migrated similarly to pro-alpha 2(I) on sodium
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and N-50 migrated slightly
      more slowly. The collagenous regions of these chains were more sensitive to
      protease than the analogous region of procollagen I, but alpha-chains could be
      obtained by digestion for 2 h at 4 degrees C with high ratios of protein:pepsin. 
      Staphylococcus V8 protease and cyanogen bromide peptide maps of N-33 alpha and
      N-50 alpha chains indicated that the chains were homologous with, but different
      than, alpha 2(I) chains and that they differed from each other. Considering their
      similarity to pro-alpha 2(I), it was surprising to find that the N-collagens were
      secreted to the same extent as was type I procollagen from Syrian hamster embryo 
      cells and that there were no disulfide bonds between N-collagen chains.
      Intrachain disulfides were present. One possible explanation for the unusual
      collagen phenotype of NQT-SHE cells is that transformation induced one or more
      mutations in the pro-alpha 2(I) structural gene while suppression of synthesis of
      the pro-alpha 1(I) subunit may be due to a mutation in the regulatory region of
      its gene or in a general regulatory gene.

TI  - Anchimeric assistance in the intramolecular reaction of
      glucose-dehydrogenase-polyethylene glycol NAD conjugate.
PG  - 16792-4
AB  - Polyethylene glycol-bound derivatives of NAD(P) (PEG-NAD(P)) are water-soluble
      macromolecular coenzymes used in continuous enzyme reactors. These NAD(P)
      derivatives have good coenzyme activity for many dehydrogenases, but some enzymes
      such as glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.47) show very low activity with these
      derivatives (less than 0.1% of that for native NAD(P)). In this work, we prepared
      a covalently linked glucose-dehydrogenase-polyethylene glycol-NAD conjugate
      (GlcDH-PEG-NAD) and found that the conjugate shows a much higher reaction rate
      than that of the native enzyme plus PEG-NAD: the ratio of the reaction rates of
      GlcDH-PEG-NAD and the native enzyme plus PEG-NAD is calculated to be 10,000-fold 
      at the concentrations of the enzyme subunit and NAD moiety of 0.31 and 0.65
      microM, respectively; the rate of the conjugate is even higher than that of the
      native enzyme plus native NAD. This rate acceleration is due to the increase in
      the effective concentration of NAD moiety ("anchimeric assistance") and
      demonstrates the potential of covalent linking for improving the interaction
      between an enzyme and a coenzyme derivative.

TI  - COX8, the structural gene for yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. DNA
      sequence and gene disruption indicate that subunit VIII is required for maximal
      levels of cellular respiration and is derived from a precursor which is extended 
      at both its NH2 and COOH termini.
PG  - 17192-7
AB  - From the amino acid sequence of yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII published
      previously (Power, S. D., Lochrie, M.A., Patterson, T.E., and Poyton, R.C. (1984)
      J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6571-6574), we have synthesized a pair of oligonucleotide
      probes and used them to identify COX8, its structural gene. By genomic Southern
      blot analysis and disruption of the COX8 chromosomal locus, we have shown that
      this gene is present in one copy per haploid genome and that its product, subunit
      VIII, is essential for maximal levels of cellular respiration and cytochrome c
      oxidase activity. Alignment of the amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA
      sequence of COX8 with the determined amino acid sequence of subunit VIII
      indicates that mature subunit VIII is derived from a larger precursor that
      extends from both the NH2 and COOH termini of the mature polypeptide. Thus, like 
      many other nuclear coded mitochondrial proteins, subunit VIII is derived from a
      precursor which carries a leader peptide. In addition, this precursor, like that 
      for yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa, appears to carry a four-amino acid
      "trailer peptide" at its COOH terminus.

TI  - Characterization of COX9, the nuclear gene encoding the yeast mitochondrial
      protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa. Subunit VIIa lacks a leader peptide
      and is an essential component of the holoenzyme.
PG  - 17183-91
AB  - The gene COX9 for subunit VIIa of cytochrome c oxidase from Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae has been cloned with the aid of an oligonucleotide probe. From the
      nucleotide sequence of COX9, we deduce that subunit VIIa is derived from a
      precursor that is 59 amino acids in length (Mr = 6963). This precursor is longer 
      than mature subunit VIIa by one amino acid at its NH2 terminus and four amino
      acids at its COOH terminus. COX9 exists as a single copy in the haploid genome of
      S. cerevisiae and produces one major transcript. When the genomic copy of COX9 is
      removed, cells lack a functional cytochrome c oxidase holoenzyme. From the
      predicted secondary structure of subunit VIIa, previous data concerning its
      relationship to the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane and the location of its
      hydrophobic domains (Power, S.D., Lochrie, M.A., and Poyton, R.O. (1986) J. Biol.
      Chem. 261, 9206-9209) and the finding that it is essential for the holoenzyme, we
      propose a model for subunit VIIa which suggests that this small integral protein 
      plays a role in holoenzyme assembly or stability.

PG  - 17163-9
AB  - The respiratory deficiency of yeast strains previously assigned to
      complementation group G7 has been ascribed to the absence in the mutants of
      functional cytochrome b. Since G7 mutants are capable of synthesizing the
      apoprotein, the primary effect of the mutations is to prevent maturation of this 
      electron carrier. The recombinant plasmid pG7/T1 with a 6.7-kilobase pairs (kb)
      insert of wild type yeast nuclear DNA has been selected from a genomic library by
      transformation of a G7 mutant to respiratory competency. The genetically active
      region of the pG7/T1 insert has been subcloned on a 3-kb fragment of DNA which
      has been shown to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein of 50,236 Mr. 
      In situ disruption of the reading frame causes a deficiency in cytochrome b. The 
      strain with the disrupted gene fails to complement G7 mutants thereby confirming 
      the correct identification of the gene henceforth referred to as COR1. The
      carboxyl-terminal half of the COR1 gene has been fused to the amino-terminal half
      of the Escherichia coli trpE gene in the high expression vector pATH2. This
      plasmid construct promotes a high level of expression of the trpE/COR1 hybrid
      protein. Antibodies against the purified hybrid protein react with a 44 kDa
      protein subunit of yeast coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase corresponding to the
      largest core subunit of the complex. These data indicate that the yeast nuclear
      gene COR1 codes for the 44-kDa core protein and that the latter is required for
      the conversion of apocytochrome b to mature cytochrome b.

TI  - Structure and expression of the rat insulin-like growth factor II (rIGF-II) gene.
      rIGF-II RNAs are transcribed from two promoters.
PG  - 17138-49
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is a mitogenic polypeptide present in rat 
      plasma at high levels during fetal and early postnatal life and is believed to
      play an important, although as yet undefined, role in fetal development. Both in 
      humans and rats, expression of the IGF-II gene results in the appearance of
      several mRNA species. In the present study, cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotide
      probes were used to isolate and characterize the rat IGF-II gene from genomic
      libraries. The rat IGF-II gene extends over 12 kilobase pairs and contains two
      5'-noncoding exons and three protein-coding exons. The two 5' exons represent
      alternative 5' regions of different mRNA molecules and are expressed from two
      distinct promoters. The two promoters are transcribed with different efficiencies
      but exhibit similar tissue-specific expression and regulation with developmental 
      age.

PG  - 17113-9
AB  - The ompB locus, comprised of the genes ompR and envZ, regulates the expression of
      the genes ompF and ompC that encode the major porin proteins in the outer
      membrane of Escherichia coli K-12. OmpR is believed to activate transcription of 
      ompF and ompC in a reciprocal manner depending upon the osmolarity of the culture
      medium. We were able to purify OmpR to homogeneity and to characterize its
      interaction with the porin gene promoters. The purified OmpR was shown to bind
      specifically to promoter fragments of both ompF and ompC. Deoxyribonuclease I
      footprinting was carried out in order to determine binding sites of OmpR in the
      promoter regions of the ompF and ompC. OmpR was found to protect the regions -105
      to -60 of ompF and -102 to -78 of ompC, respectively. Two consensus sequences
      were found in these protected sites and are likely to play an important role in
      OmpR recognition of these promoter regions. The purified OmpR was also shown to
      be functionally active in transcription in vitro; OmpR activates the expression
      of ompF and inhibits the transcription of ompC from the most distal of its three 
      tandem promoters, P3.

TI  - Cytochrome aa3 from Nitrosomonas europaea.
PG  - 17048-56
AB  - Cytochrome c oxidase has been purified from the ammonia oxidizing chemoautotroph 
      Nitrosomonas europaea by ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of Triton
      X-100. The enzyme has absorption maxima at 420 and 592 nm in the resting state
      and at 444 and 598 nm in the dithionite-reduced form; optical extinction
      coefficient (598 nm minus 640 nm) = 21.9 cm-1 nM-1. The enzyme has approximately 
      11 nmol of heme a and approximately 11 nmol of copper per mg of protein (Lowry
      procedure). There appear to be three subunits (approximate molecular weights
      50,800, 38,400, and 35,500), two heme groups (a and a3), and two copper atoms per
      minimal unit. The EPR spectra of the resting and partially reduced enzyme are
      remarkably similar to the corresponding spectra of the mitochondrial cytochrome
      aa3-type oxidase. Although the enzyme had been previously classified as
      "cytochrome a1" on the basis of its ferrous alpha absorption maximum (598 nm),
      its metal content and EPR spectral properties clearly show that it is better
      classified as a cytochrome aa3. Neither the data reported here nor a review of
      the literature supports the existence of cytochrome a1 as an entity discrete from
      cytochrome aa3. The purified enzyme is reduced rapidly by ferrous horse heart
      cytochrome c or cytochrome c-554 from N. europaea, but not with cytochrome c-552 
      from N. europaea. The identity of the natural electron donor is as yet
      unestablished. With horse heart cytochrome c as electron donor, the purified
      enzyme could account for a significant portion of the terminal oxidase activity
      in vivo.

      also added (Britigan, B. E., Rosen, G. M., Chai, Y., and Cohen, M. S. (1986) J.
      Biol. Chem. 261, 4426-4431). Even then, .OH formation wanes in spite of ongoing
      superoxide (O2-.) production. In contrast, ferric salt supplementation of a
      hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase O2-. generating system containing DETAPAC produces 
      continual .OH, suggesting that neutrophils limit the formation of this free
      radical. To evaluate this hypothesis, neutrophil cytoplasts (largely devoid of
      granules but able to generate O2-.) were stimulated with PMA in the presence of
      Fe3+, DETAPAC, dimethyl sulfoxide, and DMPO. This resulted in continual
      production of DMPO-CH3. In the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, HL-60
      (promyelocytic) cells differentiate into cells similar in morphology and O2-.
      generating capacity to neutrophils. However, their granules lack the iron-binding
      protein lactoferrin (LF). Ferric salt supplementation of HL-60 cells stimulated
      with PMA yielded an EPR spectrum similar to cytoplasts. Supernatant obtained
      following PMA-induced neutrophil degranulation (which releases LF
      extracellularly) suppressed DMPO-CH3 formation by the hypoxanthine/xanthine
      oxidase/Fe3+/DETAPAC system. Anti-LF antibody, but not anti-transferrin antibody,
      prevented stimulated neutrophil supernatant inhibition of hypoxanthine/xanthine
      oxidase/Fe3+/DETAPAC-mediated .OH formation. Similarly, neutrophils stimulated
      with PMA in the presence of Fe3+, DETAPAC, and anti-LF antibody (but not
      anti-transferrin antibody) demonstrated continual formation of .OH. Neutrophil
      degranulation of LF limits Fe3+-catalyzed .OH formation which in vivo could
      protect tissue from possible .OH-mediated injury.

      conversion of estrogen receptors from nonsteroid binding to the lower affinity
      binding state.
PG  - 17018-25
AB  - Two steroid binding states of an estrogen receptor each with different
      equilibrium constants (Kd values) Rx (Kd = 0.06 nM) and Ry (Kd = 0.8 nM) have
      been identified and characterized in the hen and estrogen-stimulated chick
      oviduct. A third nonestrogen binding form of the receptor, designated Rnb, is now
      described which exists in short-term estrogen withdrawn chick oviduct cytosol. A 
      model is presented in which the receptor can be interconverted between the three 
      states. The interconversion is monitored by Scatchard analysis, sucrose density
      gradient analysis, and affinity labeling using [3H]tamoxifen aziridine followed
      by receptor purification with estrogen receptor monoclonal antibody affinity
      chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The results are
      consistent with each state existing in different conformations having a common
      molecular weight of approximately 66,000. This paper defines the conditions and
      nucleotide requirements for the Rnb to Ry conversion. The conversion to the
      steroid binding form is induced by ATP, ADP, and GTP. Cyclic nucleotides are
      ineffective. There is a specific requirement for Mg2+; neither Ca2+ nor Mn2+ will
      substitute. Nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogues were tested for their relative
      efficiency to convert Rnb to Ry. Conversion occurred with alpha,beta-methylene
      adenosine triphosphate, but beta,gamma-methylene adenosine triphosphate and
      alpha,beta-methylene adenosine diphosphate were inert. Thus, activation of Rnb to
      form Ry appears to be catalyzed by an event requiring the loss of the terminal
      phosphoryl moiety from either ATP or ADP. Receptor derived from conversion of Rnb
      to Ry has the same physical properties as native Ry. Activation of Rnb is to Ry
      specifically; no increase in the Rx form of estrogen receptor was ever observed. 
      The accompanying paper similarly describes the Rx to Ry conversion. Since these
      data also explain observations made with glucocorticoid and with epidermal growth
      factor receptors, it is speculated that the receptor interconversion model may
      have general application to hormone action.

TI  - Receptor interconversion model of hormone action. I. ATP-mediated conversion of
      estrogen receptors from a high to lower affinity state and its relationship to
      antiestrogen action.
PG  - 17011-7
AB  - We have previously reported that the estrogen receptor exists in three distinct
      states in the oviduct of the estrogen-treated chick. Since two of these forms
      bind estrogen and possess a number of similar properties, the intrinsic
      relationship between these two receptor forms has been investigated. We now show 
      that a quantitative conversion of the high affinity (Rx) to the lower affinity
      (Ry) state can be induced by mild heating (30 degrees C) in the presence of
      estradiol and ATP, or the synthetic analogue alpha,beta-methylene adenosine
      triphosphate and the divalent cation Mg2+. Other nucleotides, including ADP, GTP,
      CTP, cAMP, and cGMP, as well as the nonhydrolyzable analogues
      beta,gamma-methylene adenosine triphosphate and alpha,beta-methylene adenosine
      diphosphate are ineffective. The conversion occurs only partially in the absence 
      of estradiol but completely in its presence. The process is not inhibited by the 
      protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and alpha 2-macroglobulin, and 
      when conversion is induced by low concentrations of ATP (1 mM), a time dependent 
      reequilibration back to Rx occurs. These observations and the fact that the pure 
      hormone-binding peptides Rx and Ry have similar molecular weights on sodium
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (66,000) confirm that proteolysis is not
      involved in the conversion. Moreover their physical properties suggest that Rx
      and Ry exist in alternate conformations, with Ry being favored as a result of an 
      ATP-mediated event involving the gamma-phosphoryl moiety. The biological
      relevance of the receptor conversion is suggested by studies with the
      antiestrogen hydroxytamoxifen. This antiestrogen binds to Rx with higher affinity
      than either estradiol or diethylstilbestrol but with low affinity to Ry.
      Hydroxytamoxifen also inhibits the conversion of Rx to Ry. Since this
      antiestrogen is a complete antagonist in the chick oviduct and prevents
      estradiol-induced stimulation of ovalbumin gene transcription, it is speculated
      that Rx to Ry conversion is crucial for ovalbumin gene activation and that Rx may
      act as a transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, since Rx and Ry both bind to
      nuclei and DNA, it is proposed that the presence of Ry is a better predictor of
      ovalbumin gene activation than DNA binding alone.

TI  - Binding of oxytocin to uterine cells in vitro. Occurrence of several binding site
      populations and reidentification of oxytocin receptors.
PG  - 16984-9
AB  - Myometrial and endometrial cells of sheep, rat, and calf in monolayer cell
      culture display at least three populations of binding sites for oxytocin, with
      dissociation constants (Kd) of approximately 5 X 10(-9), 4 X 10(-7), and greater 
      than 10(-5) mol/liter, respectively. Binding of the tritium-labeled oxytocin
      (concentration range, 10(-11) to 5 X 10(-4) M) to the first two sites is
      displaceable by cold oxytocin. The ratio of binding capacities of the high to
      medium affinity site appears to average 1:18. Dissociation rate constants for
      these sites (22 degrees C) are roughly 10(-4) and 2 X 10(-3) s-1, respectively.
      The capacity of the low affinity site varies in individual cell preparations and 
      is between 5 and 66 times that of the medium affinity site. The low affinity
      binding sites may not be fully saturable and may follow a nonasymptotic binding
      isotherm. Logarithms of Kd and binding capacity for individual binding sites are 
      linearly correlated. The coexistence of the three sites was also proven by
      cluster analysis based on similarities between Kd, binding capacity, and Hill
      coefficient. Only minor systematic species and cell type differences occur in
      these properties. The value of Kd for the oxytocin receptor in rat myometrium,
      derived recently from a stepwise irreversible inhibition of uterotonic response
      to oxytocin, is close to 2.5 X 10(-7) mol/liter. Additional pharmacological data 
      (pA2 values of structural analogues of oxytocin acting as competitive inhibitors)
      also reveal a Kd value of 3 X 10(-7). It is, therefore, concluded that the
      receptors for oxytocin in rat myometrium are identical with the medium affinity
      site.

TI  - Calcium ion as a probe of the monovalent cation center of sodium, potassium
      ATPase.
PG  - 16957-62
AB  - Sodium and potassium ion-transport adenosine triphosphatase from dog kidney was
      incubated with 0.4-2 mM Ca2+ at 23 degrees C for more than 2 min in the absence
      of monovalent inorganic cations, cooled to 0 degrees C, and phosphorylated from 1
      mM Pi with 2.4 mM MgCl2. The resultant phosphoenzyme resembled that obtained by
      incubating the enzyme with K+ in place of Ca2+ in six respects. It was concluded 
      that Ca2+ can occupy the monovalent cation-binding center for K+. The rate
      constant for release of Ca2+ from the dephosphoenzyme at 0 degrees C was 0.17
      s-1. The rate of release from the phosphoenzyme was at least 7-fold slower.
      Phosphorylation stabilized the binding of Ca2+ to the enzyme in contrast to its
      destabilization of the corresponding K X enzyme complex. K-sensitive
      phosphoenzyme did not respond to free Ca2+. Thus Ca2+ was not easily accepted by 
      nor released from the phosphoenzyme and would not be an effective substrate for
      transport. A selective barrier against Ca2+ between the monovalent cation binding
      center and the extracellular solution is proposed. Release of calcium from the
      dephosphoenzyme yielded a conformation that was not phosphorylated from Pi. The
      enzyme changed the conformation of its center for phosphorylation before or at
      the same time that it changed the conformation of its center for ion transport.

TI  - Oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dibenzo[p]-dioxins by
      Phanerochaete chrysosporium ligninase.
PG  - 16948-52
AB  - The lignin peroxidase (ligninase) of Phanerochaete chrysosporium catalyzes the
      oxidation of a variety of lignin-related compounds. Here we report that this
      enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of certain aromatic pollutants and compounds 
      related to them, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with ionization
      potentials less than or equal to approximately 7.55 eV. This result demonstrates 
      that the H2O2-oxidized states of lignin peroxidase are more oxidizing than the
      analogous states of classical peroxidases. Experiments with pyrene as the
      substrate showed that pyrene-1,6-dione and pyrene-1,8-dione are the major
      oxidation products (84% of total as determined by high performance liquid
      chromatography), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of
      ligninase-catalyzed pyrene oxidations done in the presence of H2(18)O showed that
      the quinone oxygens come from water. We found that whole cultures of P.
      chrysosporium also transiently oxidize pyrene to these quinones. Experiments with
      dibenzo[p]dioxin and 2-chlorodibenzo[p]dioxin showed that they are also
      substrates for ligninase. The immediate product of dibenzo[p]dioxin oxidation is 
      the dibenzo[p]dioxin cation radical, which was observed in enzymatic reactions by
      its electron spin resonance and visible absorption spectra. The cation radical
      mechanism of ligninase thus applies not only to lignin, but also to other
      environmentally significant aromatics.

TI  - Regulation of calbindin-D28K gene expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is
      correlated to receptor occupancy.
PG  - 16943-7
AB  - 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) induces the synthesis of calcium binding 
      protein (calbindin-D28K) and calbindin-D28K-mRNA in the chick intestine. We have 
      examined the relationship between nuclear uptake of 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-(OH)2D3
      receptor occupancy levels, and transcription of the calbindin-D28K gene and found
      all three parameters to be highly correlated. All three events occur rapidly
      (within 15-30 min) following a single dose of 6.5 nmol of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to vitamin
      D-deficient chicks, reaching peak values by 1-2 h; by 4 h, values of all three
      parameters start to decline. Calbindin-D28K-mRNA begins to accumulate by 3-5 h
      but does not peak until 12 h following hormone administration. The levels of
      calbindin-D28K start to increase by 5-8 h and do not peak until 48 h after the
      1,25-(OH)2D3 dose. These observations suggest that post-transcriptional
      regulatory mechanisms may be involved. Measurements of basal levels of
      calbindin-D28K gene transcription show that there is virtually no transcription
      in the vitamin D-deficient chick intestine, and a 12-fold induction in the
      intestine of vitamin D-replete chicks. This basal level of transcription in
      vitamin D-replete chick intestine is not inhibited by cycloheximide pretreatment.
      These results confirm the thesis that a major component of the mechanism of
      action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 is functioning as a steroid hormone, effected through the 
      direct action of the seco-steroid-receptor complex on the initiation of
      transcription of specific genes.

      and vitamin D3 in rat liver microsomes.
PG  - 16932-6
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies directed against the cytochrome P-450 catalyzing
      25-hydroxylation of C27-steroids and vitamin D3 (Andersson, S., Holmberg, I., and
      Wikvall, K. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6777-6781) have been prepared by
      immunization of mice in hind footpads. Lymph node cells from the mice were fused 
      with the Sp 2/0-Ag 14 line of mouse myeloma cells. A monoclonal antibody,
      designated MAb-25-6, monospecific for cytochrome P-450(25) was, after coupling to
      Sepharose, able to bind to cytochrome P-450(25) and to immunoprecipitate the
      activity for 25-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol
      and vitamin D3 as well as that for 16 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone when
      assayed in a reconstituted system. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of adult
      male rat liver microsomes and immunoblotting with MAb-25-6 showed a single spot
      with an apparent isoelectric point of 7.4 and Mr approximately 51,000. By sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with
      MAb-25-6, cytochrome P-450(25) was shown to be male-specific and not detectable
      in adult female rat liver microsomes. N-terminal sequence analysis of cytochrome 
      P-450(25) showed a structure identical with that of the male-specific steroid 16 
      alpha-hydroxylase isolated in several laboratories.

TI  - Effects of lithium ions on glycogen synthase and phosphorylase in rat
      hepatocytes.
PG  - 16927-31
AB  - Incubation of hepatocytes from fasted rats with LiCl provoked a concentration-
      and time-dependent activation of glycogen synthase. This effect was observed in
      the absence of glucose in the incubation medium. No changes in the intracellular 
      concentrations of ATP or glucose-6-phosphate were detected. Lithium was also able
      to activate glycogen synthase in the absence of extracellular calcium. If
      hepatocytes were incubated with lithium and insulin, an additive effect of both
      agents on glycogen synthase activity was observed. LiCl was also effective in
      activating the enzyme in hepatocytes obtained from fed rats. When hepatocytes
      were incubated with [33P]phosphate and then treated with LiCl, a decrease in the 
      amount of [32P]phosphate incorporated in the enzyme was observed. This
      dephosphorylation affected two CNBr fragments of the enzyme (CB-2 and CB-1),
      suggesting that several phosphorylation sites were involved. Lithium was also
      able to activate glycogen phosphorylase from both fasted and fed rats.
      Phosphorylase activation was concentration- and time-dependent, either in the
      presence or absence of calcium in the incubation medium. These findings
      demonstrate that although lithium appears to mimic the effects of insulin on
      glycogen synthase activity, its mechanism of action must be different from that
      of the hormone.

TI  - The mitogenic signaling pathway of fibroblast growth factor is not mediated
      through polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and protein kinase C activation in
      hamster fibroblasts.
PG  - 16916-22
AB  - Basic or acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), alone, was found to be as potent 
      as alpha-thrombin to reinitiate DNA synthesis in G0-arrested Chinese hamster lung
      fibroblasts (CCL39). Basic FGF at 50 ng/ml or thrombin at 1 unit/ml rapidly
      initiated early events such as cytoplasmic alkalinization (0.2-0.3 pH units),
      rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+, phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and increased
      c-myc expression, followed by a 30-40-fold increase in labeled nuclei. Whereas
      thrombin is a potent activator of phospholipase C as judged by the rapid release 
      of inositol trisphosphate, inositol bisphosphate and by the massive accumulation 
      of total inositol phosphate (IP) in the presence of 20 mM Li+, FGF failed to
      induce the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides in quiescent CCL39 cells. Indeed,
      no inositol trisphosphate nor inositol bisphosphate could be detected in response
      to FGF; in presence of Li+ the total IP release never exceeded 8% of the IP
      released by the action of thrombin. Two additional findings indicated that FGF
      and thrombin activate different signaling pathways. First, we found that, in
      contrast to thrombin, the FGF-induced rise in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+
      concentration measured by quin-2 fluorescence, is strictly dependent upon the
      presence of Ca2+ in the external medium. Second, we found that FGF failed to
      activate protein kinase C as judged by the epidermal growth factor-receptor
      binding assay. Treatment of the cells with either thrombin or phorbol esters,
      rapidly inhibited 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor binding (50-60%). Basic or
      acidic FGF had no effect. We conclude that: the FGF-receptor signaling pathway is
      not coupled to phospholipase C activation, and early mitogenic events and
      reinitiation of DNA synthesis can be initiated independently of inositol lipid
      breakdown and protein kinase C activation.

TI  - Possible involvement of cyclic AMP and calcium ion in prostaglandin E1-induced
      elevation of c-myc mRNA levels in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts.
PG  - 16878-82
AB  - Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) caused a rapid and dose-dependent increase in cAMP
      levels, followed by elevation of c-myc mRNA levels and then increased DNA
      synthesis in quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. The dose-response
      curves of PGE1 were nearly the same for each of these three processes. Both
      8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin increased c-myc mRNA levels to 40-50% and DNA
      synthesis to 70-80% of those caused by a maximally effective dose of PGE1. Under 
      the comparable conditions, PGE1 did not stimulate diacylglycerol formation or
      activate protein kinase C. However, PGE1 did elevate cytoplasmic free Ca2+
      concentration as measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin 2.
      8-Bromo-cAMP and forskolin were inactive in this capacity. The Ca2+ ionophore
      A23187 increased the level of c-myc mRNA. Diacylglycerol and Ca2+ mediate the
      elevation of c-myc mRNA levels which is caused by platelet-derived growth factor 
      and fibroblast growth factor (Kaibuchi, K., Tsuda, T., Kikuchi, A., Tanimoto, T.,
      Yamashita, T., and Takai, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1187-1192). In contrast, 
      the present results suggest that both cAMP and Ca2+ are involved in this
      PGE1-induced response in Swiss 3T3 cells.

PG  - 16848-53
AB  - The effect of the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on
      expression of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene was studied in rat hepatoma
      H4IIE cells. Like insulin, PMA provokes a concentration and time-dependent
      decrease of mRNA coding for that enzyme that is due to an inhibition of
      P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription. This effect of PMA is rapid,
      reversible, specific for phorbol esters known to be active in other systems, and 
      it does not require on-going protein synthesis. PMA overrides the stimulatory
      effects cAMP and glucocorticoid analogs have on the transcription of this gene. A
      synthetic diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, also inhibits P-enolpyruvate
      carboxykinase gene transcription. These effects of PMA and synthetic
      diacylglycerol are specific, since neither affected total mRNA synthesis. We
      conclude that diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, specific stimulators of protein 
      kinase C, inhibit the transcription of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene in H4IIE
      cells. The findings support the hypothesis that diacylglycerols generated in the 
      plasma membrane can act as an intracellular signal that regulates specific gene
      expression.

TI  - Regulation of the phosphoinositide hydrolysis pathway in thrombin-stimulated
      platelets by a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein.
      Evaluation of its contribution to platelet activation and comparisons with the
      adenylate cyclase inhibitory protein, Gi.
PG  - 16838-47
AB  - In platelets activated by thrombin, the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
      4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C produces inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)
      and diacylglycerol, metabolites which are known to cause Ca2+ release from the
      platelet dense tubular system and granule secretion. Previous studies suggest
      that phospholipase C activation is coupled to platelet thrombin receptors by a
      guanine nucleotide-binding protein or G protein. The present studies examine the 
      contribution of this protein to thrombin-induced platelet activation and compare 
      its properties with those of Gi, the G protein which mediates inhibition of
      adenylate cyclase by thrombin. In platelets permeabilized with saponin,
      nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs reproduced the effects of thrombin by causing
      diacylglycerol formation, Ca2+ release from the dense tubular system and
      serotonin secretion. In intact platelets, fluoride, which by-passes the thrombin 
      receptor and directly activates G proteins, caused phosphoinositide hydrolysis
      and secretion. Fluoride also caused an increase in the platelet cytosolic free
      Ca2+ concentration that appeared to be due to a combination of Ca2+ release from 
      the dense tubular system and increased Ca2+ influx across the platelet plasma
      membrane. Guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), which inhibits G
      protein function, inhibited the ability of thrombin to cause IP3 and
      diacylglycerol formation, granule secretion, and Ca2+ release from the dense
      tubular system in saponin-treated platelets. Increasing the thrombin
      concentration overcame the effects of GDP beta S on secretion without restoring
      diacylglycerol formation. The effects of GDP beta S on platelet responses to
      thrombin which had been subjected to partial proteolysis (gamma-thrombin) were
      similar to those obtained with native alpha-thrombin despite the fact that
      gamma-thrombin is a less potent inhibitor of adenylate cyclase than is
      alpha-thrombin. Thrombin-induced diacylglycerol formation and 45Ca release were
      also inhibited when the saponin-treated platelets were preincubated with
      pertussis toxin, an event that was associated with the ADP-ribosylation of a
      protein with Mr = 41.7 kDa. At each concentration tested, the inhibition of
      thrombin-induced diacylglycerol formation by pertussis toxin paralleled the
      inhibition of thrombin's ability to suppress PGI2-stimulated cAMP
      formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Targeted inhibition of transferrin-mediated iron uptake in Hep G2 hepatoma cells.
PG  - 16834-7
AB  - We have used a model system consisting of two human hepatoma cell lines, Hep G2, 
      representing well differentiated normal hepatocytes, and PLC/PRF/5, representing 
      poorly differentiated malignant hepatocytes, to demonstrate that the differential
      presence of asialoglycoprotein receptor activity in these cell lines can be used 
      to influence transferrin-mediated iron uptake. We based our experiments on the
      following facts: Hep G2 cells possess receptors that bind, internalize, and
      degrade galactose-terminal (asialo-)glycoproteins; PLC/PRF/5 cells have barely
      detectable asialoglycoprotein receptor activity; both cell lines possess active
      transferrin-mediated iron uptake; transferrin releases iron during acidification 
      of intracellular vesicular compartments; primary amines, e.g. primaquine, inhibit
      acidification and iron release from transferrin. When added to culture medium,
      [55Fe]transferrin delivered 55Fe well to both cell lines. As expected, in the
      presence of [55Fe]transferrin, free primaquine caused a concentration-dependent
      decrease in 55Fe uptake in both cell lines. To create a targetable conjugate,
      primaquine was covalently coupled to asialofetuin to form
      asialofetuin-primaquine. When PLC/PRF/5 (asialoglycoprotein receptor (-)) cells
      were preincubated with this conjugate, transferrin-mediated 55Fe uptake was
      unaffected. However, transferrin-mediated 55Fe uptake by Hep G2
      (asialoglycoprotein receptor (+)) cells under identical conditions was
      specifically decreased by 55% compared to control cells incubated without the
      conjugate.

PG  - 16811-7
AB  - The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of Dictyostelium discoideum functions to 
      maintain the responsiveness of cells to the chemoattractant cAMP during the
      aggregation phase of development. We have prepared a cDNA library and have
      isolated clones which contain a portion of the 5' untranslated region and the
      entire coding and 3' untranslated portions of the cyclic nucleotide
      phosphodiesterase gene. The primary structure of the extracellular cyclic
      nucleotide phosphodiesterase precursor has been deduced from the nucleotide
      sequence. The molecule is composed of 452 amino acids and was calculated to have 
      a molecular mass of 51,078 daltons. Forty-nine amino-terminal residues which
      contain a hydrophobic leader sequence are not present in the mature extracellular
      enzyme. Four potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were found within
      the phosphodiesterase. An amino acid sequence homology search revealed no closely
      related proteins. Phosphodiesterase mRNA levels are low in growing cells and
      first increase soon after the onset of development. The amount of transcript then
      decreases before rising in abundance to maximum levels during the terminal stages
      of cell aggregation and apical tip formation. During formation of the fruiting
      body, levels of phosphodiesterase mRNA decrease. Exposure of cells to cAMP
      increases the amount of phosphodiesterase mRNA. Increases of mRNA abundance are
      correlated with increases in enzyme activity, suggesting regulation at the level 
      of transcription.

TI  - Molecular cloning of the rat stomach (H+ + K+)-ATPase.
PG  - 16788-91
AB  - We have isolated cDNA clones for the rat stomach (H+ + K+)-ATPase by employing a 
      novel procedure involving the use of oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved 
      amino acid sequences of related cation transport ATPase and a cross-hybridization
      with the sheep kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase alpha-subunit cDNA. The complete
      nucleotide sequence of the cDNA has been determined and the amino acid sequence
      of the protein deduced. The ATPase consists of 1,033 amino acids and has an Mr of
      114,012. Amino acid homology and hydropathy plot comparisons between the gastric 
      ATPase and the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase catalytic subunit demonstrate a striking
      similarity which suggests that their higher order structure and mechanism of
      action are virtually identical. The greatest homology occurs in the
      phosphorylation site region and in domains which may be involved in nucleotide
      binding and energy transduction. The most substantial differences occur in the
      N-terminal region and in the transmembrane domains. In addition, we report the
      presence of an open reading frame 5' to the translation initiation site of the
      gastric ATPase, which raises the possibility that the mRNA is polycistronic.

TI  - Cross-linking of a growth hormone releasing factor-binding protein in anterior
      pituitary cells.
PG  - 16781-4
AB  - Growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates the release of growth hormone
      from the anterior pituitary and is related to the peptides of the
      glucagon/secretin family. Although the mechanism of action of this hormone has
      been studied in considerable detail, little is known concerning the GRF receptor 
      itself. We have attempted to label the GRF receptor by chemically coupling the
      125I-GRF analog [His1, Nle27]-hGRF(1-32)-NH2 (GRFa) (where Nle is norleucine) to 
      plated rat anterior pituitary cells with the protein cross-linker disuccinimidyl 
      suberate (DSS) (0.1 mM). Verification of biological activity of the 125I-GRFa was
      confirmed prior to the cross-linking experiments using the reverse hemolytic
      plaque assay. Whole cell extracts prepared from the cross-linked cells were
      subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed
      by autoradiography of the dried gels. Four bands of 72, 50, 30, and 26 kDa were
      detected in autoradiograms from cells exposed to the labeled analog for 20 min
      (22 degrees C) followed by exposure to DSS for 2 min. The 72-kDa band was
      interpreted to be bovine serum albumin, which was used as a carrier in initial
      studies. The 50- and 30-kDa bands were very faint and probably represent
      nonspecific binding sites since they were unchanged in the presence of excess
      unlabeled GRFa. The 26-kDa band was diminished in a concentration-dependent
      manner by unlabeled rat GRF, GRFa, and to a lesser extent by vasoactive
      intestinal peptide (VIP). It is unlikely, however, that GRFa was acting at a VIP 
      receptor since the labeled analog did not induce prolactin secretion (VIP is a
      prolactin secretagogue). GRFa also increased cellular cAMP to levels similar to
      GRF and greater than VIP. Autoradiographs from gels run under nonreducing
      conditions revealed the 26-kDa band as the major species, indicating that, if a
      polymeric form of this binding protein exists, it does not involve disulfide
      linkages. Thus, the best candidate for the putative GRF receptor is the 26-kDa
      band. We have further demonstrated that the higher concentrations of DSS used
      previously (5 mM) result in diffuse autoradiograms with multiple bands,
      suggesting that caution should be exercised when interpreting cross-linking data 
      under these conditions.

TI  - Alteration of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozyme pools during heart development and
      aging.
PG  - 17170-3
AB  - The nature of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozyme pools in fetal, neonatal, young
      adult (3 months), and aged (30 months) rat hearts was studied using
      chromatographic and immunological techniques. Furthermore, the changing subunit
      composition of each isozyme pool was determined by sodium dodecyl
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6% slab gels and by immunoblotting 
      with subunit-specific antibodies. Although all three subunit types were expressed
      in heart throughout life, total activity and the nature of the isozyme pools
      varied during neonatal development and in aged heart. In fetal heart, the complex
      tetramers containing all three subunits appeared to be the major isozyme types.
      As the heart matured to the young adult stage, the M-type subunit increased over 
      6-fold; whereas the changes in the other two subunits were considerably less.
      These data indicate that during neonatal heart maturation the isozymic pools
      progressively exhibited increased amounts of the tetrameric forms containing two 
      or more M-type subunits. In aged heart relative to the young adult (3 months)
      heart, the total activity and proportion of M-type subunit in the isozymes were
      decreased; and consequently, the amounts of the M-rich isozymes were decreased.
      The shifts in the types of isozymes during heart maturation and subsequent aging 
      were primarily due to changes in availability of the M-type subunit to
      participate in random assembly of the tetrameric isozymes.

TI  - ATPase activities and actin-binding properties of subfragments of Acanthamoeba
      myosin IA.
PG  - 17156-62
AB  - Previous studies had led to the conclusion that the globular, single-headed
      myosins IA and IB from Acanthamoeba castellanii contain two actin-binding sites: 
      one associated with the catalytic site and whose binding to F-actin activates the
      Mg2+-ATPase activity and a second site whose binding results in the cross-linking
      of actin filaments and makes the actin-activated ATPase activity positively
      cooperative with respect to myosin I concentration. We have now prepared a
      100,000-Da NH2-terminal peptide and a 30,000-Da COOH-terminal peptide by
      alpha-chymotryptic digestion of the myosin IA heavy chain. The intact 17,000-Da
      light chain remained associated with the 100,000-Da fragment, which also
      contained the serine residue that must be phosphorylated for expression of
      actin-activated ATPase activity by native myosin IA. The 30,000-Da peptide, which
      contained 34% glycine and 21% proline, bound to F-actin with a KD less than 0.5
      microM in the presence or absence of ATP but had no ATPase activity. The
      100,000-Da peptide bound to F-actin with KD = 0.4-0.8 microM in the presence of 2
      mM MgATP and KD less than 0.01 microM in the absence of MgATP. In contrast to
      native myosin IA, neither peptide cross-linked actin filaments. The
      phosphorylated 100,000-Da peptide had actin-activated ATPase activity with the
      same Vmax as that of native phosphorylated myosin IA but this activity displayed 
      simple, noncooperative hyperbolic dependence on the actin concentration in
      contrast to the complex cooperative kinetics observed with native myosin IA.
      These results provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of two
      actin-binding sites on myosin IA, as was suggested by enzyme kinetic and filament
      cross-linking data, and also for the previously proposed mechanism by which
      monomeric myosins I could support contractile activities.

TI  - Solubilization of the vasopressin receptor from rat liver plasma membranes.
      Evidence for a receptor X GTP-binding protein complex.
PG  - 16871-7
AB  - The GTPase activity of plasma membranes isolated from rat livers was stimulated
      20% over basal by vasopressin. A concentration dependency curve showed that
      maximal stimulation was obtained with 10(-8) M vasopressin. The
      vasopressin-stimulated GTPase activity was not inhibited in plasma membranes that
      had been ADP-ribosylated with either cholera toxin or pertussis toxin. Identical 
      results were obtained from plasma membranes that had been solubilized with 1%
      digitonin. When membranes that had been solubilized after preincubation with
      [3H]vasopressin were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, the majority
      of protein-bound [3H]vasopressin migrated as a single band with a sedimentation
      constant of 16.8 S. Moreover, there was a GTPase activity that migrated with the 
      bound [3H]vasopressin. This peak of bound [3H]vasopressin was decreased by 90%
      when the sucrose gradient centrifugation was run in the presence of 10 microM
      guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). When the 16.8 S peak of bound [3H]vasopressin 
      was further purified over a wheat germ lectin-Sepharose column, a GTPase activity
      co-eluted from the column with the protein-bound [3H]vasopressin. Direct evidence
      that a GTP-binding protein was present in the 16.8 S peak was obtained by the
      immunodetection of a 35-kDa beta subunit of a GTP-binding protein. These results 
      support the conclusion that liver plasma membranes contain a GTP-binding protein 
      that can complex with the vasopressin receptor.

TI  - Interaction of the D-isomer of gamma-methylene glutamate with an active site
      thiol of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase.
PG  - 17134-7
AB  - gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase has a thiol group in the vicinity of its
      glutamate-binding site. During efforts to find a covalently bound inhibitor,
      interaction of the enzyme with gamma-methylene glutamate was examined because
      this analog of glutamate, which has an alpha,beta-unsaturated moiety, would be
      expected to bind at the glutamate site and might react with an active site thiol.
      gamma-Methylene glutamate, which is not a significant substrate, inhibits the
      enzyme competitively toward glutamate. Preincubation of the enzyme with
      gamma-methylene DL-glutamate led to substantial inactivation which was dependent 
      upon the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+; glutamate protected against inactivation.
      Inactivation was observed with the D-isomer of gamma-methylene glutamate, but not
      with the corresponding L-isomer. The inactivated enzyme contains close to 1 mol
      of gamma-methylene glutamate/mol of enzyme. Studies in which enzyme inactivated
      by treatment with [14C]gamma-methylene glutamate was hydrolyzed indicate that
      gamma-methylene glutamate reacts with an active site thiol.

TI  - Extended X-ray absorption fine structure of Mn2+ and Mn2+ X ATP complex bound to 
      coupling factor 1 of the H+-ATPase from chloroplasts.
PG  - 16969-75
AB  - The spinach chloroplast ATPase, coupling factor 1, contains three tight
      Mn2+-binding sites which interact cooperatively. The bound manganese
      coordinations were studied by x-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Mn2+ was 
      found to be bound to the enzyme with an average Mn-O bond length of 2.15 +/- 0.15
      A, significantly shorter than the 2.15 +/- 0.15 A of the Mn-O bond of the average
      first hydration shell for Mn2+ in aqueous solution. On adding ATP to the
      manganese-enzyme mixture, a tertiary complex of Mn2+ X ATP X enzyme was formed as
      indicated by the appearance of a second shell. Mn-P bond distances were estimated
      at 4.95 +/- 0.15 A in the tertiary Mn2+ X ATP X enzyme complex, which was
      considerably longer than the Mn-P bond distance of 3.36 +/- 0.15 A for the Mn2+ X
      ATP complex in aqueous solution. The Mn-P bond distance in the tertiary Mn2+ X
      ATP X enzyme complex decreased to 4.32 +/- 0.15 A when selenite, a potent
      effector of ATPase activity, was added. Based on these results, it is suggested
      that the tertiary complex is required for catalysis. The stimulation of ATP
      hydrolysis by anions such as selenite may be the result of shortening the
      distance between Mn2+ and the ATP phosphates in the enzyme active site.

TI  - Timing of symptoms and oocyst excretion in human cryptosporidiosis.
PG  - 1643-7
AB  - To determine the timing of symptoms and oocyst excretion after the acquisition of
      cryptosporidium infection, we used a screening parasitologic stool examination to
      identify patients and then contacted them for the collection of retrospective
      histories and follow-up stool specimens. The study included 68 otherwise healthy 
      patients with an identifiable source and time of infection. All 68 had diarrhea, 
      61 had abdominal pain, most also had other gastrointestinal symptoms, 33 had
      fever, and all recovered spontaneously. Among the 50 patients who submitted
      follow-up stool samples, more than 90 percent of the 610 symptomatic days and of 
      the 136 oocyst-positive stools occurred between days 7 and 28 of infection, the
      mean incubation period was 7.2 days (range, 1 to 12), and the mean duration of
      illness was 12.2 days (range, 2 to 26). During the oocyst-excretion period
      cryptosporidium was detected in 90 percent of Ziehl-Neelsen-stained fecal
      concentrates. The end of oocyst excretion could be accurately determined in 26
      patients; 19 (73 percent) had positive stools after the cessation of symptoms for
      a mean period of 6.9 days (range, 1 to 15). Fourteen patients were studied for
      two or more months, and in three of them asymptomatic episodes of oocyst
      excretion were detected up to two months after clinical recovery. We conclude
      that many cases of symptomatic cryptosporidiosis occur among immunocompetent
      patients, some of whom may excrete oocysts even when they have become
      asymptomatic. Conversely, infected symptomatic patients may occasionally have
      intermittently negative stools.

PG  - 17033-9
AB  - The protein(s) that constitute(s) the cGMP-regulated channel in vertebrate
      photoreceptors has been solubilized from rod outer segment membranes and
      reincorporated into the membrane of calcium-containing liposomes. The properties 
      of the reconstituted channel protein were determined by studying the
      cGMP-stimulated efflux of Ca2+ from these liposomes. Among several detergents
      tested the zwitterionic detergent
      3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) proved to be
      the most suitable. Solubilization of channel activity was found to be optimal at 
      a detergent concentration of about 18 mM. The presence of Ca2+ ions and
      phospholipids during solubilization greatly increased the channel stability. The 
      reconstituted channel shared most but not all properties with the channel in
      situ. It is cooperatively activated by cGMP with an EC50 of 19 microM. The
      cooperativity as determined from Hill plots was n = 2.7. Unlike the
      cGMP-sensitive channel in the native membrane of isolated discs and excised
      patches of plasma membrane it is not blocked by l-cis-diltiazem. Reconstitution
      of this channel protein(s) may serve as a valuable tool for identifying the
      polypeptide composition and to study structural and functional aspects of the
      purified protein(s).

PG  - 16854-9
AB  - The effects of the condensation product of N-methyl-p-methoxyphenethylamine with 
      formaldehyde (compound 48/80) and ruthenium red on the partial reactions of the
      catalytic cycle of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle were
      studied. The ATPase activity and both Ca2+ and Sr2+ uptake were inhibited by
      compound 48/80 when oxalate was used as a precipitating agent. The degree of
      inhibition decreased when oxalate was replaced by orthophosphate as the
      precipitating anion. Both the fast Ca2+ efflux and the synthesis of ATP observed 
      during reversal of the Ca2+ pump were inhibited by compound 48/80. Inhibition of 
      the reversal of the Ca2+ pump was caused by a competition between compound 48/80 
      and orthophosphate for the phosphorylation site of the enzyme. The fast Ca2+
      release promoted by arsenate was impaired by compound 48/80. Ruthenium red
      competes with Ca2+ for the high affinity binding site of the Ca2+-ATPase, but did
      not interfere with the binding of Ca2+ to the low affinity binding site of the
      enzyme. In presence of Ca2+ concentrations higher than 5 microM, ruthenium red in
      concentrations up to 200 microM had no effect on both ATPase activity and Ca2+
      uptake. However, the fast Ca2+ efflux promoted by arsenate and the fast Ca2+
      efflux coupled with the synthesis of ATP observed during the reversal of the Ca2+
      pump were inhibited by ruthenium red, half-maximal inhibition being attained in
      presence of 10-20 microM ruthenium red. In contrast to the effect of compound
      48/80, ruthenium red did not inhibit the phosphorylation of the enzyme by
      orthophosphate. The ATP in equilibrium with Pi exchange catalyzed by the
      Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of transmembrane Ca2+ gradient was also inhibited by
      ruthenium red.

AB  - A simpler, less expensive, and faster high-performance liquid chromatographic
      method was shown to be an alternative to urokinase potency determinations by the 
      Ploug method. Post-elution recovery of the low-molecular-weight form was 104 +/- 
      2.4% as determined by the Ploug method. Two analysts reported relative standard
      deviations of 1.6% and 1.1% based on peak height determination of eight replicate
      injections of a single sample of low-molecular-weight material. Linearity at the 
      same wavelength for low- and high-molecular-weight forms was 0.9999 and 0.9992,
      respectively, for peak height versus potency.

TI  - Thin-layer electrophoretic behaviour of oligo- and mono-saccharides, uronic acids
      and polyhydroxy compounds obtained as biomass degradation products.
PG  - 485-93
AB  - A recently developed thin-layer electrophoretic method has been applied to the
      determination of biomass degradation products comprising mono-, oligo- and
      polysaccharides and their derivatives as well as phenolic compounds. The
      separation was carried out using 0.3 M aqueous borate solution as the buffer and 
      silanized silica gel as the support, the surface of the latter being covered with
      a thin film of octanol-1. For visualization of the carbohydrates, specific
      sulphuric acid-containing naphthoresorcinol and orcinol reagents were applied.
      The mobility of hydrolyzed products is determined by the number and position of
      their reactive sites and, to a less extent, by the size of their molecule. The
      good separations obtained confirm this method as an alternative to the commonly
      utilized chromatographic procedures.

TI  - Metallic copper-containing post-column reactor for the detection of thiram and
      disulfiram in liquid chromatography.
PG  - 439-47
AB  - A reaction detector has been developed for the selective detection of thiram and 
      disulfiram. The detection is based on the post-column complexation of these
      analytes on a solid-state reactor packed with finely divided metallic copper to
      form a coloured copper complex, copper(II) N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamate, with an
      absorption maximum at 435 nm. The method is combined with a pre-concentration and
      clean-up step on a pre-column to permit the sub-ppb determination of, e.g.,
      thiram in surface water samples or disulfiram in urine. Separation is achieved by
      reversed-phase liquid chromatography.

TI  - General reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the
      separation of drugs using triethylamine as a competing base.
PG  - 403-18
AB  - Triethylamine (TEA) was evaluated as a competing base for the retention control
      and peak shape improvement in the reversed-phase high-performance liquid
      chromatographic (RP-HPLC) analysis of selected acidic, basic, and neutral drugs. 
      The effects of this amine on the capacity factor and theoretical plate number
      values of ephedrine, phenol, and sulfamerazine were examined on three unmodified 
      commercial octadecylsilane chromatographic columns. Based on these results, a
      general RP-HPLC elution scheme using a mu Bondapak C18 10-micron column,
      methanol-acetic acid-TEA-water mobile phases, and an ultraviolet detector was
      developed for more than 150 drugs of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed method
      was applied to the separation of groups of chemically or pharmacologically
      related drugs that included sympathomimetic amines, antihistamines,
      phenothiazines, local anesthetics, Cinchona and tropane alkaloids, xanthines,
      sulfonamides, and steroids. In addition, paired-ion drugs such as physostigmine
      salicylate and combinations of ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid,
      pamoic acid, and 8-chlorotheophylline with various basic moieties were readily
      and effectively resolved into their ionic components using almost identical
      RP-HPLC conditions.

TI  - Assessment of coating-efficiency in ELISA plates by direct protein determination.
PG  - 291-3
AB  - A commercially available protein determination method (Pierce BCA protein
      determination kit) was used to assess the efficiency of coating of microtiter
      plates. Since the method is insensitive to detergents it permits the
      determination of adhered protein after washing the microtiter plate with a
      detergent-containing solution. Thus only tightly bound protein is determined. Our
      results suggest that coating of microtiter plates with antibody is optimal at a
      certain concentration, above which coating is less efficient.

PG  - 283-8
AB  - To facilitate the use of Western blots for the detection of antibodies, we have
      developed an incubation apparatus. The use of this apparatus simplifies the
      incubation of blots with antisera, permits the testing of large numbers of sera
      and eliminates artefacts caused by the use of loose strips. The introduction of a
      pressure bag in the lower lid of the apparatus secures a steady pressure over the
      entire blot, a feature lacking in currently available commercial equipment. The
      detection of antinuclear antibodies is presented as an example of the use of this
      incubator.

      cold insoluble globulin (fibronectin). Since fibronectin binds to gelatin-coated 
      surface, we developed a simple technique for separation of human peripheral blood
      monocytes from whole mononuclear cell preparation. These preparations are
      characterized by a high monocyte purity (more than 90%), low platelet
      contamination and excellent viability.

AB  - A means of identifying the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) phenotype of
      chickens has been developed using solubilised extracts of cell membranes. The
      proteins from the solubilised membranes are separated by gel electrophoresis,
      applied to nitrocellulose membranes and detected using specific alloantisera
      followed by biotin-conjugated secondary antisera and avidin-glucose oxidase
      complex. This procedure allows samples to be stored frozen for at least 2 years
      before analysis and in conjunction with Western blotting allows characterisation 
      of the class of MHC-encoded protein identified by the antisera.

PG  - 259-66
AB  - Two types of polymeric microparticle, Dynospheres and reprecipitated
      acid-hydrolysed nylon 6/6, and two methods of activating these particles with
      either tresyl chloride or carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) prior to covalent linkage of 
      antibodies were investigated with a view towards their respective adoption for
      the preparation of general solid-phase reagents for immunoassay applications.
      Activation of each particle and coupling of antibodies was rapid irrespective of 
      the activator. CDI proved to be the activator of choice since it was cheap, less 
      hazardous, more efficient and less pH dependent than tresyl chloride. Both types 
      of microparticle remain buoyant during the RIA incubation periods and form stable
      pellets after centrifugation. In second antibody applications immobilisation of
      the first antibody occurs with a short incubation period of 30 min. Nylon
      microparticles have a higher antibody-coupling capacity and are the particles of 
      choice in both first and second antibody applications. However, the nylon
      microparticles possess marginally higher non-specific binding characteristics.

TI  - An enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay for the quantitation of the terminal
      complement complex from cell membranes or in activated human sera.
PG  - 217-25
AB  - A sensitive and simple enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) has been
      developed to measure the terminal complement complex (TCC) in solution.
      Commercially available antibodies to the native complement (C) components C5 and 
      C9 were used in a double antibody sandwich technique sensitive enough to detect
      0.3 microgram/ml of purified TCC. The TCC was not detected in normal human serum 
      (NHS) nor was it generated when sera from patients with a genetic deficiency of
      functional C5, C7, C8 beta or C9 were activated with cobra venom factor (CVF). If
      the C8 beta deficient serum was reconstituted with the C8 beta chain and
      incubated with CVF, TCC were formed and detected by the assay. In in vitro
      experiments, the TCC was detected in NHS activated by either the classical or
      alternative pathway even when there was no measurable consumption of C5, C8 or
      C9. In addition, adaptation of a detergent extraction procedure permitted the
      quantitation by the assay, of TCC which were generated on sensitized sheep
      erythrocyte membranes. Experiments to test sample handling conditions showed no
      generation of TCC in NHS after four freeze/thaw cycles and spontaneous formation 
      only if NHS had been incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. The TCC in
      zymosan-activated NHS were stable at 37 degrees C for 1 week. Patients with C
      activation associated diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis had increased
      levels of TCC that correlated with positive clinical tests for inflammation, even
      though C levels were normal when measured by routine techniques. These results
      suggest that this ELISA will provide a valuable tool for studying the role of C
      in the pathogenesis of C-mediated diseases and in examining the mechanism of
      tissue injury in in vitro experimental systems.

TI  - Discrimination of human cytotoxic lymphocytes from regulatory and B-lymphocytes
      by orthogonal light scattering.
PG  - 211-6
AB  - Light scattering properties of human lymphocyte subpopulations selected by
      immunofluorescence were studied with a flow cytometer. Regulatory and
      B-lymphocytes showed a low orthogonal light scatter signal, whereas cytotoxic
      lymphocytes identified with leu-7, leu-11 and leu-15 revealed a large orthogonal 
      light scatter signal. Two populations in light scatter histograms could be
      observed with monoclonal antibodies directed against determinants present on both
      regulatory and cytotoxic lymphocytes. By analysis of the lymphocytes of 16
      individuals we found a linear relation between the number of cells with a large
      orthogonal light scattering and the number of cytotoxic lymphocytes identified
      with leu-7, leu-11 and leu-15. These observations demonstrate physical
      differences between cytotoxic lymphocytes and regulatory and B lymphocytes.
      Moreover, the results suggest a method to estimate the amount of cytotoxic
      lymphocytes without using monoclonal antibodies.

TI  - Dot-immunobinding assay with monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies for the detection and
      quantitation of human IgE.
PG  - 195-202
AB  - This paper describes a dot immunobinding assay for determining total human IgE
      with a tandem of monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies. Minute quantities of monoclonal 
      anti-IgE antibodies were adsorbed on nitrocellulose discs. IgE bound to this
      solid phase monoclonal anti-IgE antibody was detected by a second monoclonal
      antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Using 4-chloro-1-naphthol as a
      chromogen results in a stable colour reaction that can be semiquantitatively
      analysed by the naked eye. The colour intensities of the reaction were also
      analysed by densitometry, yielding a very reproducible quantitation of human
      serum IgE. Using a serum dilution of 1:50, IgE could be detected in the range of 
      12.5-2500 U/ml. Using non-diluted serum samples IgE levels between 0.05-50 U/ml
      were reproducibly measured. Total serum IgE as determined by this dot assay
      correlated very well with IgE determinations performed by the commercial PRIST
      assay.

TI  - Specific IgE antibodies to reactive dye-albumin conjugates.
PG  - 177-86
AB  - Hypersensitivity to reactive dye powders has been recognised for a number of
      years, although the extent of sensitisation amongst dye house operatives and the 
      immunochemistry of the dye molecules has not been investigated. We have developed
      a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) to detect specific IgE to reactive dye-human
      serum albumin (HSA) conjugates. From a total of 19 dye-HSA conjugates, positive
      RASTs were found in six workers with allergic symptoms associated with dye
      exposure, while six asymptomatic case-matched controls were negative. Sera with
      raised total IgE (up to 4300 kU/l) from unexposed workers gave negative results
      except for two conjugates which gave a weak positive at 4300 kU/l and one which
      gave weak positives at all concentrations tested (750-4300 kU/l). RAST
      demonstrated that the antibody was specific for the complete dye-HSA conjugate.
      Substitution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) for HSA in the conjugate markedly
      reduced immunoreactivity and free hapten gave lower inhibition than the complete 
      conjugate. Comparison of the dye-HSA RAST with a RAST using dyed discs showed
      that the latter did not correlate well with symptoms and was influenced by the
      total IgE concentration.

TI  - An adjuvant formulation that selectively elicits the formation of antibodies of
      protective isotypes and of cell-mediated immunity.
PG  - 157-68
AB  - Adjuvants are required to elicit protective immune responses with bacterial
      toxoids, inactivated viruses and subunit antigens produced by recombinant DNA
      technology. Some adjuvants, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP) analog formulations, 
      preferentially induce the formation of antibodies of isotypes that interact with 
      complement and antibody-dependent effector cells, and do not elicit reaginic
      antibodies. Aluminum salts and mineral oil emulsions increase antibody formation 
      but not cell-mediated immunity (CMI), whereas MDP formulations also elicit CMI.
      Adjuvants such as MDP and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulate the production by
      accessory cells of IL-1 that increases the circulation of lymphocytes through
      draining lymph nodes and act as a growth factor for lymphocytes. Vehicles such as
      mineral oil emulsions, liposomes and Pluronic polymer formulations provide large 
      surface areas on which antigens can be retained in a two-dimensional matrix, from
      which they can readily be transferred to antigen-presenting cells. The
      development of an adjuvant formulation able to elicit the formation of protective
      antibodies and CMI without unacceptable side effects is described.

TI  - Interleukin-2 monoclonal antibody affinity adsorption. The critical role of
      binding kinetics for optimal immunoadsorption.
PG  - 237-48
AB  - With the ready availability of monoclonal antibodies reactive with an extensive
      spectrum of antigens, immunoaffinity adsorption has become more widely applicable
      for protein purification. However, given several monoclonal antibodies reactive
      with the same antigen, most investigators have found that only a few antibodies
      are useful for solid-phase immunoaffinity antigen purification. Accordingly, in
      order to determine the parameters of monoclonal antibody-antigen binding most
      important for effective immunoaffinity adsorption, equilibrium and kinetic
      binding experiments were performed using radiolabeled interleukin-2 (IL-2) as
      antigen and four different IL-2-reactive monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies
      were found to differ primarily with respect to their kinetic binding
      characteristics; at 37 degrees C IL-2 bound to two of these antibodies very
      rapidly, while it bound to the other two more slowly. When binding was performed 
      at 4 degrees C, the equilibrium dissociation constants for all of the antibodies 
      decreased due to a more marked prolongation of the dissociation rate than the
      association rate. However, at 4 degrees C the association rates of the two
      slow-reactive antibodies became retarded so markedly that efficient affinity
      adsorption did not occur. By comparison, for both of these antibodies, efficient 
      removal of IL-2 could be obtained if adsorption was performed at 37 degrees C,
      provided the column flow rate was adjusted according to the IL-2 association
      rate. Kinetic considerations also dictated IL-2 adsorption to mixtures of two or 
      more monoclonal antibodies: IL-2 immunoadsorption correlated with the association
      rates of the individual antibodies, rather than the equilibrium binding
      constants. These results indicate that the most important parameter for efficient
      affinity adsorption is the association rate constant. In addition, the results
      obtained indicate that monoclonal antibodies may differ markedly as regards their
      kinetic binding characteristics, and that all antibodies can serve as effective
      immunoadsorbents, provided their antigen binding characteristics are known.

TI  - Comparison of methods for freezing interleukin-dependent murine cell lines.
PG  - 203-10
AB  - Various methods for freezing several interleukin-dependent murine cell lines have
      been compared and were shown to differ in their efficacy from line to line. An
      interleukin-2-dependent cell line, T572.C5, which was more sensitive to
      dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) than the other cell lines, was the most difficult to
      freeze in a viable state. In order to define better conditions for freezing, the 
      effects of the changes in freezing rates and concentrations of DMSO and of the
      addition of Ficoll were determined. The optimal freezing rates and DMSO
      concentrations varied from line to line. The addition of Ficoll increased the
      viability in some, but not all, cell lines, depending on the freezing conditions 
      used. Thus, the optimal conditions for freezing interleukin-dependent cell lines 
      varied from line to line. In general, the direct freezing procedure was better
      than the styrofoam-box freezing method. Although programmed freezing under direct
      temperature control was the most suitable among the freezing procedures examined,
      unprogrammed procedures also were of practical use.

TI  - Human kappa light chain subgroup analysis with synthetic peptide-induced
      antisera.
PG  - 249-57
AB  - All human kappa light chains belong to one of four subgroups, classified
      according to their amino acid sequences or by reactivity with adsorbed
      heteroantisera. The structural basis for the subgroup distinction by antisera is 
      unknown. Therefore, to create anti-kappa subgroup antibodies with predefined
      specificity, we immunized rabbits with synthetic peptides which correspond to
      sequences within the first framework region of prototype kappa I, II, III, and IV
      light chains. The peptide-induced antisera recognized primary sequence-dependent 
      kappa subgroup determinants. They correctly predicted the amino acid sequence in 
      the first framework region of two kappa light chains. By Western immunoblotting
      and enzyme-linked immunoassay the antisera also identified previously typed,
      monoclonal light chains of different subgroups with complete specificity. These
      reagents, define a site of kappa subgroup distinction and represent a potent tool
      for the characterization of light chain heterogeneity.

AB  - Shigella sonnei phase II core oligosaccharide (OSPhII) was linked covalently with
      protein (bovine serum albumin or tetanus toxoid) to obtain a conjugate
      (OSPhII-protein) of good immunogenicity in rabbits. Anti-OSPhII-protein conjugate
      sera contained high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies against the complete

      lipopolysaccharides of R1, R3 and R4 core types using anti-OSPhII-protein sera
      were studied. These antisera may be used for the rapid determination of core
      types in unknown enterobacterial strains.

TI  - A competitive enzyme immunoassay of human beta 2-microglobulin based on
      separation by filtration.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - A competitive enzyme immunoassay has been developed for the determination of beta
      2-microglobulin in undiluted human serum. In the assay a beta
      2-microglobulin-beta-galactosidase conjugate competes with beta 2-microglobulin
      from the sample for the binding to anti-beta 2-microglobulin antibodies bound to 
      small size agarose particles (micro-Sepharose) via a double antibody. The
      conjugate is made by providing beta 2-microglobulin with 'reactive disulphide
      structures.' This is achieved by the heterobifunctional reagent SPDP and the
      subsequent linkage of the formed derivative to beta-galactosidase by a
      thioldisulphide exchange reaction. This procedure gives conjugates with high
      immunoreactivity and enzyme activity. The assay is fast and simple. The reagents 
      are incubated together for 60 min in the wells of a Millititer plate and
      separation is performed by filtration. Bound enzyme-labelled beta 2-microglobulin
      is measured by incubation with substrate for 15 min. Both incubations are
      performed at room temperature without agitation. Due to the high capacity of the 
      micro-Sepharose no sample predilution is needed. The use of the Millititer
      filtration system gives a rapid and efficient separation and the advantages of
      access to equipment for dispensing and reading adapted to the microtitre format.

TI  - An efficient and general method for sequencing immunoglobulin mRNAs.
PG  - 227-35
AB  - By using two oligonucleotide primers, one complementary to a short DNA segment in
      the first constant region exon and second complementary to a short segment in the
      variable region, we have developed a highly efficient method for sequencing
      immunoglobulin mRNAs. Using the first primer full length immunoglobulin-specific 
      cDNA was synthesized and separated on a denaturing acrylamide/urea gel. The
      desired band was isolated from the gel and sequenced by Maxam/Gilbert method.
      Using the sequence generated, a second oligonucleotide primer complementary to a 
      short segment in the variable region was synthesized and similarly used to
      complete the remaining sequence of the variable region, the signal peptide and
      the 5'-untranslated region. We have used this method to determine the complete
      nucleotide sequence of heavy and light chain mRNAs from two anti-idiotypic
      hybridomas. The method is generally applicable to sequencing immunoglobulin mRNAs
      from both myelomas and hybridomas especially in instances involving the
      expression of more than one heavy or light chain mRNAs as well as instances
      involving additional transcripts from aberrantly rearranged immunoglobulin genes.

TI  - Reduction of the volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area by
      in utero ethanol exposure in male rats.
PG  - 363-8
AB  - Ethanol consumption during pregnancy has been demonstrated to result in
      alterations in central nervous system structure and function. Albino female rats 
      were given either a liquid diet containing ethanol (5% w/v), a liquid diet which 
      contained maltose-dextrin substituted isocalorically for the alcohol, or
      laboratory chow and water throughout pregnancy and for 14 days following birth.
      The volumes of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) and 
      the nucleus accumbens septi (ACN) were measured in adult male rats exposed in
      utero and postnatally to these diets. Adult male rats exposed to ethanol in utero
      exhibit significantly smaller SDN-POA volumes (P less than 0.02) when compared to
      those of animals which received the control diets during the gestational period
      and postnatally. Ethanol treatment did not significantly influence the volume of 
      the ACN. The results indicate that maternal ethanol consumption during pregnancy 
      retards or inhibits SDN-POA development in fetal ethanol exposed male rats when
      compared to the nuclear volume in rats whose mothers were not exposed to ethanol 
      during pregnancy.

TI  - Carbachol phase shifts circadian activity rhythms in ovariectomized rats.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - Ovariectomy in the rat abolishes alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) binding within
      the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a putative circadian pacemaker, and markedly
      reduces cholinergic activation of SCN cells. Circadian rhythms of running wheel
      activity were monitored continuously in intact male and female and chronically
      ovariectomized rats before and after intraventricular carbachol injections.
      Carbachol produced similar phase shifts of the free-running rhythms in all
      groups. The results suggest that carbachol can influence the circadian system of 
      rats by activation of cholinergic receptor sites independent of those binding
      alpha-BTX within the SCN.

      and chemical stimuli: evidence for a new population of chemosensitive primary
      sensory afferents.
PG  - 352-6
AB  - In the skin activation of unmyelinated primary afferents produces vasodilation
      and plasma extravasation. Here, using Evans blue dye leakage, we have
      quantitatively compared the ability of mechanical, chemical and electrical
      stimulation of afferents to produce extravasation in the urinary bladder of
      anaesthetized rats. Mechanical stimulation - a series of large active
      contractions of vesical smooth muscle induced by maintained distension - elicited
      no increase in extravasation compared to controls. In contrast, a similar period 
      of electrical stimulation of nerves supplying the bladder, or chemical
      stimulation with intravesical instillation of mustard oil, produced high levels
      of extravasation. We conclude that afferents activated during distension and
      micturition contractions are different from those which produce extravasation.
      The latter may be important in pathophysiological cases such as inflammation of
      the urinary bladder.

PG  - 347-51
AB  - The effect of various nucleotides on the high affinity choline accumulation by
      synaptosomes from locusts has been studied. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate 
      (ATP) was found to inhibit the transport of choline, whereas the accumulation of 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid was not affected. The ATP-effect could not be mimicked by
      other purine derivatives, and seems not be mediated by purinergic receptors, but 
      rather hydrolysis of the phosphate appears to be essential.

      cultured mouse neural cells were treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific
      phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus. When live cultures of astrocytes and 
      neurons are treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, N-CAM120 
      is released into the supernatant. Under these conditions N-CAM140 and N-CAM180
      are not released. Phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens
      does not release N-CAM120. The embryonic form of N-CAM on astrocytes migrating as
      a broad band between 120 and 180 kDa is also partially released by
      phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C as a band migrating between 120 and
      160 kDa. These observations suggest novel mechanisms in regulation of N-CAM120
      expression on the cell surface and in modulation of N-CAM-mediated cell adhesion.

TI  - The agranular insular cortex: a site of unusually high dopamine utilisation.
PG  - 330-4
AB  - Dopamine (DA) utilisation (expressed as homovanillic acid:DA) was compared in the
      medial prefrontal cortex (FCx), the agranular insular cortex (AgCx), the
      caudate-putamen (medial, CPM and lateral, CPL divisions) and the nucleus
      accumbens (NAc). DA utilisation in these regions decreased in the order AgCx
      greater than FCx greater than CPM, CPL, NAc, whilst the concentration of DA
      decreased in the reverse order. Thus, although fewer DA neurones appear to
      innervate AgCx compared with FCx, the rate of DA utilisation/release is much
      greater in AgCx. It is suggested that this apparently more marked activity in DA 
      neurones innervating AgCx may reflect a relative lack of autoreceptor control.

PG  - 320-4
AB  - The effect of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) on extracellular levels of endogenous
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the striatum and frontal cortex
      of the halothane-anesthetized rat was studied using an intracerebral dialysis
      method. PCA (5 mg/kg s.c.) induced an immediate, marked release of 5-HT into
      dialysates collected from the frontal cortex and striatum, an effect which lasted
      over 2 h. This treatment also caused a marked release of DA in the striatum. The 
      results further emphasize the need to carefully assess the involvement of brain
      DA as well as 5-HT in PCA-induced behaviors.

PG  - 315-9
AB  - The effects of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on catecholamine (CA)
      secretion by isolated guinea pig adrenal medullary cells were studied. VIP (1
      microM) alone induced only a slight secretion of CA, but it stimulated
      ACh-induced CA secretion. At concentrations of 0.01-1 microM, it stimulated
      muscarine-induced CA secretion, but not nicotine-induced CA secretion. It did not
      affect high K+ or Ca2+ ionophore-induced CA secretion. The stimulatory effect of 
      VIP on muscarine-induced CA secretion was observed at muscarine concentrations of
      2 200 microM and was detectable after 2 min incubation.

PG  - 309-14
AB  - Sympathoadrenal medullary functions were investigated in stroke-prone
      spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) and in control normotensive Wistar-Kyoto
      rats (WKY) under halothane-anesthetized and resting conditions. The mean
      frequency of the spontaneous efferent activity of a single adrenal sympathetic
      nerve fiber was 1.08 +/- 0.11 impulses/s in WKY and 2.82 +/- 0.24 imp/s in
      SHR-SP, indicating a much higher level in SHR-SP than in WKY. The secretion rates
      of both adrenaline and noradrenaline from the adrenal gland were higher in SHR-SP
      than in WKY. The secretion rates of adrenaline and noradrenaline in WKY were 16.8
      +/- 3.0 and 1.70 +/- 0.09 ng/kg X min, respectively, while those in SHR-SP were
      36.7 +/- 3.9 and 2.56 +/- 0.18 ng/kg X min, respectively.

TI  - Some collicular efferent neurons code saccadic eye velocity.
PG  - 289-94
AB  - The activity of identified tecto-reticulo-spinal neurons (TRSNs) was studied in
      alert head-fixed cats during orienting towards moving visual stimuli. Eye
      movements and dorsal neck muscle activity were recorded simultaneously. Burst
      parameters of TRSNs showing visuomotor properties were analysed quantitatively.
      It could be demonstrated that some neurons generate presaccadic bursts whose
      instantaneous frequency profile is closely correlated with the profile of
      saccadic eye velocity. This correlation could be revealed only under conditions
      in which cats made orienting saccades to 'catch' a target moving in the preferred
      direction of the neuron's visual receptive field. Latency between bursts and
      saccades varied depending upon the degree of attention toward the target and
      saccade direction.

AB  - Visual and auditory evoked potentials were studied in the occipital, temporal,
      prefrontal and cingulate areas of the rat cerebral cortex. We found that both
      prefrontal and cingulate areas can respond to more than one sensory modality. The
      latencies of the response to light and sound, though slightly longer in these
      associative areas than in the two primary cortical regions, were still within the
      range of early sensory evoked responses (i.e. less than 50 ms).

TI  - Vasopressin administration prevents functional recovery of the vasopressinergic
      neurosecretory system following neurohypophysectomy.
PG  - 239-46
AB  - The rodent hypothalamic neurosecretory system normally exhibits remarkable
      functional and structural plasticity following injury. However, the present study
      describes a newly observed phenomenon in which neurohypophysectomized animals
      receiving chronically administered exogenous vasopressin during the post-lesion
      period (a treatment which insures maximal renal antidiuresis over this time
      frame) lose all capacity for recovery of antidiuretic function. Functional
      deficits are accompanied by a severe reduction in the number of neurons
      exhibiting immunohistochemical staining for arginine vasopressin. These data
      indicate that the presence of neurological stimulation signaling vasopressin
      release may play an important role in promoting neural regeneration of the
      vasopressinergic component of the neurosecretory system.

      system of rat commonly express apolipoprotein E during development but differ in 
      their response to injury.
PG  - 233-8
AB  - Macrophages have been identified by immunocytochemical methods in rat sciatic
      nerve neonatal development expressing significant amounts of apolipoprotein E
      (apo E). In contrast, in mature peripheral nerve apo E appears to be associated
      with the basal lamina. Following sciatic nerve crush apo E-immunoreactive
      macrophages reappear in the denervated distal stump within 3 days. In the optic
      nerve and spinal cord of newborn rat apo E is associated with the astroglia.
      During maturation of the central nervous system the number of apo
      E-immunoreactive astrocytes significantly increases, but as a specific response
      to injury this protein rapidly disappears from the astroglial cell bodies.

TI  - Hippocampal seizures and striatal regulation: a possible functional pathway.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - Experimental findings have suggested the possibility of a functional relationship
      between the basal ganglia and the hippocampus. Previous research has revealed a
      predominantly inhibitory action of the caudate nucleus (CN) and an excitatory
      effect of the globus pallidus (GP) on electrically induced hippocampal
      afterdischarges (HAD). The effects of electrolytic destruction of the CN on the
      threshold and duration of HAD has been studied in the 'encephale isole' cat. The 
      threshold and duration of HAD was also studied following conditioning stimulation
      of the CN in animals in which the inner segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and 
      medial septal nucleus (MSN) had been destroyed. Following CN lesions, the
      hippocampal excitability threshold underwent a significant reduction, while the
      duration of HAD appeared to be increased. Following destruction of the GPi and
      MSN, the threshold and duration of HAD exhibited no change following conditioning
      stimulation of the CN. The results reveal a tonic inhibitory effect of the CN on 
      the hippocampus and suggest that a strio-pallido-septal pathway is the anatomical
      substrate for the effect.

TI  - Induction of human leukocyte antigen-A,B,C and -DR on cultured human
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes by human gamma-interferon.
PG  - 369-74
AB  - gamma-Interferon (IFN-gamma) is known to induce expression of major
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens on murine astrocytes and MHC
      class I antigens on murine oligodendrocytes. We studied whether the human
      IFN-gamma could induce the expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A, B, C
      and -DR antigens on cultured human glia from autopsied brain white matter tissue.
      HLA-A, B, C antigens were induced on both human astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, 
      whereas HLA-DR antigens were induced only on some astrocytes. From these results,
      it is suggested that IFN-gamma affects the expression of MHC class I and class II
      antigens on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes derived from human brain. The
      relationship between the induction of MHC class I and class II antigens by
      IFN-gamma and the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis is discussed.

PG  - 300-4
AB  - An antiserum against carboxypeptidase H, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis
      of neuropeptides such as the enkephalins, was used to identify the enzyme
      proteins in bovine chromaffin granules. Two-dimensional immuno- and lectin-blots 
      revealed that two closely migrating glycoproteins which have been previously
      named J and K represented the enzyme. The same protein doublet was present in the
      membrane preparation and the soluble lysate of bovine chromaffin granules;
      however, the membrane contained significantly more enzyme protein.

TI  - Astrocyte glutamate receptor activation promotes inositol phospholipid turnover
      and calcium flux.
PG  - 335-40
AB  - Astrocyte-enriched cultures prepared from the neonatal rat cortex were
      prelabelled with either [3H]myoinositol or 45Ca2+ and then exposed to various
      excitatory amino acids. This resulted in an increase in both the breakdown of
      membrane inositol phospholipids and Ca2+ flux with the following rank order of
      efficacy: quisqualate greater than or equal to glutamate (Glu) greater than
      kainate much greater than N-methyl-D-aspartate. Experiments performed with the
      Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and in the absence of medium Ca2+ suggested that Glu-evoked
      45Ca2+ efflux was primarily the result of an increased influx of extracellular
      Ca2+. However, Glu-stimulated inositol lipid metabolism was found to be only
      partially dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The quisqualate-preferring receptor
      antagonist gamma-glutamylaminomethylsulphonic acid was found to be effective in
      reversing both Glu-evoked inositol lipid breakdown and Ca2+ flux. The results
      presented are suggestive of some form of interaction between Glu receptors
      coupled to inositol lipid turnover and Ca2+ channel opening in astrocytes.

AB  - By using indirect immunofluorescence, galactocerebroside (galC) was detected on
      the surface of Schwann cells cultured from unmyelinated fibers of 10- to
      12-day-old rat cervical sympathetic nerve trunk. By day 4 in vitro, galC-positive
      cells disappeared from the culture. When the 4-day cultures were treated with 1
      mM 8-bromo cyclic AMP or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, galC reappeared in 72 h. The
      proportion of Schwann cells expressing galC was dependent on the concentration of
      cyclic AMP derivatives used.

TI  - Tensor tympani reflex pathways studied with retrograde horseradish peroxidase and
      transneuronal viral tracing techniques.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - The neural pathway involved in activation of the tensor tympani (TT) muscle was
      studied in the rat using retrograde HRP and transneuronal viral tracing
      techniques. The pool of TT motoneurons labeled with HRP was located ipsilaterally
      under the anterior third of the trigeminal motor nucleus and extended rostrally
      towards the lateral lemniscus. The origin of the inputs to these motoneurons was 
      then determined using transneuronal viral transport: presumably transneuronally
      infected neurons appeared bilaterally in the vicinity of the superior olivary
      complex, mainly in between the two nuclei of the trapezoid body. The present data
      are consistent with previous conclusions based on lesion experiments that the TT 
      reflex loop is made up of a chain of 4 neurons.

TI  - Cerebral decortication reverses the effect of amphetamine on striatal D2 dopamine
      binding site density.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - Unilateral ablation of the cerebral cortex produces a decrease of approximately
      38% in striatal D2 dopamine binding site density. Chronic d-amphetamine treatment
      also produces a decrease of about 22% in D2 binding site density. Paradoxically, 
      when rats were hemidecorticated and treated chronically with d-amphetamine, the
      density of striatal D2 dopamine binding sites on the decorticated side was
      increased (by about 50%) rather than decreased. Evidently d-amphetamine-induced
      down-regulation of D2 dopamine binding sites depends on an intact corticostriatal
      pathway.

TI  - Different neuronal location of [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites in pars reticulata and
      pars compacta of the substantia nigra in the rat.
PG  - 265-71
AB  - The precise neuronal localization of D1 receptors in the substantia nigra has
      been studied autoradiographically in the rat by measuring the alterations of
      [3H]SCH 23390 binding site densities in this brain area after 6-hydroxydopamine
      (6-OHDA) induced destruction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and after
      ibotenate-induced lesion of striatal afferents. 6-OHDA-induced nigral lesion
      provoked a total loss of [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites in the pars compacta and
      pars lateralis (but not in the pars reticulata) of the substantia nigra. In
      contrast, ibotenate-induced striatal lesion caused a large diminution of the
      [3H]ligand binding site density in the pars reticulata but not in the pars
      compacta and pars lateralis of the substantia nigra. These results suggest that
      D1 receptors in the pars compacta or pars lateralis of the substantia nigra are
      located on the dopaminergic perikarya whereas those D1 receptors present in the
      pars reticulata of the substantia nigra lie on the terminals of nigral afferents 
      of striatal origin.

TI  - Evidence for galanin as an inhibitory neuropeptide on myenteric cholinergic
      neurons in the guinea pig small intestine.
PG  - 305-8
AB  - The effect of galanin on the [3H]ACh release from myenteric plexus-longitudinal
      muscle strips of the guinea pig small intestine was studied. While galanin did
      not alter the basal spontaneous efflux of ACh, it significantly depressed the ACh
      release evoked by electrical stimulation or caused by VIP and substance P. These 
      results suggest an important neuromodulatory role for galanin in the enteric
      nervous system.

TI  - Repetitive axonal discharges elicited by serotonin and intracellular adenosine
      3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in the crayfish neuromuscular junction.
PG  - 295-9
AB  - Experiments were carried out in the opener muscle of the claw of small crayfish. 
      After pretreatment of the preparation with serotonin (5-HT), application of the
      membrane permeant analogue of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP),
      8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-monophosphate was capable of evoking reversibly repetitive
      discharges in the inhibitory and excitatory axon. Reducing phosphodiesterase
      activity with application of either 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine or theophylline
      also elicited repetitive axonal discharges after 5-HT treatment. Moreover,
      application of forskolin dissolved in ethanol caused repetitive axonal
      discharges. The chemically induced presynaptic action potentials were detected
      mainly by their postsynaptic effects, i.e. by recording inhibitory and excitatory
      postsynaptic currents in voltage-clamped muscle fibres. In addition, nerve spikes
      were recorded extracellularly. It is concluded that 5-HT and intraaxonal cAMP
      alter membrane properties of the efferent axons innervating crayfish muscle.

TI  - Distribution of bombesin-like peptides in the alimentary canal of several
      vertebrate species.
PG  - 169-81
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitate and characterize the variants of
      bombesin-like immunoreactivity in the alimentary canal of the rat, rabbit, hawk, 
      owl, dog, monkey and human. Bombesin-like immunoreactivity was found throughout
      the entire gastrointestinal tract of all species studied. In the rat, the highest
      concentration of bombesin-like immunoreactivity was found in the colon. Gel
      chromatography showed that bombesin-like immunoreactivity corresponded to
      gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP-27) and GRP-10. In the dog, the greatest
      concentration of bombesin-like immunoreactivity was observed in the mucosal layer
      of the fundus, whereas the concentration of bombesin-like immunoreactivity in the
      muscle layer of the dog did not vary significantly from region to region. Gel
      chromatography showed that bombesin-like immunoreactivity in the dog corresponded
      to GRP-27, bombesin, GRP-10, and a smaller fragment. In the human, the
      concentration of bombesin-like immunoreactivity did not vary significantly from
      region to region in the mucosal and muscular layers. Gel chromatography of human 
      fundal mucosa showed that bombesin-like immunoreactivity peaks occur in the
      regions of GRP-27, bombesin and GRP-10. These findings substantiate the
      observation that bombesin-like peptides play a variety of roles in the regulation
      of gut function.

TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a mitogenic factor from bovine
      liver: structural homology with basic fibroblast growth factor.
PG  - 135-45
AB  - Two mitogenic peptides in bovine liver extract were purified to apparent
      homogeneity by monitoring the purification steps with two in vitro bioassays; one
      based on stimulation of adult bovine aortic arch endothelial cell proliferation
      and the other incorporation of [3H]thymidine to mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells. The
      purification procedure involved cation-exchange chromatography followed by
      affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and two steps of reversed-phase
      HPLC. The purified material showed the same biological activity as pituitary
      basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Amino acid analyses of the purified mitogen
      yielded a similar, but not identical composition to that of bovine pituitary
      basic FGF(1-146) reported previously. Gas-phase microsequencing identified two
      sequences in equal amounts in the purified preparation. Furthermore, the
      sequencing results are in accord with the theoretical data obtained when two
      truncated forms of basic FGF, corresponding to FGF(12-146) and (16-146), are
      being sequenced simultaneously. Basic FGF(12-146) is a novel truncated form of
      basic FGF which has not been isolated before although the (16-146) fragment has
      been found previously in kidney, corpus luteum, and adrenal. SDS-PAGE analysis
      could not separate the two forms and showed that both migrated as a protein of
      about 15,100 daltons, which is slightly smaller than intact basic FGF(1-146)
      (16,200 daltons). These results, taken together, indicate that at least some of
      the mitogenic activity in liver may be derived from basic FGF-related
      polypeptides.

      release.
PG  - 117-23
AB  - The electrically evoked release of radioactivity from mouse vas deferens and rat 
      hypothalamic slices preloaded with [3H]noradrenaline was measured. In addition
      the release of [3H]acetylcholine from longitudinal muscle strip of guinea-pig
      ileum was also measured. Neurochemical evidence has been obtained that
      neuropeptide Y (NPY), although it co-exists and is released with
      (-)-noradrenaline (NA), it behaves differently as far as its effect on
      presynaptic modulation of chemical neurotransmission is concerned. It exerts a
      frequency-dependent presynaptic inhibitory effect on noradrenaline release from
      mouse vas deferens but has no effect on the electrically evoked release of NA
      from rat hypothalamus. Unlike NA, NPY does not influence the release of
      [3H]acetylcholine from the longitudinal muscle strip of guinea-pig ileum and does
      not potentiate the presynaptic effect of NA. It seems very likely, that the
      inhibitory effect of NPY is mediated via receptors. Its action is concentration
      dependent. While exogenous noradrenaline inhibited the release of noradrenaline
      by 91%, the maximum inhibition reached with NPY was not higher than 60%,
      indicating that either the intrinsic activity of NPY is lower or much less axon
      terminals are equipped with NPY receptors. Peptide YY (PYY) also reduced the
      release of NA from mouse vas deferens.

TI  - Structure and expression of a second sea urchin U1 RNA gene repeat.
PG  - 9977-88
AB  - There are two tandemly repeated sets of U1 RNA genes in the sea urchin L.
      variegatus. Each of these genes is present in a 1.4 kb repeat defined by a
      HindIII site about 450 bases 5' to the gene. The sequences of a member of both
      repeating units (U1.1 and U1.2) has been determined. The repeats are nearly
      identical for 550 nucleotides 5' to the gene but show great divergence starting
      30 nucleotides 3' to the gene, just after the CAAAGAAAGAAAA sequence thought to
      be required for 3' end formation. The other boundary between the conserved and
      non-conserved sequences is a polypyrimidine sequence (on the strand which codes
      for U1 RNA). Both of these repeats are expressed in blastula stage embryos, as
      judged by transcription of unique sequences 3' to the gene in nuclei isolated
      from blastula stage embryos. At least some of the two types of repeats are
      interspersed, since representatives of both repeat types on a single gamma phage 
      isolated from a gene library. The sequence of the U1 RNA in L. variegatus eggs
      and embryos corresponds to the sequence of the U1 repeat.

TI  - Reverse Southern hybridization.
PG  - 9943-54
AB  - A DNA oligomer 25 nucleotides long which contained an HMT (4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',
      8-trimethylpsoralen) furan side monoadduct to thymidine at a 5'-TpA-3' site was
      used as a probe for the polylinker sequence present in single-stranded M13 mp19
      DNA and in double-stranded pUC 19 DNA. Hybridization and photofixation were
      carried out simultaneously in solution under conditions approximating the melting
      temperature of the probe-target hybrid. Use of probe concentrations greater than 
      10(-8) M permitted hybridization times of a few minutes. Irradiation with near
      ultraviolet light converted the HMT monoadduct present in hybrid complexes into
      an interstrand crosslink. Efficient photofixation removed hybrid from the
      equilibrium distribution and resulted in the formation of additional probe-target
      complex. After removal of excess probe by centrifugation through a semi-permeable
      membrane (Centricon-30), samples were electrophoresed through an alkaline agarose
      gel which was analyzed by autoradiography. When using an HMT-modified 25-mer
      probe end-labeled with 3,000 Ci/mmole 32P, 0.015 ng (3.8 X 10(6) copies) of M13
      DNA could be detected. With this same probe 10 micrograms of denatured human DNA 
      (corresponding to 3.0 X 10(6) copies) did not give a signal.

AB  - The 3'- and 5'-terminal sequences of the five large double-stranded RNA species
      (L-dsRNA; 4.5-6.0 X 10(6) daltons) of EP713, a hypovirulent strain of Endothia
      parasitica, were determined by mobility-shift and enzymatic methods. All the
      L-dsRNAs appeared to have identical terminal sequences. A heteropolymer sequence 
      was found at one 3'-terminus and a poly(A) sequence of variable length at the
      other. It was possible to label only one 5'-terminus using polynucleotide kinase 
      and [gamma-32P]ATP, and this was shown to be a poly(U) sequence of variable
      length. We propose that the dsRNAs have the following structure, where X
      represents a blocking group: (Formula: see text). A recombinant plasmid
      containing dsRNA-related sequences was constructed. Hybridization analysis using 
      the recombinant probe indicated that the sequence homology among the L-dsRNAs
      extended beyond these terminal regions and was also shared by small dsRNAs
      (0.3-0.45 X 10(6) daltons).

TI  - Tissue-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in a foreign globin gene in
      transgenic mice.
PG  - 9765-80
AB  - We have investigated the DNase I hypersensitivity of a hybrid mouse/human
      beta-globin gene in erythroid and non-erythroid cells of transgenic mice, to
      examine the relationship between the chromatin structure and the expression of an
      exogenous gene. The hybrid globin gene was previously shown to be expressed
      specifically in erythroid cells in some transgenic lines. The maximal level of
      hybrid globin mRNA accumulation was a few percent of the endogenous level, and we
      show here that this results from a low rate of transcription. In erythroid cells 
      from two transgenic lines in which the hybrid gene is expressed, we detect a set 
      of DNase I hypersensitive sites whose locations are indistinguishable from those 
      in endogenous beta-globin genes. The hybrid globin gene contains no DNase I
      hypersensitive sites in transgenic mouse brain cells. Thus, the tissue-specific
      expression of the exogenous globin gene is reflected in, and perhaps mediated by,
      tissue-specific changes in chromatin structure.

TI  - Three-arm nucleic acid junctions are flexible.
PG  - 9745-53
AB  - Nucleic acid junctions are stable analogs of branched DNA structures which occur 
      transiently in living systems. We show here that junctions which contain three
      double helical arms can be enzymatically oligomerized, using conventional
      sticky-ended ligation procedures, to create larger complexes. The products
      consist of a series of linked junctions separated by 20 base pairs. Junction
      dimers are formed that have free termini only, whereas trimers and larger species
      are found to be both unclosed and cyclized. The formation of a series of
      macrocyclic products which, surprisingly, begins with trimers and tetramers
      indicates that this junction is flexible about a bending axis, and perhaps
      twist-wise as well. We have obtained the same results from three different 3-arm 
      junctions, two in which the junction is flanked by a 3 Watson-Crick base pairs,
      and one in which a G-G base pair flanks the junction.

TI  - Structure of viroid replicative intermediates: physico-chemical studies on SP6
      transcripts of cloned oligomeric potato spindle tuber viroid.
PG  - 9613-30
AB  - The structure and structural transitions of transcripts of cloned oligomeric
      viroid were studied in physico-chemical experiments and stability calculations.
      Transcripts of (+) and (-) polarity, from unit up to sixfold length, were
      synthesized from DNA clones of the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) with the
      SP6 transcription system. Their structural properties were investigated by
      optical denaturation curves, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
      electron microscopy, sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium and velocity
      sedimentation. Secondary structures of the RNAs and theoretical denaturation
      curves were calculated using an energy optimization program. The secondary
      structure of lowest free energy for unit length and oligomeric transcripts is a
      rod-like structure similar to that of the mature circular viroids. When this
      structure is used as a model for calculations, there is a large degree of
      agreement between the theoretical and the experimental denaturation curves. At
      high temperatures, however, (+) strand transcripts exhibited a transition which
      was more stable than expected from the calculations or than was known from curves
      of mature viroids. This transition arises from a rearrangement of the central
      conserved region of viroids to a helical region of 28 stable base pairs either
      intermolecularly leading to bimolecular complexes, or intramolecularly giving
      rise to a branched secondary structure. The rearrangement could be detected by
      electron microscopy, HPLC, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The helical region
      serves to divide up the oligomeric (+) strand into structural units which may be 
      recognized by cleavage and ligation enzymes which process the oligomeric
      intermediates to circular mature viroids.

      introns. A search for possible branch points with sequences related to the yeast,
      vertebrate and fungal consensus sequences revealed a similar sequence in plant
      introns.

TI  - Circular dichroism of two conformations of poly[d(G-C)] induced by low pH.
PG  - 10091-112
AB  - Circular dichroism (CD) and UV absorption data showed that poly[d(G-C)] (at 0.09M
      NaCl, 0.01M Na+ (phosphate), 20 degrees C) underwent two conformational
      transitions upon lowering of the pH by the addition of HCl. The first transition 
      was complete at about pH 3.0. The second transition was complete upon lowering
      the pH to 2.6 or upon raising the temperature, at pH 3.0, to about 40 degrees C. 
      There was no indication of denaturation during either transition. The CD spectrum
      for the second acid conformation had large CD bands including a positive one at
      288nm, a characteristic associated with C X C+ base-pairs. Electron microscopy
      showed no significant formation of condensed supramolecular aggregates
      corresponding to the first or second acid forms of poly[d(G-C)]. On the basis of 
      spectral data, electron microscopy, and proton-uptake measurements, we propose
      models for the secondary structures that poly[d(G-C)] adopts in its two acid
      conformations.

TI  - Compilation and analysis of eukaryotic POL II promoter sequences.
PG  - 10009-26
AB  - A representative set of 168 eukaryotic POL II promoters has been compiled from
      the EMBL library and subjected to computer signal search analysis. Application of
      this technique to E. coli promoters as a control ensemble revealed the well known
      consensus sequences at -35 and -10 which indicates that the methods are adequate 
      to approach problems of this kind. The results obtained from the eukaryotic
      promoter set can be summarized as follows: Common sequence features are confined 
      to a region between -50 and +10 relative to the transcriptional initiation site. 
      The only well conserved consensus sequence is TATAAA, centered at -28. A weak
      motif, CA followed preferentially by pyrimidines, surrounds the cap-site. Two
      pentanucleotides which have been shown by experiments to stimulate transcription 
      of certain genes, GGGCG and CCAAT, are moderately over-represented in the
      upstream region (between -129 and -50). However, they occur at highly variable
      distances from the initiation site.

      University Chest Surgery Centre in 1980-1985. All patients were subjected to
      fibrobronchoscopy which revealed the tumour in 18 cases (14 were given multiple
      biopsies and in 4 cases samples could not be taken due to the patient's
      intolerance of the endoscopic manoeuvre). No appreciable bleeding occurred after 
      any biopsy. Surgery was performed on all 21 patients (2 pneumonectomies, 7
      bilobectomies, 12 lobectomies). There was 85.71% correspondence between pre and
      post-operative histological diagnosis.

AB  - Bronchial release appears to be regulated by the nonadrenergic noncholinergic
      system whose transmitter is very probably VIP. In vivo and in vitro studies were 
      conducted to discover whether peptide modifies basic function and/or bronchial
      spasm provoked by histamine. The data collected show that VIP failed to cause
      bronchodilation but protects against histamine induced bronchoconstriction both
      in vivo and in vitro.

TI  - [Bile acids in chronic hepatopathies].
PG  - 2287-92
AB  - The clinical value of measuring biliary acids in various chronic liver disease
      was investigated. The sample examined included 17 healthy subjects, 16 patients
      with active chronic hepatitis, 15 with cirrhosis of the liver and 14 with
      cholestatic cirrhosis. The following parameters were considered in each patient: 
      blood bilirubin, gamma GT, alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase, blood
      cholesterol, Quick time. The total pool of biliary acids was assayed by the
      enzymatic method on samples taken in the morning before breakfast and two hours
      after intake of 600 mg ursodeoxycholic acid. Total biliary increased with the
      progression of the pathological condition. Unlike all other indicators biliary
      acid assays after oral loading with ursodeoxycholic acid makes it possible to
      distinguish between subjects with active chronic hepatitis and those with
      cirrhosis of the liver.

PG  - 2277-86
AB  - The aim of the present work was to study gastric acid secretion in control
      subjects and in gastric and duodenal ulcer patients and to evaluate sex, age,
      body weight, blood group, cigarette smoking and the intake of H2-blockers in the 
      24 hours preceding gastric acid analysis. The results obtained seem to indicate
      that 6 micrograms/kg b.w./i.m. Pentagastrin is the best stimulus and that basal
      secretion may be assessed in thirty minutes, without altering the BAO value.
      Factors such as cigarette-smoking and H2-blockers intake on the one hand and body
      weight and male sex on the other influence gastric juice output and should
      therefore be considered in interpreting the results.

TI  - Vascular atrophy in the retinal degenerative rd mouse.
PG  - 543-53
AB  - We have observed that the lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA), which binds
      to terminal galactose moieties, serves as a marker for vasculature in the mouse
      retina. The binding of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated RCA was used to
      study the development of retinal vasculature in normal mice and in rd (retinal
      degeneration) mutant mice, which exhibit a massive loss of photoreceptor cells
      during the first month of life. In the normal mouse, retinal capillaries develop 
      in an ordered manner and are concentrated in three major zones between the inner 
      limiting membrane and the outer plexiform layer. In the rd mouse, the vessels
      appear to form normally but begin to degenerate by the end of the second
      postnatal week. By the end of the fourth postnatal week there is approximately a 
      35% reduction in the total number of vascular profiles in the rd retina compared 
      to normal littermate controls. This reduction in vascularity is temporally
      associated with the photoreceptor degeneration.

PG  - 529-42
AB  - The efferent pathways from the visual cortex to the dorsal lateral geniculate
      complex of turtles have been studied by using the orthograde and retrograde
      transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Injections of HRP in the lateral
      thalamus retrogradely label neurons throughout the visual cortex. The majority of
      labeled neurons have somata in layer 2 of the lateral part of dorsal cortex (D2);
      a minority have somata in layer 3. Labeled neurons in layer 2 tend to have
      vertically oriented, fusiform somata and dendrites that ascend into layer 1.
      Labeled neurons in layer 3 have fusiform somata and dendrites, both oriented
      horizontally. Injections of HRP in visual cortex orthogradely label corticofugal 
      axons. Those projecting to the lateral geniculate complex course laterally from
      the visual cortex, pass through the striatum (occasionally bearing varicosities),
      and enter the diencephalon in the ventral peduncle of the lateral forebrain
      bundle. Individual axons leave the ventral peduncle and run dorsally in the
      transverse plane, entering the dorsal lateral geniculate complex from its ventral
      edge. They continue dorsally, principally in the cell plate of the geniculate
      complex, where they bear varicosities.

TI  - Ultrastructural features and hormone-dependent sex differences of mormyrid
      electric organs.
PG  - 511-28
AB  - The electric organ of mormyrid fishes is composed of action potential-generating 
      cells called electrocytes that together produce a species-typical electric organ 
      discharge (EOD). The electrocytes of mormyrids are disc-shaped cells with
      distinct anterior and posterior faces, and a series of evaginations of one face
      that form a stalklike structure that is the site of innervation by spinal
      electromotoneurons (Bass: J. Comp. Neurol. 244:313-330, '86a). Here, we describe 
      the major ultrastructural features of mormyrid electrocytes, which include
      surface invaginations along each face, myonuclei, myofilaments, and
      neuromuscularlike junctions formed by the axons of spinal electromotoneurons. The
      degree of surface invaginations along the anterior face is the most dramatic
      interspecific variable and is usually greater for species with the longer
      duration EODs. Among species with sexually dimorphic EODs, natural males, or
      females treated with gonadal steroid hormones, have longer-duration EODs and
      thicker electrocytes with more surface invaginations along the anterior face. The
      results are discussed in relation to the action potential-generating properties
      of the electrocyte's membranes.

TI  - Map of retinal position onto the cross section of the optic pathway of goldfish.
PG  - 493-510
AB  - The position of a retinal cell is defined by the two polar coordinates: r, the
      distance from the optic disc, and theta, the angular (or clock-face) position.
      Axons of similar theta value were labeled by the punctate application of
      horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to optic axons in the retina, and axons of similar
      r-value were labeled by the application of this same marker to a tectal fascicle.
      Labeled axons were traced in serial transverse sections of the optic pathway from
      the retina to the tectum to learn the map of the retinal surface onto the cross
      section of the pathway. Retinas were flat-mounted and treated for HRP to show the
      retinal origins of the labeled axons. Axons of similar r were clustered together,
      and the fraction of the pathway's cross-sectional area occupied by the cluster
      was about the same as the fraction of the retinal area occupied by the group of
      labeled somata. Axons of similar theta were also clustered, but the fraction of
      the cross-sectional area they occupied was larger than the fraction of retinal
      area occupied by their somata. The geometry of the clusters of labeled axons
      depended on the proximodistal location in the pathway. Near the retina both were 
      strip-shaped, but the location and orientation of the strip varied. Both an
      r-strip and a theta-strip were labeled in some pathways by dual applications of
      HRP; the two strips were mutually orthogonal at all levels. Each of r and theta
      mapped onto a separate axis. The axons from most peripheral retina (largest r)
      were everywhere adjacent to the pia, and axons of progressively more central
      retina (smaller r) were progressively more separated from the pia (except in the 
      nerve, where the secondary fasciculation complicates the geometry by wrapping old
      axons in new pia). The map of the circular variable, theta, onto a line, required
      a discontinuity, the location of which differed, depending on the proximodistal
      level. From the retina to the chiasm, the discontinuity was at the ventral
      retinal radius (i.e., the right retinal clock-face positions were ordered
      6-9-12-3-6 o'clock across the line); just central to the chiasm, the fibers
      reordered to put the discontinuity at the nasal radius (clock-face positions
      ordered 3-6-9-12-3); at the brachial bifurcation, the 3-6-9 half turned dorsally,
      the 9-12-3 half, ventrally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Afferent and efferent connections of the dorsolateral precentral gyrus (area 4,
      hand/arm region) in the macaque monkey, with comparisons to area 8.
PG  - 460-92
AB  - The afferent and efferent connections of the dorsolateral precentral gyrus, the
      primary motor cortex for control of the upper extremity, were studied by using
      the retrograde and anterograde capabilities of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
      technique in three adult macaque monkeys that had received HRP gel implants in
      this cortical region. Reciprocal corticocortical connections were observed
      primarily with the supplementary motor area (SMA) in medial premotor area 6 and
      dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus, postarcuate area 6 cortex, dorsal cingulate 
      cortex (area 24), superior parietal lobule (area 5, PE/PEa), and inferior
      parietal lobule (area 7b, PF/PFop, including the secondary somatosensory SII
      region). In these heavily labeled regions, the associational intrahemispheric
      afferents originated primarily from small and medium sized pyramidal cells in
      layer III, but also from layer V. The SMA projections were columnar in
      organization. Intrahemispheric afferents from contralateral homologous and
      nonhomologous frontal and cingulate cortices also originated predominantly from
      layer III, but the connections from contralateral area 4 were almost exclusively 
      from layer III. The bilateral connections with premotor frontal area 6 and
      cingulate cortices were not observed with parietal regions; i.e., only
      ipsilateral intrahemispheric parietal corticocortical connections were observed. 
      There were no significant connections with prearcuate area 8 or the granular
      frontal (prefrontal) cortex. Subcortical afferents originated primarily from the 
      nucleus basalis of Meynert, dorsal claustrum, ventral lateral (VLo and VLc), area
      X, ventral posterolateral pars oralis (VPLo), central lateral and centromedian
      thalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, locus ceruleus
      and subceruleus, and superior central and dorsal raphe nuclei. Lesser numbers of 
      retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the nucleus of the diagonal band,
      mediodorsal (MD), paracentral, and central superior lateral thalamic nuclei,
      nucleus limitans, nucleus annularis, and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular 
      formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Embryogenesis of arborization pattern and topography of individual axons in N.
      laminaris of the chicken brain stem.
PG  - 425-59
AB  - This study examined the development of individual axon terminal fields in n.
      laminaris (NL) of the chicken brainstem. In their mature form axons from the
      nucleus magnocellularis (NM), second-order auditory neurons in the chicken
      brainstem, project bilaterally onto the NL. Axons from the ipsilateral and
      contralateral NM neurons form spatially segregated, elongated arbors in the
      dorsal and ventral neuropil of NL, respectively. The long axes of these arbors
      correspond to physiologically defined isofrequency bands. To assess the
      development of this stereotyped arborization pattern, 6-17-day embryonic chicken 
      brain stems were maintained in vitro while injecting horseradish peroxidase into 
      small groups of axons. Three-dimensional reconstructions were made from serial
      sections and projected onto a cartesian plane for quantitative analyses. At
      embryonic day 6 (E6), the ventral axons already course beneath the recently
      migrated NL neurons. The arrival of the dorsal NM axon branches is delayed and
      their paths are indirect. They first loop dorsally into the the ventricular
      layer, where they seem to make specific connections with migrating NL neurons and
      use these as guides to their appropriate positions in the NL. During the period
      from E9 to E17 the dorsal and ventral terminal fields become similar, each
      adopting properties of the other's initial pattern. The dorsal terminal fields
      extend to form bands similar to the early ventral terminal fields, while the
      ventral terminal fields narrow and appear to shift position in order to achieve
      the tonotopic specificity characteristic of the early dorsal terminal fields. The
      results show that a complex, mature pattern of neuronal connections can be formed
      during development by the combination and reorganization of two simple
      patterns--each shaped, in turn, by its respective axonal trajectory.

TI  - Sarcoid and cytotoxic lung antibodies.
PG  - 2435-40
AB  - Fifteen cases of Sarcoidosis were investigated for the presence of complement
      dependent cytotoxicity against human lung cells grown in tissue culture.
      Significant levels were found in eleven cases. Absorption studies revealed that
      these antibodies associated with sarcoidosis could be absorbed by human lung
      fibroblasts but not by fibroblasts derived from human foreskin or kidney.
      Although we found a similar antibody frequently associated with extrinsic asthma 
      we have only rarely found these antibodies in cases of tuberculosis, carcinoma of
      the lung, emphysema and intrinsic asthma.

TI  - Rapid-eye movement sleep and muscarinic receptor binding in rats are augmented
      during withdrawal from chronic scopolamine treatment.
PG  - 2419-27
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether a seven day, once-daily
      morning administration of scopolamine produces upregulation of muscarinic
      receptors and augments REMS during withdrawal. After obtaining two, six-hour
      baseline sleep recordings, beginning at 0900, independent groups of rats were
      administered either scopolamine or saline every morning for seven days. Six hour 
      sleep recordings were obtained following the first and seventh day of injection
      and during the two subsequent withdrawal days. After obtaining the last sleep
      recording the rats were sacrificed and the following brain areas removed:
      cerebral cortex, hippocampii, caudate nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellum. 3H-QNB
      was used as the ligand to assess for changes in muscarinic receptor binding.
      Compared to baseline, scopolamine produced a significant decrease in REMS during 
      the period of drug administration. During the withdrawal days, however, REMS
      increased during the morning period. Compared to the saline group, the
      scopolamine treated animals had increased muscarinic receptor binding in the
      caudate and hippocampus; no significant change in receptor density was observed
      in the cortex, brainstem or cerebellum.

TI  - Glutathione-induced inhibition of Na+-independent and -dependent bindings of
      L-[3H]glutamate in rat brain.
PG  - 2411-8
AB  - Reduced glutathione (GSH, 10(-7)-10(-3) M) was found to exert a profound
      suppressive action on the Na+-independent and -dependent bindings of
      L-[3H]glutamic acid (Glu) in a temperature-independent manner. Similarly
      significant reduction of the bindings resulted from the addition of oxidized
      glutathione (GSSG). Scatchard analysis revealed that GSH as well as GSSG
      invariably decreased the affinity of the binding sites for [3H]Glu without
      significantly affecting the number of the binding sites. These results suggest
      that GSH (GSSG) may in part participate in the synaptic transmission at central
      Glu neurons through interaction with the receptors and/or the uptake sites for
      Glu.

TI  - In vivo release of endogenous dopamine from rat caudate nucleus by
      beta-phenylethylamine and alpha,alpha,-dideutero-beta-phenylethylamine.
PG  - 2395-400
AB  - The release of endogenous dopamine (DA) has been measured in the rat striatum
      following the intracardial administration of various doses of
      beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) or alpha,alpha-dideutero-beta-phenylethylamine
      (deuterated PEA). The release was significantly increased for a period of
      approximately 15 minutes by a dose of 25 mg/kg PEA. Both the dose required to
      stimulate DA release and the duration of the effect were in good agreement with
      previously reported behavioral and locomotor effects of administered PEA. When
      the animals were given 25 mg/kg of deuterated PEA, the increase in DA release was
      both longer lasting and significantly greater in magnitude than that observed in 
      response to the non-deuterated amine. The results of these experiments provide
      direct evidence that DA release is stimulated by amounts of PEA known to cause
      behavioral effects and locomotor activity in rats, and suggest that these effects
      are likely to be mediated, at least in part, by DA.

TI  - Dopaminergic modulation of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system activity
      under stress.
PG  - 2387-93
AB  - The effects of the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine or the antagonist sulpiride
      on high affinity choline uptake and newly synthesized acetylcholine release by
      hippocampal synaptosomal preparations, were examined in rats subjected to
      immobilization stress. Increased dopamine uptake by septal synaptosomal
      preparations was taken as evidence for increased mesoseptal dopaminergic activity
      in response to stress. While apomorphine treatment failed to alter choline uptake
      or acetylcholine release in unhandled rats, it did however prevent the
      stress-induced increase in these cholinergic parameters. In contrast, after
      treatment with sulpiride both choline uptake and acetylcholine release were
      increased in unhandled rats, as they were after acute stress. Acute stress of
      sulpiride treated rats however resulted in changes similar to those produced by
      administration of either sulpiride or stress separately. We conclude that the
      mesoseptal dopaminergic system plays an important role in modulating the activity
      of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system under stress.

TI  - Peptide YY-like immunoreactivity in the central nervous system of the rat.
PG  - 157-68
AB  - The concentration of peptide YY (PYY)-like immunoreactivity in rat brain and
      spinal cord was determined by radioimmunoassay. The highest concentrations were
      found in the cervical spinal cord (18.1 +/- 1.3 ng/g, mean +/- S.E.M.) and in the
      medulla oblongata (16.3 +/- 1.5 ng/g). Lower amounts were found in the pons and
      in the hypothalamus. Chromatographic analysis of the PYY-like immunoreactivity
      from various regions of the brain revealed 95% of the immunoreactive material to 
      be indistinguishable from synthetic porcine PYY. PYY-immunoreactive nerve cell
      bodies could be demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in the medulla oblongata of
      colchicine-treated rats, the largest group of cells being found in the midline
      area between and partly in the raphe pontis and obscurus nuclei. Another large
      group of immunoreactive cells was detected more laterally in the medial parts of 
      the gigantocellular reticular nucleus. A few cells, finally, were seen in the
      dorsal parts of the medulla, including the nucleus of the solitary tract.
      Varicose nerve fibers displaying PYY immunoreactivity were observed in many parts
      of the hypothalamus, pons, medulla and spinal cord.

TI  - Adenosine modulation of fat cell responsiveness to insulin and oxytocin.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - We have investigated the effects of adenosine on the stimulation of glucose
      oxidation and lipogenesis by oxytocin and insulin in rat epididymal adipocytes.
      The addition of adenosine deaminase (1 U/ml) to the assay medium reduced the
      maximal oxytocin response (glucose oxidation and lipogenesis) to between 25 and
      50% of the maximum response in control cells. The maximal response to insulin was
      not appreciably affected under these conditions. The addition of adenosine (10 or
      30 microM) increased the cell sensitivity to oxytocin by elevating the maximum
      rate of oxytocin-stimulated glucose metabolism. Adenosine also increased the cell
      sensitivity to insulin by decreasing its ED50. A change in ED50, however, was
      observed only when control or adenosine-treated cells were compared to adenosine 
      deaminase-treated cells; but not when control and adenosine-treated cells were
      compared. On its own, adenosine also caused an appreciable increase in both
      glucose oxidation and lipogenesis (ED50 approximately equal to 3 microM
      adenosine). The difference in the effect of adenosine on oxytocin action,
      compared with the effect on insulin action, points to differences in the
      mechanisms by which insulin and oxytocin stimulate glucose metabolism in
      adipocytes.

TI  - Sequence and expression of four mutant aspartic acid tRNA genes from the
      mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 9561-78
AB  - Expression of the mitochondrial tRNAAsp gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been
      examined in five syn- mutants known to affect tRNAAsp function, and in a rho-
      mutant which accumulates precursor tRNAs. By comparison of wild-type versus
      mutant DNA sequence, the lesion in each syn- mutant has been identified as a
      single base change within the mitochondrial tRNAAsp structural gene. The mutant
      tRNAAsp genes are transcribed, and the transcripts can be processed to mature
      4S-size tRNAAsp. The steady-state level of each mutant tRNAAsp is lower than that
      of wild-type tRNAAsp. The RNA from two of the syn- mutants contained a second,
      slow-migrating form of mitochondrial tRNAAsp which is correctly processed at the 
      5' end. We conclude that the lesions in the syn- mitochondrial tRNAAsp genes
      block neither transcription of these genes, nor 5'-end processing of the
      transcripts. The effect of each point mutation must be manifested at the level of
      3'-end processing, or at a functional level.

TI  - A rapid method for determining tRNA charging levels in vivo: analysis of yeast
      mutants defective in the general control of amino acid biosynthesis.
PG  - 10045-51
AB  - We describe a simple method to quantitate the intracellular levels of charged
      tRNA species representing all 20 amino acids. Small RNA species are isolated from
      yeast cells under conditions where amino acids remain bound to their cognate
      tRNAs. After chromatographic removal of free amino acids, the tRNAs are
      discharged, and the amounts of the released amino acids are then quantitated.
      This method was applied to yeast cells from a wild type strain and from three
      mutant strains that are defective both in the general control of amino acid
      biosynthesis and in protein synthesis. Two of these mutant strains, previously
      shown to be defective in the methionine or isoleucine tRNA synthetases,
      respectively contain undetectable amounts of charged methionine or isoleucine
      although their levels of the remaining 19 amino acids are similar to a wild type 
      strain. In contrast, a gcd1 mutant strain has normal levels of all 20 amino-acyl 
      tRNA species. Thus, gcd1 strains are defective in general control of amino acid
      biosynthesis for reasons other than artifactual starvation of an amino acid due
      to a failure in tRNA changing.

TI  - [Correlation between the metabolic follow-up and diabetic retinopathy].
PG  - 2311-8
AB  - The state of the fundus oculi was investigated in 40 insulin-dependent and 20
      non-insulin dependent diabetics. In both groups the state of the fundus oculi was
      correlated with total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, glycosylated haemoglobin, platelet
      adhesiveness, triglycerides and duration of the disease. In the case of
      insulin-dependent diabetics a correlation was also sought with daily doses of
      insulin. The fundus oculi was normal in 21/40 insulin-dependent and 14/20
      non-insulin-dependent subjects. Multiple regression showed a positive correlation
      between insulin-HbA doses and duration of the disease and the fundus oculi.
      Simple liner regression showed a negative correlation between insulin doses and
      fundus, a tendentially positive correlation between platelet adhesion and fundus.
      A positive correlation between LDL-platelet adhesion and fundus was also shown in
      the non-insulin-dependent subjects. These results suggest that factors held to
      influence macroangiopathy also have an effect on macroangiopathy, that the check 
      up of diabetics is important for the prevention of retinopathy, that insulin
      doses should be strictly limited to the necessary amount for the control of
      diabetes since excess is as harmful as insufficiency.

TI  - [General cardiocirculatory effects in chronic respiratory insufficiency].
PG  - 2293-8
AB  - Blood gas and haemodynamic changes caused by chronic respiratory insufficiency
      affect the right ventricle and produce chronic cor pulmonale. Equally important
      but less well known modifications affect the left ventricle and the general
      circulation and are the subject of the present report. Hypoxemia, hypercapnia and
      acidosis caused by severe hypoxia create functional disturbances in both
      ventricles that are manifested in a volume overload that added to other major
      malfunctions provoke congestive heart failure. The coronary circulation is
      affected by metabolic factors, perfusion alterations, right ventricular
      hypertrophy and concomitant coronary lesions. Advanced respiratory insufficiency 
      caused by poorly compensated respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis reduces 
      cardiac output and frequency so that tissue perfusion is compromised. Furthermore
      alterations in transmembrane electrolytic concentrations produce repeated
      multifocal ventricular arrhythmias that expose the patient to the risk of sudden 
      death. Cardiac failure is reflected in other organs like the kidney and the
      central nervous system and also contributes to tissue and cerebral hypoxia. The
      later depresses the respiratory centres and develops into often irreversible
      coma. A better knowledge of these elements may contribute to the development of
      appropriate treatment.

PG  - 2463-74
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate further the CNS actions of commonly
      employed antihypertensive drugs. Measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      plasma catecholamines (CA) were made in an attempt to estimate the activity of
      central and peripheral noradrenergic neurons during treatment with or after
      abrupt discontinuation of treatment with clonidine (CLO), propranolol (PRO),
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or placebo, in patients with essential hypertension. A
      randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, single-blind design was employed. BP
      reductions equal to or greater than 10 mmHg were observed with CLO (0.36 +/- 0.07
      mg daily), PRO (160 mg +/- 0 mg daily) or HCTZ (70 +/- 12 mg daily). CLO reduced 
      plasma norepinephrine (NE) by 64% and PRO increased it by 25%. Neither HCTZ nor
      placebo modified plasma NE. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was reduced by PRO (51%, 
      P less than 0.01) and CLO (35%, P less than 0.05). CSF-NE levels (pg/ml) were
      significantly lower in the CLO group (CLO: 175 +/- 23; PRO: 278 +/- 35; HCTZ: 255
      +/- 34; placebo: 203 +/- 7).

TI  - How do the polyene macrolide antibiotics affect the cellular membrane properties?
PG  - 257-304
AB  - In the 1970's great strides were made in understanding the mechanism of action of
      amphotericin B and nystatin: the formation of transmembrane pores was clearly
      demonstrated in planar lipid monolayers, in multilamellar phospholipid vesicles
      and in Acholeplasma laidlawii cells and the importance of the presence and of the
      nature of the membrane sterol was analyzed. For polyene antibiotics with shorter 
      chains, a mechanism of membrane disruption was proposed. However, recently
      obtained data on unilamellar vesicles have complicated the situation. It has been
      shown that: membranes in the gel state (which is not common in cells), even if
      they do not contain sterols may be made permeable by polyene antibiotics, several
      mechanisms may operate, simultaneously or sequentially, depending on the
      antibiotic/lipid ratio, the time elapsed after mixing and the mode of addition of
      the antibiotic, there is a rapid exchange of the antibiotic molecules between the
      vesicles. Although pore formation is apparently involved in the toxicity of
      amphotericin B and nystatin, it is not the sole factor which contributes to cell 
      death, since K+ leakage induced by these antibiotics is separate from their
      lethal action. The peroxidation of membrane lipids, which has been demonstrated
      for erythrocytes and Candida albicans cells in the presence of amphotericin B,
      may play a determining role in toxicity concurrently with colloid osmotic effect.
      On the other hand, it has been shown that the action of polyene antibiotics on
      cells is not always detrimental: at sub-lethal concentrations these drugs
      stimulate either the activity of some membrane enzymes or cellular metabolism. In
      particular, some cells of the immune system are stimulated. Furthermore, polyene 
      antibiotics may act synergistically with other drugs, such as antitumor or
      antifungal compounds. This may occur either by an increased incorporation of the 
      drug, under the influence of a polyene antibiotic-induced change of membrane
      potential, for example, or by a direct interaction of both drugs. That fungal
      membranes contain ergosterol while mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol, 
      has generally been considered the basis for the selective toxicity of
      amphotericin B and nystatin for fungi. Actually, in vitro studies have not always
      borne out this assumption, thereby casting doubt on the use of polyene
      antibiotics as antifungal agents in mammalian cell culture media.(ABSTRACT

TI  - The murine interleukin 1 beta gene: structure and evolution.
PG  - 9955-63
AB  - We have isolated from a genomic library a murine recombinant clone containing the
      gene coding for interleukin-1 beta m-RNA. A 7000 b.p. DNA fragment has been
      sequenced. Sequences homologous with human IL-1 beta cDNA have been found
      distributed within 7 exons. The translation of these sequences allows the
      prediction of a protein 269 aminoacids long. Hybridization of P388D1 RNA from
      cells stimulated with phorbol myristic acetate with a genomic DNA probe shows the
      existence of a 1.6 Kb murine IL-1 beta mRNA which is absent in the unstimulated
      cells. The comparative analysis between the murine IL-1 beta and the human IL-1
      alpha genes shows extreme conservation of the aminoacids at the exon junctions.
      This observation together with the similarity in number and size of the exons
      suggests that these genes have diverged from a common ancestor.

AB  - c-myc RNA rapidly decreases to barely detectable levels in Friend erythroleukemia
      cells induced to differentiate upon the addition of dimethylsulfoxide. We show
      here that c-myc gene is down-regulated both at the transcriptional level
      presumably by a block in the elongation of primary transcripts and at the
      post-transcriptional level by an increase in the degradation of its mRNA.

PG  - 9897-909
AB  - Human lung epithelioid cells were treated with Benzo (a) pyrene diol epoxide
      (anti) in order to establish the binding and removal of covalent adducts in
      chromosomal components. Isolating two different classes of mononucleosomes, it
      was found that their DNA contained different concentrations of B(a)PDE-DNA
      adducts, while in both these mononucleosomal preparations only histones H2A and
      H3 contained detectable amounts of the carcinogen. Further analysis showed that
      in the intact human cell the carcinogen-DNA adduct distribution is constantly
      changing as a function of differential accessibility and repair. These results
      emphasize the dynamics of chromatin-carcinogen modifications.

TI  - Ascorbic acid enhances the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone from 
      the mediobasal hypothalamus in vitro.
PG  - 2447-54
AB  - Ascorbic acid is frequently used in in vitro studies of neurotransmitter-evoked
      release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) from hypothalamic
      fragments. Although it is assumed that ascorbate merely prevents the oxidative
      degradation of catecholamines, we have discovered that ascorbic acid itself
      produces significant increases in the release of LHRH. Our studies showed that
      ascorbic acid, at concentrations below 1 mM, produced a dose-dependent release of
      LHRH from incubated rat mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). The magnitude of the
      ascorbate-induced release was in the range of 100-200% above controls;
      significant amounts of LHRH were released only if the MBH were incubated with
      ascorbate for time periods longer than 30 minutes. We also found that
      ascorbate-induced increases in LHRH were equivalent to those produced by another 
      LHRH secretagogue, naloxone, and that the combined effects of the two substances 
      were additive in nature. Although the mechanisms underlying this effect are not
      fully understood, nonspecific chemical reduction is probably not a factor since
      sodium metabisulfite did not induce the release of LHRH. It seems probable that
      ascorbate may enhance the activity of endogenous norepinephrine in the MBH and,
      thereby, lead to increased release of LHRH.

PG  - 2429-34
AB  - The influence of pertussis toxin on the effects of guanine nucleotide on
      adenylate cyclase activity were investigated in rat striatal membranes. GTP
      promoted and inhibited the activity at 1 and 100 microM, respectively. The
      inhibitory effects of GTP were abolished by pretreatment of the membranes with
      pertussis toxin. GppNHp (guanyl-5'-y1-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate) exerted only
      stimulatory effects and pertussis toxin did not affect the effects of GppNHp. GDP
      at 10 and 100 microM caused significant inhibition which was completely
      suppressed by pertussis toxin. It is suggested that guanine nucleotide regulates 
      the affinity of as in stimulatory GTP-binding regulatory protein to either beta
      gamma or catalytic units of adenylate cyclase in a flip-flop manner. Inhibitory
      GTP-binding regulatory protein seems to play a regulatory role in inhibiting
      alpha s activity supplying the beta gamma heterodimer.

TI  - Compensatory increase in adrenomedullary angiotensin-converting enzyme activity
      (kininase II) after unilateral adrenalectomy.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, EC 
      3.4.15.1) was characterized in the adrenal medulla of male Sprague-Dawley rats.
      Rat adrenal medulla and lung ACE were similar in their susceptibility to Cl-
      activation and to the inhibition by EDTA, captopril, bacitracin and thiorphan,
      suggesting that rat adrenal medulla and lung ACE have similar properties. Changes
      in right adrenal weight and in adrenomedullary ACE activity 5 and 12 days
      following left unilateral adrenalectomy (UADX) were examined. Compensatory
      adrenocortical hypertrophy 12 days following UADX was associated with a
      significant increase in adrenal medullary ACE activity. This change was due not
      to a modified affinity of ACE for the substrate but to an alteration in ACE
      maximal velocity or number of available molecules. UADX had no effect on
      adrenocortical ACE activity. When UADX was combined with right splanchnic
      denervation, the increase in adrenomedullary ACE activity was blocked. The
      results support the existence of a functional ACE in adrenal medulla that is
      under neuronal control.

TI  - Iodinated derivatives of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are agonists
      at the cat pancreas and the rat submandibular salivary gland.
PG  - 183-8
AB  - Porcine VIP was iodinated by the chloramine-T method. The reaction products,
      which were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography, included residual
      native VIP, oxidized VIP and at least two iodinated VIP species. The iodo-VIP
      derivatives were recognized by antibodies raised against VIP and by VIP
      receptors. Furthermore, they appear to be approximately equipotent agonists to
      VIP in activating the adenylate cyclase in membranes from the rat submandibular
      salivary gland and in the stimulation of pancreatic secretion in vivo.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence and organization of dnaB gene and neighbouring genes on the
      Bacillus subtilis chromosome.
PG  - 9989-99
AB  - A region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome containing dnaB, a gene essential
      for the initiation of chromosomal replication in B. subtilis, was cloned and
      nucleotide sequence of some 5000bp determined. The region consists of 4 open
      reading frames (ORFs) possibly comprising a single transcriptional unit. Two dnaB
      mutations, dnaB27 and dnaB19 were located within the first ORF which would give
      rise to a protein of 472 amino acids. The dnaB27 mutation involves codon at the
      position of 122 (replacement of Asp by Asn) close to a DNA binding domain and the
      dnaB19 codon 379 (replacement of Ala by Thr) close to a region rich in charged
      amino acids which may be alpha helical. The third ORF in the same transcriptional
      unit would produce a hydrophobic protein which might be involved in the
      DNA-membrane binding function of dnaB gene. No homologous Escherichia coli genes 
      have been found.

AB  - Non-radioactive nucleic acid hybridization probes have been constructed in which 
      the reporter group is long chain biotin chemically linked to a basic
      macromolecule (histone H1, cytochrome C or polyethyleneimine). The modified basic
      macromolecule which carries many biotin residues can, in turn, be covalently
      linked to nucleic acids (DNA) via the bifunctional cross-linking reagents,
      glutaraldehyde, 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane, bis (succinimidyl) suberate or bis
      (sulfonosuccinimidyl) suberate. This provides a very sensitive probe by which as 
      little as between 10-50fg of target DNA can be visualized using dot-blot
      hybridization procedures in conjunction with avidin or streptavidin enzyme
      conjugates.

      octopine Ti plasmid: significant homology between virG and the regulatory genes
      ompR, phoB and dye of E. coli.
PG  - 9933-42
AB  - The entire nucleotide sequence of the virG locus, from the octopine Ti plasmid of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 15955, has been determined. The virG gene is 801
      nucleotides in length and has one open reading frame which encodes a protein of
      Mr 29,995. The virG gene is involved in the transcriptional activation of the Ti 
      plasmid vir-loci, which occurs after induction by specific compounds present in
      plant exudate. Sequence analysis of the Agrobacterium virG protein showed
      significant homology with the Escherichia coli ompR, phoB and dye proteins, which
      are all positive regulatory genes for genes encoding envelope proteins. These
      results suggest that the virG gene encodes a positive regulatory protein which
      can activate vir gene expression.

TI  - Alternative splicing of SV40 early pre-mRNA in vitro.
PG  - 9911-26
AB  - Simian virus 40 (SV40) early pre-mRNA is spliced using either of two alternative 
      5' splice sites and a common 3' splice site to produce two mRNAs that encode the 
      T and t antigens. We have studied alternative splicing of SV40 early pre-mRNA in 
      vitro using a HeLa cell nuclear extract. Synthetic SV40 early transcripts are
      processed to T and t antigen mRNAs in vitro. As in SV40-infected cells in vivo,
      cleavage at the T antigen 5' splice site is more efficient than cleavage at the t
      antigen 5' splice site in vitro, although both of these 5' splice sites are
      utilized relatively inefficiently in vitro. The ratio of cleavage at the T and t 
      antigen 5' splice sites is not changed significantly by a number of alterations
      in the conditions under which the in vitro splicing reactions are carried out.

TI  - Characterization of bone PG II cDNA and its relationship to PG II mRNA from other
      connective tissues.
PG  - 9861-76
AB  - Two cDNA clones encoding the small proteoglycan II (PG II) of bone were isolated 
      from a lambda gt11 expression library. These clones expressed recombinant protein
      which was cross-reactive with polyclonal and monoclonal antisera to PG II
      molecules from several connective tissues. The longest clone, lambda Pg 20 was
      studied in detail. The clone was shown to encode PG II by hybrid selected
      translation and immunoprecipitation. Northern analysis showed two species of the 
      PG II message of approximately 1.4 and 1.8 kb. Substantial amounts of PG II
      message were found in bone, tendon, articular cartilage, skin, smooth muscle and 
      cornea. Trace amounts of message were also detected in liver and brain.
      Radiolabeled bovine PG II cDNA hybridized to RNA from several other species
      including the human, rat and chicken. The level of PG II mRNA in chick embryonic 
      fibroblasts was sensitive to transformation by Rous sarcoma virus.

TI  - Methylated DNA-binding protein from human placenta recognizes specific methylated
      sites on several prokaryotic DNAs.
PG  - 9843-60
AB  - Methylated DNA-binding protein (MDBP) from human placenta recognizes specific DNA
      sequences containing 5-methylcytosine (m5C) residues. Comparisons of binding of
      various prokaryotic DNAs to MDBP indicate that m5CpG is present in the
      recognition sites for this protein but is only part of the recognition sequence. 
      Specific binding to MDBP was observed for bacteriophage XP12 DNA, which naturally
      contains approximately 1/3 of its residues as m5C, and for Micrococcus luteus
      DNA, M13mp8 replicative form (RF) DNA, and pBR322 when these three DNAs were
      methylated at CpG sites by human DNA methyltransferase. Five DNA regions binding 
      to MDBP have been localized by DNase I footprinting or restriction mapping in
      methylated pBR322 and M13mp8 RF DNAs. A comparison of their sequences reveals a
      common 5'-m5CGRm5CG-3' element or closely related sequence in which one of the
      m5C residues may be replaced by a T. In addition to this motif, one upstream and 
      one downstream m5CpG as well as other common residues over an approximately 20-bp
      long region may be recognized by MDBP.

TI  - Functional, developmentally expressed genes for mouse U1a and U1b snRNAs contain 
      both conserved and non-conserved transcription signals.
PG  - 9811-25
AB  - Four genes that encode mouse U1a1, U1b2 and U1b6 snRNAs have been isolated from a
      mouse genomic DNA library. They all appear to be functional U1 genes since they
      are accurately transcribed into full length, capped snRNAs upon injection into
      Xenopus oocytes. A mouse pseudogene that is not transcribed in Xenopus oocytes
      was also isolated from the mouse genomic library. DNA sequence analysis of the 5'
      and 3' flanking regions of the functional genes revealed the presence of three
      highly conserved sequence elements that have been shown to be required for
      transcription initiation or 3' end formation in other U1 genes. Each of these U1 
      RNA genes also contains non-conserved sequences in the 5' flanking region that
      could function in their controlled expression during development.

TI  - A bacterial protein requirement for the bacteriophage lambda terminase reaction.
PG  - 9797-809
AB  - The bacteriophage lambda terminase enzyme cleaves the cohesive-end sites of
      lambda DNA to yield the protruding 5'-termini of the mature molecule. In vitro,
      this endonucleolytic event requires a protein factor which has been isolated and 
      purified from extracts of uninfected E. coli. The terminase host factor (THF) is 
      a heat stable basic protein of M.W. approximately 22,000. The integration host
      factor (IHF) protein of E. coli can efficiently substitute for THF in the
      terminase reaction; however, THF can be demonstrated to be physically present in,
      and isolated with full biological activity from extracts of cells defective or
      deficient in IHF.

TI  - A novel chlorophyll a/b binding (Cab) protein gene from petunia which encodes the
      lower molecular weight Cab precursor protein.
PG  - 9781-96
AB  - The 16 petunia Cab genes which have been characterized are all closely related at
      the nucleotide sequence level and they encode Cab precursor polypeptides which
      are similar in sequence and length. Here we describe a novel petunia Cab gene
      which encodes a unique Cab precursor protein. This protein is a member of the
      smallest class of Cab precursor proteins for which no gene has previously been
      assigned in petunia or any other species. The features of this Cab precursor
      protein are that it is shorter by 2-3 amino acids than the formerly characterized
      Cab precursors, its transit peptide sequence is unrelated, and the mature
      polypeptide is significantly diverged at the functionally important N terminus
      from other petunia Cab proteins. Gene structure also discriminates this gene
      which is the only intron containing Cab gene in petunia genomic DNA.

TI  - Tricircular mitochondrial genomes of Brassica and Raphanus: reversal of repeat
      configurations by inversion.
PG  - 9755-64
AB  - We constructed complete physical maps of the tripartite mitochondrial genomes of 
      two Crucifers, Brassica nigra (black mustard) and Raphanus sativa (radish). Both 
      genomes contain two copies of a direct repeat engaged in intragenomic
      recombination. The outcome of this recombination in black mustard is to
      interconvert a 231 kb master chromosome with two subgenomic circles of 135 kb and
      96 kb. In radish, a 242 kb master chromosome interconverts with subgenomic
      circles of 139 kb and 103 kb. The recombination repeats are 7 kb in size in black
      mustard and 10 kb in radish, and are nearly identical except for two insertions
      in the radish repeat relative to the black mustard one. The two repeat
      configurations present on the master chromosome of black mustard are located on
      the subgenomes of radish and vice-versa. To explain this, we postulate the
      existence of an evolutionarily intermediate mitochondrial genome in which the
      recombination repeats were (are) present in an inverted orientation. The
      recombination repeats described for these two species are completely different
      from those previously found in the closely related species B. campestris,
      implying that such repeats are created and lost frequently in plant mitochondrial
      DNAs and making it less than likely that recombination occurs in a site-specific 
      manner.

TI  - D protein of miniF plasmid acts as a repressor of transcription and as a
      site-specific resolvase.
PG  - 9713-28
AB  - Two activities of the D protein of the miniF plasmid have been found. Divergent
      promoters in ori-1 ("primary" replicative origin) of miniF are both repressed in 
      cells which produce D protein. The mobilization of plasmids containing the ori-1 
      region by the F conjugation system is also repressed by D protein. In the former 
      case D appears to act as a transcriptional repressor, whereas in the latter case 
      D protein acts by resolving cointegrates of F and the mobilized plasmid. D
      protein resolves dimers whose monomer units contain the rfsF sequence needed for 
      recA-independent, site-specific recombination of F. The nucleotide sequence of
      the D gene was determined. The D gene region contains two oppositely-oriented
      open reading frames which have the same reading phase and substantially overlap. 
      Transposon insertion mutants were used to show that the gene for D protein
      occupies the top-strand (left-to-right) open reading frame.

TI  - The miniF plasmid C protein: sequence, purification and DNA binding.
PG  - 9699-712
AB  - The C (pifC) protein of miniF represses transcription of its own gene by binding 
      to the pif operator (pifO); it is also needed for replication initiated from the 
      miniF primary origin (ori-1). We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the C
      gene. The gene has been inserted into an expression vector under Ptrp control
      where it is expressed at high levels. The C protein has been purified from cells 
      carrying the Ptrp-C plasmid, and a preliminary study of C protein-DNA binding
      properties has been carried out. C protein binds strongly to pifO, and weakly to 
      sequences in the ori-1 region.

TI  - Inhibition of restriction endonuclease Nci I cleavage by phosphorothioate groups 
      and its application to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis.
PG  - 9679-98
AB  - M13 RF IV DNA where phosphorothioate groups are incorporated at restriction
      endonuclease Nci I recognition sites in the (-)strand is efficiently nicked by
      the action of this enzyme. Incubation of such nicked DNA with exonuclease III
      produces gapped DNA. The gap can be filled by reaction with deoxynucleoside
      triphosphates and DNA polymerase I. When this sequence of reactions is performed 
      with DNA containing a mismatch oligonucleotide primer in the (-)-strand
      mutational frequencies of 70-90% can be obtained upon transformation. The general
      nature of this methodology has been further shown to be applicable to other
      restriction enzymes such as Hind II, Pst I and Fsp I. The mutational frequency
      obtained using these enzymes is between 40-80% mainly because of less efficient
      nicking and gapping. Studies on inhibition of Nci I cleavage show that in
      addition to a phosphorothioate group at the position of cleavage an additional
      group in the 5'-neighbouring position is necessary for complete inhibition.

TI  - The ILV5 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is highly expressed.
PG  - 9631-51
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the yeast ILV5 gene, which codes for the
      branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis enzyme acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase, 
      has been determined. The ILV5 coding region is 1,185 nucleotides, corresponding
      to a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 44,280. Transcription of the ILV5
      mRNA initiates at position -81 upstream from the ATG translation start codon and 
      terminates between 218 and 222 bases downstream from the stop codon. Consensus
      sequences have been identified for initiation and termination of transcription,
      and for general control of amino acid biosynthesis, as well as repression by
      leucine. The ILV5 gene is regulated slightly by general amino acid control. Codon
      usage of the ILV5 gene has the strong bias observed in yeast genes that are
      highly expressed. In agreement with this, the reductoisomerase monomer, with an
      apparent molecular weight of 40,000, has been identified in an SDS polyacrylamide
      gel pattern of total soluble yeast proteins as a gene dosage dependent band.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the interaction between an enhancer binding factor and its 
      DNA target.
PG  - 9595-611
AB  - The fine contacts of a mouse nuclear factor, called PEB1, with the B enhancer of 
      polyoma virus were analyzed. It protects against DNaseI attack a region of about 
      50 base pairs that can be divided in two domains. The first contains a GC-rich
      palindrome and the homology to the SV40 enhancer. The second is homologous to a
      sequence in the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene enhancer. Methylation
      interference and protection experiments reveal strong specific contacts only with
      a purine rich track on the late coding strand of the early proximal part of the
      palindrome. Deletion analysis show that the minimal sequences necessary for
      binding include only the first domain. The Ig homology contributes only weakly to
      the binding. The minimal core is similar to the core of the B enhancer defined in
      vivo. The interactions we observe here are reminiscent of those of TFIIIA
      positive transcription factor and the 5SRNA gene of Xenopus.

TI  - Purification and properties of a single strand-specific endonuclease from mouse
      cell mitochondria.
PG  - 9579-93
AB  - A nuclease was purified from mitochondria of the mouse plasmacytoma cell line,
      MCP-11 which acts on single-stranded DNA endonucleolytically and appears to have 
      no activity upon native DNA. It degrades unordered RNA somewhat more effectively 
      than it does DNA. The enzyme activity and the major detectable polypeptide
      migrate to a position corresponding to an Mr of 37,400 on denaturing
      polyacrylamide gels; in its native form the activity has an S value of 4.7, which
      corresponds to a molecular weight of roughly 73,000. The single-strand DNase
      activity has a pH optimum near 7.5, requires a divalent cation and is inhibited
      by EDTA, phosphate, KCl and NaCl. The enzyme is remarkably similar to fungal
      mitochondrial enzymes whose absence in various mutants correlates with defective 
      DNA repair and recombination. It reacts weakly with antibody to a form of such an
      enzyme from Neurospora crassa.

TI  - Molecular cloning of a steroid-regulated 108K heat shock protein gene from hen
      oviduct.
PG  - 10053-69
AB  - The natural gene for a steroid inducible 108K heat shock protein has been
      isolated from a lambda genomic library prepared from hen oviduct tissue. Genomic 
      DNA blots indicate that it exists as a single copy gene in the chick oviduct
      haploid genome. The 9.9 kilobase gene codes for a messenger RNA of 2733bp (21)
      and is split into 18 exons as established by sequence comparison of cDNA and
      genomic clones. The 3' end of the gene contains a repetitive element which shares
      homology with the CR1 family of repeats. The first exon contains both the
      untranslated leader and coding regions of the gene. The promoter region is rich
      in G + C residues (70%) and the dinucleotide CG. This 5' flanking segment
      contains bases similar both in sequence and location to the Goldberg-Hogness TATA
      homology and consensus sequence CCAAT. A consensus sequence located upstream of
      steroid hormone responsive chicken genes is found at -267 and on a reverse
      orientation at -593. The structure of this gene is of interest since the presence
      of introns in heat shock genes is rare in any species examined to date.
      Furthermore, this gene lacks the previously described heat shock promoter
      consensus sequence (C-GAA-TTC-G) present in other species.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of Bacillus phage phi 29 genes 14 and 15: homology of gene 15
      with other phage lysozymes.
PG  - 10001-8
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of Bacillus phage phi 29 genes 14 (g14) and 15 (g15) have
      been determined and shown to encode proteins with molecular weights of 15,014 and
      28,022, respectively. The g14 open reading frame (ORF) was confirmed by
      sequencing a sus14(1241) mutant. Gene product 15 (gp15) has considerable homology
      with Salmonella phage P22 lysozyme and lesser homology with Escherichia coli
      phage T4 lysozyme. Putative translation signals are identified. In addition, the 
      role of a previously described promoter, B2, is discussed.

PG  - 2483-92
AB  - A crude fraction was isolated from pig heart left ventricle (150 g) homogenates
      after extraction of lipids, chromatographic separation and desalting. The extract
      contained an ionic content of 0.21, 0.27, 0.33 and 1.7 mM respectively for Mg2+, 
      Ca2+, K+, and Na+. The albumin extract, used as a reference control, contained an
      ionic content of 0.88 and 2.1 mM respectively for K+ and Na+ and negligible
      amounts of Mg2+ and Ca2+. The isolated fraction exhibited digitalis-like
      properties in the inhibition of sarcolemmal Na+, K+-ATPase in a dose dependent
      manner, the displacement of [3H]-ouabain binding from membrane receptor sites and
      produced +ve inotropic response in isolated perfused heart in a dose dependent
      manner. The albumin extract tested in the same manner showed no digitalis-like
      properties. The ventricular fraction was unable to displace (-) 3H-DHA binding
      from membrane sites and its inotropic action was not blocked by propranolol. The 
      data suggests that the fraction isolated from pig heart left ventricle contains a
      substance which has some properties like digitalis.

TI  - Anatomical localization of corticotropin-releasing activity in the human brain.
PG  - 2475-81
AB  - Corticotropin-releasing activity (CRa) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) content
      were measured in seven human hypothalami. The hypothalami were obtained from
      routine autopsy of patients suffering from no obvious neuroendocrinological
      abnormality. Twelve distinct hypothalamic areas were dissected in the frozen
      state and extracted in aqueous solution. CRa was measured by a bioassay measuring
      the aCTH released by rat pituitary cells in vitro, and vasopressin by direct
      radioimmunoassay. CRa was detectable in almost every area with the highest values
      in the supraoptic, paraventricular and infundibular (arcuate) areas. Vasopressin 
      concentrations were maximum in the supraoptic nucleus, followed by the
      paraventricular and infundibular nuclei. We conclude that: hypothalami obtained
      from routine autopsy at a general hospital can be used for consistent CRa and
      vasopressin assay. Vasopressin and CRa are similarly distributed in man and in
      the rat. In both species, high CRa, which is not explained by AVP, is found in
      the paraventricular nucleus. The infundibular (arcuate) nucleus seems to display 
      non AVP-dependent CRa much greater in the human than in the rat.

TI  - Measures of cooperativity in the binding of ligands to proteins and their
      relation to non-additivity in protein-protein interactions.
PG  - 315-29
AB  - The analogy between cooperativity in the binding of ligands to proteins and
      non-additivity in protein-protein interactions is demonstrated and discussed in
      terms of the Wong and the Hill coefficients. A measure of non-additivity, the
      interaction constant, is rigorously derived for four thermodynamic cycles,
      involving the binding of small molecules to proteins and protein association. It 
      is the reciprocal of the 'defect factor' of Laskowski et al. in Proteinase
      inhibitors: medical and biological aspects (ed. N. Katunuma et al.), pp. 55-68
      (1983), and its logarithm is the Wong measure of cooperativity. These three
      measures are thus here given a common theoretical basis. The Hill coefficient for
      an asymmetric dimer that binds two different ligands which do not compete for the
      same site, at 50% saturation of each site, is derived. It is shown to be a
      function of the interaction constant and of the fraction of protein to which
      ligand is bound at both sites. These relations for protein-ligand interactions
      are then discussed in the context of non-additivity in protein-protein
      interactions.

TI  - Factors responsible for a karyotypic polymorphism in the common shrew, Sorex
      araneus.
PG  - 277-98
AB  - A Robertsonian karyotypic polymorphism in the common shrew in the Oxford area,
      first described in the 1950s, was re-examined. The polymorphism involves
      chromosome arm combinations kq, no and pr (characteristic of the Oxford
      karyotypic race), ko (characteristic of the Hermitage karyotypic race) and jl
      (found in both races). The polymorphism for jl was sporadic along a north-south
      transect through the Oxford area, with the frequency of the twin-acrocentric
      morph never exceeding 10%. The frequency of the Oxford race-specific metacentrics
      decreased and the frequency of the Hermitage race-specific metacentric ko
      increased from north to south along the transect. At a latitudinal grid reference
      of about 180 km, there was a high frequency of individuals with chromosome arms
      k, n, o and q in the ancestral acrocentric state. This was coincident with the
      area of occurrence of ko-kq and ko-no Oxford-Hermitage hybrids. Such hybrids are 
      double Robertsonian heterozygotes with monobrachial homology and are likely to
      suffer reduced fertility in consequence. It is proposed that this is a source of 
      selection against the monobrachial hybrids and hence results in an increase in
      frequency of the acrocentric morphs. This scheme goes some way to explain the
      clines of polymorphism for arm combinations kq, no and ko, but it is suggested
      that other selective factors are involved. It cannot explain the cline of
      polymorphism for pr, which is in general terms similar to that for kq and no, but
      is more shallow and centred further north.

TI  - End-stopped cells and binocular depth discrimination in the striate cortex of
      cats.
PG  - 257-76
AB  - Proposals concerning neural mechanisms for binocular depth discrimination have
      been criticized on the grounds that only striate cells with a preferred stimulus 
      orientation not too far from the vertical can make significant horizontal
      disparity discriminations. We investigated this claim by preparing a
      two-dimensional array of position-disparity response profiles to moving light and
      dark bars from each of 18 cells in the simple family. From these arrays, it was
      possible to reconstruct disparity response profiles along any axis across the
      receptive field, irrespective of the cell's optimal stimulus orientation. This
      analysis showed that cells with a predominantly excitatory binocular response (N 
      = 10) can make precise horizontal disparity discriminations, independent of their
      optimal stimulus orientation, provided that they are sufficiently end stopped.
      End-free cells, on the other hand, are effective for horizontal disparity
      discriminations only if their preferred orientation are near the vertical. Nearly
      all striate cells we examined were end-stopped to some degree and nearly half had
      an end inhibition sufficient to reduce the monocular response from the dominant
      eye to half its maximal amplitude. Cells having a predominantly inhibitory
      disparity response profile of the symmetric type (N = 8) have an inhibitory
      profile along every axis across the receptive field. An outline is given of a
      neural mechanism for the determination of absolute viewing distance based on the 
      sensitivities of striate cells to vertical retinal-image disparities.

      moving light and dark bars.
PG  - 227-56
AB  - New knowledge concerning the internal structure and response properties of the
      receptive fields of striate cells calls for a fresh appraisal of their binocular 
      interactions in the interest of a better understanding of the neural mechanisms
      underlying binocular depth discrimination. Binocular position-disparity response 
      profiles were recorded from 71 simple and B-cells in response to moving light and
      dark bars. Predominantly excitatory (PE) cells (N = 48) had disparity response
      profiles that were spatially closely similar to their respective monocular
      responses. In addition, the centrally located excitatory subregions were flanked 
      on one or both sides by non-specific inhibitory regions. PE cells with a
      preferred stimulus orientation within 30 degrees of the vertical (N = 17) showed 
      binocular facilitations with maximal values that were always more than twice
      (mean 3.3) the sum of the two monocular responses to the same stimuli and
      generally greater than the facilitations shown by cells with orientations more
      than 30 degrees from the vertical (N = 29; mean 2.2 times the sum of the
      respective monocular responses). The strength of the binocular facilitation
      depended on the stimulus contrast, the facilitation decreasing with increasing
      contrast. The receptive-field disparity distribution of the 31 PE cells capable
      of making significant horizontal disparity discriminations has standard
      deviations of 0.37 degrees and 0.40 degrees, respectively. Predominantly
      inhibitory cells (PI) (N = 23) showed two basic types of disparity response
      profile: symmetric (N = 17) and asymmetric (N = 6). Uncertainty regarding the
      precise location of the binocular fixation point in the anaesthetized and
      paralysed preparation made it difficult to categorize PI cells adequately.

TI  - Linkage of tyrosine hydroxylase to four other markers on the short arm of
      chromosome 11.
PG  - 9927-32
AB  - Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis; the 
      gene has previously been cloned and localised to the short arm of chromosome 11. 
      Because of the interest in tyrosine hydroxylase as a candidate gene for
      manic-depressive psychosis and other affective disorders, we carried out family
      studies to determine the linkage of tyrosine hydroxylase with insulin,
      beta-globin, D11S12 and Harvey-ras 1, members of a linkage group which has
      previously been localised to 11p. Using DNA from the Centre d'Etude du
      Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) and from two large British pedigrees, we show that
      tyrosine hydroxylase is closely linked to these four loci (z = 7.36, theta = 0.04
      for linkage to insulin) and suggest a gene order based on multipoint mapping.

TI  - The maintenance of methylation-free islands in transgenic mice.
PG  - 9667-78
AB  - The Thy-1 gene is expressed in a tissue- and stage-specific pattern and has a
      typical 1.6kb methylation-free island (MFI) covering about 600bp upstream and
      downstream of the two alternative first exons. By microinjection of a mouse
      Thy-1.1/human Thy-1 gene into fertilized eggs, we were able to show that the MFI 
      is restored in the transgenic mice. The flanking sequence became methylated, but 
      the MFI remains unmethylated in all tissues of transgenic mice at different
      developmental stages tested, irrespective of the site of expression of the gene. 
      There is one exception, in extra-embryonal tissues of 14.5 day embryos a small
      percentage of the islands were methylated. We conclude that maintenance of the
      MFI is regulated by cis-acting sequences present within the gene, and indicates
      that the unmethylated state of the islands is consistent with a necessary but not
      sufficient condition for expression of the gene.

TI  - Role of a long-acting somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995) in the treatment of
      acromegaly.
PG  - 94-101
AB  - The beneficial effect of the long-acting analogue of somatostatin SMS 201-995 in 
      the treatment of acromegaly is described in three cases, and current published
      experience is reviewed. A total of 64 patients from 10 series have received the
      drug from one to 25 months, usually in doses of 50-150 micrograms every eight
      hours by subcutaneous injection. Clinical and chemical improvement was observed
      in the majority of subjects but normal 24-hour serum growth hormone levels were
      achieved in no more than 35 percent of this group and possibly less. We have
      found that higher doses, up to 1,500 micrograms per day, which have generally
      been free of side effects, are sometimes required to normalize growth hormone
      secretion. A reduction of up to 33 percent in pituitary tumor size has been
      reported in more than half of the 27 cases studied from four groups. Clinically
      important side effects are infrequent, but diarrhea, usually transient, occurred 
      in about 13 percent, with frank steatorrhea in 2 to 6 percent of cases.
      Alteration in carbohydrate metabolism, such as transient glucose intolerance at
      the start of therapy in non-diabetic acromegalic patients, and increased
      sensitivity to insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetic acromegalic
      patients, is common. Overall, SMS 201-995 appears to be a valuable new agent for 
      the treatment of acromegaly, but long-term safety needs to be established.

PG  - 88-93
AB  - The hormonal and metabolic effects of the somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 have 
      been examined in normal and diabetic humans. When 50 micrograms of analogue was
      administered subcutaneously at 8 A.M. and 5:30 P.M., growth hormone secretion
      over 24 hours was not significantly affected, and the nocturnal growth hormone
      surge persisted in normal subjects and in type II diabetic patients. Insulin
      secretion was suppressed in both groups, but glucose tolerance deteriorated only 
      in the normal subjects. Gastrointestinal side effects developed in both groups.
      Subcutaneous administration of 50 micrograms of SMS 201-995 at 11 P.M. decreased 
      nocturnal growth hormone secretion (peak, 5 +/- 2 milliunits/liter versus 23 +/- 
      6 milliunits/liter; p less than 0.01) in normal subjects. Postprandial
      circulating glucose and insulin levels the following day were unaffected by SMS
      201-995, and no side effects were observed. In type I diabetic patients receiving
      a variable rate insulin infusion overnight to maintain normoglycemia, SMS 201-995
      (50 micrograms) administered at 11 P.M. decreased insulin requirements for two to
      three hours after injection. Insulin sensitivity thereafter was unaffected
      despite suppression of growth hormone secretion. Alternative dosage regimens are 
      necessary to suppress growth hormone release over 24 hours and to minimize side
      effects in type II diabetes. Administration of the analogue in the late evening
      suppresses growth hormone secretion overnight, but the "dawn phenomenon" persists
      in type I diabetic patients.

PG  - 83-7
AB  - A somatostatin analogue, compound SMS 201-995, was used to treat postprandial
      hypotension in a patient with autonomic neuropathy. Prior to treatment, the
      patient's mean blood pressure decreased 50 to 80 mm Hg after each meal, resulting
      in frequent loss of consciousness. Subcutaneous administration of low doses of
      compound SMS 201-995 (12 to 16 micrograms) prevented the postprandial
      hypotension. The therapeutic benefits of SMS 201-995 dissipated after a few
      hours, however, which made it necessary to administer the drug with each meal. No
      adverse effects of this agent were noted over a nine-month treatment period.
      Compound SMS 201-995 provided safe and effective therapy for postprandial

TI  - Comparison of the effect of somatostatin and an analogue, SMS 201-995, on gastrin
      and insulin secretion from isolated perfused rat stomach and pancreas.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - The effects of a somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995, and somatostatin-14 on
      gastrin and insulin release from the isolated perfused rat stomach and pancreas
      were studied. Equipotent effects were observed on the inhibition of basal gastrin
      release from the stomach. SMS 201-995 was approximately 14 times less effective
      than somatostatin-14 (molar basis) in the pancreas. At a high glucose
      concentration (17.6 mM), neither the analogue nor the peptide inhibited insulin
      release, but at a glucose concentration of 8.8 mM, there was significant
      inhibition. In the presence of 10 mM arginine plus glucose at a concentration of 
      either 8.8 or 17.6 mM, insulin secretion was reduced by both SMS 201-995 and
      somatostatin-14 to levels obtained with glucose alone. However, when gastric
      inhibitory polypeptide (10 ng/ml) in the presence of 8.8 mM glucose was used to
      stimulate insulin release, somatostatin-14 completely inhibited the
      insulinotropic action of gastric inhibitory polypeptide while SMS 201-995 was
      without effect. Studies with this analogue suggest that arginine and gastric
      inhibitory polypeptide stimulate insulin release via different mechanisms.

TI  - Characterization of the in vivo and in vitro inhibition of gastrin secretion from
      gastrinoma by a somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995).
PG  - 56-64
AB  - Earlier experiments characterized the effect of SMS 201-995 on gastrin secretion 
      from gastrinoma in vivo. The results showed that the somatostatin analogue
      inhibits basal as well as secretin- and calcium-stimulated gastrin secretion. The
      current study examined the effect of SMS 201-995 on gastrin secretion from
      gastrinoma in vitro. Gastrinoma cells were prepared in cell culture or acute cell
      dispersion to study basal gastrin release. In cell culture, SMS 201-995 at 10(-9)
      M, 10(-8) M, and 10(-7) M significantly stimulated gastrin secretion (basal
      medium gastrin, 157 +/- 7.9 pg/ml; with SMS 201-995 10(-9) M, 786 +/- 62 pg/ml;
      with SMS 201-995 10(-8) M, 569 +/- 72 pg/ml; and with SMS 201-995 10(-7) M, 258
      +/- 26 pg/ml). In contrast, in acute cell dispersion, the somatostatin analogue
      inhibited gastrin secretion (basal medium gastrin, 12.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml; with SMS
      201-995 10(-9) M, 9.0 +/- 0.1 ng/ml; with SMS 201-995 10(-8) M, 8.4 +/- 1.5
      ng/ml; and with SMS 201-995 10(-7) M, 7.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml). Gastrinoma cells were
      prepared in cell culture to study the effect of SMS 201-995 on gastrin secretion 
      stimulated by secretin and by post-receptor increases in adenosine cyclic
      nucleotide. The somatostatin analogue inhibited gastrin secretion stimulated by
      secretin (10(-6) M) (797 +/- 48 pg/ml for secretin alone, compared with 396 +/-
      9.4 pg/ml for secretin plus SMS 201-995). SMS 201-995 did not inhibit gastrin
      secretion stimulated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-7) M) (617 +/- 62 pg/ml for
      dibutyryl cyclic AMP alone, compared with 778 +/- 55 pg/ml for the two together).
      In vitro, SMS 201-995 inhibits basal gastrin secretion from gastrinoma prepared
      in acute cell dispersion, but not gastrinoma in cell culture, probably due to
      differences in basal secretory rates. The effect in vitro is less than that in
      vivo. SMS 201-995 does not inhibit postreceptor increases in adenosine
      nucleotide. This indirectly supports the hypothesis that SMS 201-995 acts in
      gastrinoma cells to inhibit gastrin secretion by inhibition of adenylate cyclase 
      activity.

TI  - Somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995) in the management of gastroenteropancreatic
      tumors and diarrhea syndromes.
PG  - 23-40
AB  - SMS 201-995 (Sandostatin) was studied using low doses (50 to 100 micrograms)
      administered subcutaneously every 12 hours. A single 50-micrograms dose of SMS
      201-995 effectively controlled gastric acid and blood gastrin levels for 12 hours
      in three patients with benign gastrinomas and was useful in their perioperative
      management. Higher doses of the agent (500 to 800 micrograms per day) had no
      effect on metastases in one of two patients with metastatic gastrinoma. In the
      other patient, one tumor shrank but the other continued to grow after three
      months of treatment while serum gastrin levels did not change. Cultured
      metastatic tumor tissue from this patient released different forms of gastrin;
      growth rates varied, independent of uptake of SMS 201-995, and gastrin release
      increased. A neonate with nesidioblastosis maintained normal blood glucose levels
      while receiving SMS 201-995 therapy following a 95 percent pancreatic resection. 
      In two elderly patients with organic hypoglycemia--one with a single benign
      adenoma and one with multiple adenomatosis--the somatostatin analogue did not
      prolong the hypoglycemia-free interval. In nine patients with carcinoid syndrome,
      flushing was uniformly controlled with 50 micrograms of SMS 201-995 administered 
      every eight to 12 hours. One of the nine required exocrine pancreatic
      replacement. After six months of treatment, three of the nine had no change in
      tumor size and one had remission of symptoms and stopped treatment. In two
      patients with vipoma, SMS 201-995 controlled diarrhea and reduced levels of
      vasoactive intestinal peptide; tumor necrosis occurred in one patient. In a
      patient with diabetic diarrhea unresponsive to all treatments, SMS 201-995
      therapy controlled the diarrhea but did not interfere with control of the
      diabetes.

PG  - 14-22
AB  - A center in Belfast, Northern Ireland, has established a register for tumors of
      the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system. Carcinoid tumors occur most
      frequently. Of the non-carcinoid tumors, insulinomas, gastrinomas, and unknown
      types have the highest incidence, with other types being extremely rare. The
      potentially remediable nature of the tumors is stressed, and frequently a good
      quality of life can be experienced even in the presence of metastatic disease.
      The syndromes are probably underdiagnosed as they present with clinical features 
      for which there are more common explanations, and appropriate diagnostic methods 
      are therefore not used. The management of the syndromes is reviewed with
      particular emphasis on the treatment of patients with inoperable disease.
      Histamine (H2)-receptor antagonist therapy has made an impact in
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and streptozotocin and somatostatin analogues can
      control tumor growth and endocrine syndromes, respectively.

      anticonflict effects similar to diazepam.
PG  - 2455-61
AB  - The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, AP7, was evaluated in two
      animal test procedures known to be sensitive to the effects of diazepam. In rats 
      trained to discriminate diazepam from vehicle, AP7 produced dose-dependent
      generalization to the diazepam interoceptive stimuli. This NMDA antagonist also
      increased the rates of conflict responding in a chronic test procedure used to
      identify compounds with potential anxiolytic effects. A comparison of AP7 with
      diazepam and two muscle relaxants (methocarbamol and baclofen) showed that
      excitatory amino acid antagonists (of the receptor site stimulated by NMDA)
      produce a muscle relaxant effect (drug discrimination) and may represent a new
      class of compounds for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders (conflict
      test).

PG  - 2441-6
AB  - LY165163, a ligand reported to be selective for the 5HT1A subtype of serotonin
      receptor, was examined for its ability to interact with 5HT2 receptors in the rat
      jugular vein and alpha-receptors in the rat aorta. In these smooth muscle
      preparations, no agonist activity of LY165163 occurred in concentrations up to
      10(-5) M. However, LY165163 was an antagonist of serotonin-induced contractions
      in the jugular vein and of norepinephrine-induced contractions in the rat aorta. 
      The dissociation constant calculated for LY165163 at 5HT2 receptors in the rat
      jugular vein was 10(-8) M and at alpha-receptors in the rat aorta was 2 X 10(-7) 
      M. Thus, LY165163 is a relatively potent antagonist at vascular 5HT2 sites and
      possesses appreciable affinity at alpha-receptors. Based on these data, the
      multiple receptor interactions of LY165163 must be taken into consideration when 
      utilizing this agent as a probe for the 5HT1A subtype of serotonin receptor.

TI  - The potassium current activated by 2-nicotinamidoethyl nitrate (nicorandil) in
      single ventricular cells of guinea pigs.
PG  - 331-43
AB  - Membrane currents through potassium channels activated by nicorandil, which has a
      potent coronary vasodilating action, have been studied in ventricular cells of
      guinea pigs by using the single pipette whole-cell clamp technique. In the
      presence of 0.1 mM nicorandil, the duration of the action potential was shortened
      from 196 to 145 ms. Nicorandil markedly increased outward currents at potentials 
      positive to the resting potential. When the difference in the currents before and
      after the application of nicorandil were plotted against the membrane potential, 
      the current-voltage relation reversed close to the potassium equilibrium
      potential. The difference current during depolarizing pulses showed no
      time-dependent relaxation. These results indicate that the current evoked by
      nicorandil is carried by K+ ions and has voltage-independent kinetics.
      Power-density spectra obtained in the presence of nicorandil were fitted well by 
      a single Lorentzian curve with a corner frequency of 4.4 Hz. The amplitude of the
      single-channel unit current was estimated from the relation between the variance 
      and the mean current, and was 0.27 +/- 0.1 pA (n = 7) at -35 mV. The estimated
      slope conductance was 4.6 +/- 1.7 pS. Nicorandil did not affect Ca2+ currents. It
      is concluded that nicorandil activates a small-conductance K+ channel without
      affecting the Ca2+ channel.

TI  - Specific substance P binding sites in rat thymus and spleen: in vitro
      autoradiographic study.
PG  - 147-56
AB  - Substance P binding sites were localized in rat thymus and spleen by incubation
      of tissue sections with [125I]Bolton-Hunter substance P, [3H]Ultrofilm
      autoradiography with image analysis coupled to computerized microdensitometry and
      comparison with 125I standards. The tissue localization of the binding sites was 
      determined with emulsion autoradiography. A single type of specific, saturable,
      high affinity binding sites was found associated with the vasculature in the
      medulla of the thymus and the marginal sinus of the spleen, with a Kd of 0.10 and
      0.14 nM, respectively. Of all the unlabeled tachykinins tested (substance P,
      physalaemin, substance K, eledoisin, kassinin, and neuromedin K) substance P was 
      the most potent inhibitor of [125I]Bolton-Hunter substance P binding, with an
      IC50 of approximately 0.5 nM, indicating the presence of substance P-P binding
      sites. Our results support the hypothesis of a role for substance P in the
      modulation of the immune system.

TI  - Calcitonin gene-related peptide in the eye: release by sensory nerve stimulation 
      and effects associated with neurogenic inflammation.
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the anterior uvea coexists with
      tachykinins (substance P and neurokinin A) in sensory nerve fibers deriving from 
      the trigeminal ganglion. Mechanical or electrical stimulation of the intracranial
      part of the trigeminal nerve/ganglion in rabbits produced a marked hyperemia in
      the anterior segment of the eye, increased intraocular pressure, breakdown of the
      blood-aqueous barrier and miosis. Simultaneously, CGRP-like immunoreactivity was 
      released into the aqueous humor. This suggests that the highly vasoactive CGRP
      can be released from sensory nerve fibers to participate in vascular responses.
      Unlike the tachykinins, CGRP per se was without effect on the pupillary diameter 
      while disrupting the blood-aqueous barrier (resulting in aqueous flare) upon
      intravitreal injection. In addition, CGRP enhanced the aqueous flare evoked by a 
      minimal eye trauma (infrared irradiation of the iris). The miosis evoked by the
      intravitreal injection of substance P was more pronounced when CGRP was injected 
      simultaneously, and finally, substance P induced aqueous flare much more
      effectively when given together with a threshold dose of CGRP.

TI  - DNase I hypersensitivity and methylation of the 5'-flanking region of the alpha
      1-fetoprotein gene during developmental and glucocorticoid-induced repression of 
      its activity in rat liver.
PG  - 9827-41
AB  - Three major regions of DNase I hypersensitivity (DH) were found in alpha
      1-fetoprotein (AFP) chromatin of rat liver. DH site I is located at the
      transcription initiation site and associated with ongoing AFP transcription. DH
      site II is located 2.5 kb upstream from the cap site: it is developmental
      stage-dependent but dissociable from ongoing AFP transcription. DH site III, 3.7 
      kb upstream from the cap site, behaves as hepatocyte-constitutive. DH sites are
      present in similar regions of liver albumin chromatin. Dexamethasone-induced AFP 
      gene repression is accompanied by the selective loss of AFP DH site I, a likely
      result of glucocorticoid receptors binding to a DNA recognition sequence located 
      5'-adjacent to DH site I. Sl nuclease-hypersensitive sites were found on naked
      superhelical AFP and albumin DNA, but do not appear to contribute DH sites in
      liver chromatin. The extent of hypomethylation of HpaII sites at the 5'-end of
      the AFP gene correlates positively with the level of potential and actual
      expression of the gene. We conclude that developmental and hormonal regulation of
      the AFP gene is confined within congruent to 4 kb of 5'-flanking DNA, and we
      discuss possible hierarchical interactions among DH sites, in relation to DNA
      methylation and replication.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence and newly formed phosphodiester bond of spontaneously ligated
      satellite tobacco ringspot virus RNA.
PG  - 9729-43
AB  - The satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (STobRV RNA) replicates and becomes
      encapsidated in association with tobacco ringspot virus. Previous results show
      that the infected tissue produces multimeric STobRV RNAs of both polarities. RNA 
      that is complementary to encapsidated STobRV RNA, designated as having the (-)
      polarity, cleaves autolytically at a specific ApG bond. Purified autolysis
      products spontaneously join in a non-enzymic reaction. We report characteristics 
      of this RNA ligation reaction: the terminal groups that react, the type of bond
      in the newly formed junction and the nucleotide sequence of the joined RNA. The
      nucleotide sequence of the ligated RNA shows that joining of the reacting RNAs
      restored an ApG bond. The junction ApG has a 3'-to-5' phosphodiester bond. Thus
      the net ligation reaction of STobRV (-)RNA is the precise reversal of autolysis. 
      We discuss this new type of RNA ligation reaction and its implications for the
      formation of multimeric STobRV RNAs during replication.

TI  - CD of homopolymer DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes and triplexes containing A-T or A-U

PG  - 10071-90
AB  - CD spectra and difference-CD spectra of (a) two DNA X RNA hybrid duplexes
      (poly[r(A) X d(U)] and poly[r(A) X d(T)]) and (b) three hybrid triplexes
      (poly-[d(T) X r(A) X d(T)], poly[r(U) X d(A) X r(U)], and poly[r(T) X d(A) X
      r(T)]) were obtained and compared with CD spectra of six A X U- and A X
      T-containing duplex and triplex RNAs and DNAs. We found that the CD spectra of
      the homopolymer duplexes above 260 nm were correlated with the type of base pair 
      present (A-U or A-T) and could be interpreted as the sum of the CD contributions 
      of the single strands plus a contribution due to base pairing. The spectra of the
      duplexes below 235 nm were related to the polypurine strands present (poly-[r(A)]
      or poly[d(A)]). We interpret the CD intensity in the intermediate 255-235 nm
      region of these spectra to be mainly due to stacking of the constituent
      polypurine strands. Three of the five hybrids (poly[r(A) X d(U)], poly[r(A) X
      d(T)], and poly[d(T) X r(A) X d(T)]) were found to have heteronomous
      conformations, while poly[r(U) X d(A) X r(U)] was found to be the most A-like and
      poly[r(T) X d(A) X r(T)], the least A-like.

TI  - Selective enrichment of specific DNA, cDNA and RNA sequences using biotinylated

PG  - 10027-44
AB  - We have developed a general procedure for the rapid and efficient enrichment of
      specific DNA, RNA or cDNA sequences. Biotinylated DNA or RNA is used as a
      hybridization probe in solution, avidin is then added to label both the probe and
      hybrid molecules, and the hybridization mixture chromatographed over
      cupric-iminodiacetic acid agarose beads. Avidin-probe and avidin-hybrid molecules
      are selectively retained on the column; non-hybridized sequences are contained in
      the flow-through fraction. Sequences retained on the column are recovered in high
      yield by the addition of ethylenediamine tetracetic acid in the buffer. The
      method can be used in both subtractive enrichment and positive selection
      protocols. Here we report its application to the isolation of Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae specific genomic DNA clones and the purification of a cDNA
      subpopulation representing mRNA sequences that are over-expressed in murine
      Friend cells after dimethylsulfoxide induction.

TI  - Neuropeptides and gastrointestinal immunity.
PG  - 74-82
AB  - Several peptides originally described as neurotransmitters or gut hormones have
      recently been shown to modulate the immune response. Three of these peptides,
      vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, and somatostatin, regulate the
      function of immune effector cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Vasoactive
      intestinal peptide modulates lymphocyte migration and natural killer cell
      activity by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent mechanism, whereas 
      substance P induces mediator release by a cAMP-independent mechanism.
      Somatostatin antagonizes the effects of both vasoactive intestinal peptide and
      substance P by a mechanism that appears to involve inhibitory guanine nucleotide 
      binding proteins. Neuropeptide regulation of immune cells in gut-associated
      lymphoid tissue may thus play an important role in gastrointestinal physiology.

TI  - Metastatic carcinoid tumors and the carcinoid syndrome. A selective review of
      chemotherapy and hormonal therapy.
PG  - 49-55
AB  - Malignant carcinoid tumors are remarkably varied in their biologic behavior. The 
      disease may be indolent for years with minimal or no symptoms. On the other hand,
      an acute carcinoid crisis with severe diarrhea, dehydration, and hypotension may 
      develop in the patient. Patients with flushing and/or diarrhea, not responsive to
      standard symptomatic measures, may benefit from chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.
      Chemotherapy with single agents or combination chemotherapy may be associated
      with response rates ranging from 20 to 40 percent. Hepatic de-arterialization by 
      ligation or occlusion is an effective means of inducing rapid tumor shrinkage for
      patients who have carcinoid tumors and hepatic dominant metastases. The addition 
      of chemotherapy after induction of a partial remission with hepatic
      de-arterialization may prolong the duration of response, but this remains to be
      proven in prospective clinical trials. Hormonal therapy with the antiestrogen
      tamoxifen has been unsuccessful, but treatment of the carcinoid syndrome with a
      long-acting analogue of somatostatin has been strikingly effective.

TI  - Role of neuropeptides and serotonin in the diagnosis of carcinoid tumors.
PG  - 41-8
AB  - The plasma concentrations of neuropeptides (neurotensin, substance P, motilin,
      somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide and gastrin-releasing peptide), the
      urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and serotonin, and the platelet
      concentration of serotonin were compared in 133 patients who could be assigned to
      one of four groups. These groups were as follows: carcinoid tumors present;
      history of carcinoid tumors; miscellaneous tumors present; and non-tumor
      diseases. The test with the most sensitivity (i.e., patients with carcinoid
      tumors labeled positive) and the test with the most specificity (i.e., patients
      without carcinoid tumors labeled negative) for the presence of carcinoid tumors
      was determined. Urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion had a sensitivity of
      73 percent and a specificity of 100 percent; the plasma concentration of
      substance P had a sensitivity of 32 percent and a specificity of 85 percent; and 
      the plasma concentration of neurotensin had a sensitivity of 41 percent and a
      specificity of 60 percent. Even when basal plasma concentrations of substance P
      and neurotensin were elevated, there was no additional increase of these
      neuropeptides prior to ethanol-induced facial flushing. Although measurements of 
      plasma neuropeptide levels may be helpful in occasional patients with carcinoid
      tumors, it is concluded that measurements of serotonin overproduction--such as
      5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion--are of more general value.

TI  - Photoaffinity labelling of a 33-35,000 dalton protein in cardiac, skeletal and
      smooth muscle membranes using a new 125I-labelled 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium
      channel antagonist.
PG  - 2401-9
AB  - The binding sites for Ca2+ channel antagonists were probed using Bay P 8857
      [2-iodoethyl isopropyl
      1,4-dihydropyridine-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-pyridine-3,5-dicarbox ylate]
      that has been radiolabelled with 125I. This drug was shown to bind with high
      affinity to cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle membranes, with a KD
      approximately equal to 0.3 nM. A protein of molecular weight 33-35,000 daltons
      was specifically and irreversibly radiolabelled after irradiation of cardiac,
      skeletal and aortic smooth muscle membranes, incubated with the [125I]-Bay P
      8857. The peptide labelled by 1,4-dihydropyridine binding therefore appears
      similar in size for cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. This data suggests that
      of the three peptide subunits which reportedly comprise the skeletal and cardiac 
      muscle 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor complex, the 33-35,000 dalton peptide
      contains the dihydropyridine binding site.

TI  - Catalytic efficiency, kinetic co-operativity of oligomeric enzymes and evolution.
PG  - 431-51
AB  - The catalytic performance of an enzyme, whether it is monomeric or oligomeric,
      depends on extra costs of energy in passing from the initial ground state to the 
      various transition states, along the reaction co-ordinate. The improvement,
      during evolution, of the catalytic performance of individual subunits implies
      that three structural requirements are met in the course of an enzyme reaction:
      the unstrained enzyme subunits exist in the ground states under two
      conformations, one corresponding to the non-liganded state and the other to the
      liganded state; the inter-subunit strain is relieved in the various transition
      states; the subunits bound to the various transition states S not equal to, X not
      equal to and P not equal to have the same conformation. These structural
      requirements are precisely those which have been used to derive structural rate
      equations for polymeric enzymes. When subunits are loosely coupled, their
      arrangement controls the various rate constants, but not the extra costs of
      energy required to reach the various transition states. Moreover, one cannot
      expect the rate curve to display any sigmoidicity under these conditions. If
      subunits are tightly coupled and if the strained non-liganded and half-liganded
      states are destabilized with respect to the corresponding unstrained states, that
      is if they contain more conformational energy, the oligomeric enzyme is more
      catalytically efficient than the ideally isolated subunits. Moreover, if the
      available conformational energy of the half-liganded state is more than twice
      that of the non-liganded state, kinetic co-operativity is positive and the rate
      curve is sigmoidal. It is therefore the extent of inter-subunit strain in the
      half-liganded state which controls the appearance of sigmoidal kinetic behaviour.
      If subunits are tightly coupled but if inter-subunit strain is relieved in both
      the non-liganded and fully-liganded states, the half-liganded state controls both
      the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and the sigmoidicity of the rate curve.
      Sigmoidicity and high catalytic efficiency are to be observed when this
      half-liganded state is destabilized relative to the corresponding unstrained
      state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Design of experiments for the precise estimation of dose-response parameters: the
      Hill equation.
PG  - 415-30
AB  - Optimal experimental designs were evaluated for the precise estimation of
      parameters of the Hill model. The optimally effective designs were obtained by
      using the criterion of D-optimization. For the Hill model, optimal designs
      replicate 3 sampling points. These points were shown to be quite sensitive to the
      behavior of the experimental error. Since an investigator is often uncertain
      about error conditions in biological studies, a practical approach would use the 
      sampling scheme calculated for an intermediate error condition. Thus, if the
      behavior of error variances is not known, precise parameters of the Hill model
      are obtained by choosing concentrations which yield fractional responses
      (responses divided by their asymptotic, maximum value) of 0.086, 0.581 and 1.0.
      When experimental constraints limit the maximum attainable concentration and
      response, all design points are lowered. Appropriate designs can be constructed
      based on the design which is optimal when constraints result in a maximum
      attainable fractional response of 0.5. The optimal designs were found to be
      robust when the parameter values assumed by the investigator did not equal their 
      true values. The estimating efficiencies obtained by using two frequently applied
      designs were assessed. Uniformly spaced concentrations yielded imprecise
      parameters. Six-point, geometrically spaced designs gave generally good results. 
      However, their estimating efficiency was generally exceeded by the recommended
      sampling schemes even in the presence of uncertainty about error conditions. The 
      method exemplified in this paper can be used for other models.

TI  - Analysis of the physiological control of replication of ColE1-type plasmids.
PG  - 453-70
AB  - The physiology of ColE1-type plasmid replication in a growing host has been
      examined both theoretically, using computer simulation, and experimentally, by
      observing replication of the plasmid pBR322 after a nutritional shift-up from
      glycerol minimal medium (doubling time 71 min) to LB medium (doubling time 24
      min). The theory was based on a negative control model and uses three rate
      equations: for the accumulation of cell mass, for the accumulation of the
      replication inhibitor, and for the rate of plasmid synthesis. The implications of
      the theory were explored by simulating the effects of changes in the expression
      of replication control genes. The nutritional shift-up experiment showed that
      plasmid replication was blocked immediately after the shift for about half a mass
      doubling time; after that time, replication rapidly increased until plasmid
      numbers per unit volume of culture parallelled the increase in culture mass.
      After the establishment of steady-state growth in the post-shift medium, the
      plasmid concentration (plasmids per cell mass) was reduced in comparison to
      pre-shift growth in the same proportion as the culture doubling time. The results
      showed that plasmid replication factors are under metabolic control and that the 
      changes in the control of these factors compensate one another during
      steady-state growth, but not immediately after the medium shift.

TI  - Membrane potentials and sodium channels: hypotheses for growth regulation and
      cancer formation based on changes in sodium channels and gap junctions.
PG  - 377-401
AB  - Based on several convergent lines of investigation, we make two hypotheses which 
      are sufficient to explain many phenomena of growth regulation in both normal and 
      cancer cells. 1. The first hypothesis is that there is a boundary or threshold of
      resting cell membrane potential that separates normal resting cells from normal
      proliferating cells and cancer cells. The basis for this in existing literature
      values of membrane potentials in resting and proliferating cells is established. 
      A discussion of how these differences in potential can be explained focuses on
      changes in sodium permeability and internal sodium concentration. Of many sodium 
      transfer mechanisms, the sodium channel is emphasized and how increased
      intracellular transfer may stimulate DNA synthesis. The effects of changing cell 
      junctions, in particular gap junctions, on membrane potentials is also discussed,
      as well as the indications of altered junctions in tumor cells. The linking
      factor of the effects of growth factors on both cell junctions and sodium
      permeability leads to the second hypothesis. 2. Since growth initiation and
      inhibition involve sodium channels and gap junctions, several phenomena can be
      explained by postulating that they are one and the same entity. The basis for
      this hypothesis in existing descriptions of functional and structural
      similarities is outlined. The possible interchange of these elements in the cell 
      cycle lead to several corollaries consequent to the conservation of their total
      number. The formation of gap junctions would consume sodium channels, decrease
      sodium permeability and stop DNA synthesis. Conversely, growth factors may
      competitively bind to channel-connexon elements, cleave gap junctions, liberate
      sodium channels to increase sodium permeability, and trigger DNA synthesis.
      Alterations in the structure of gap junction-channel elements in tumor cells
      would be sufficient to explain some carcinogenesis.

AB  - In 1951 a well known otolaryngologist recorded 798 brass nameplates in a well
      known London street. In the 35 years since this last survey was conducted the
      number has decreased by 23. This surprising finding is attributed to the communal
      entryphone and to the emergence of the shoddy plate. A definition of a plate is
      proposed, the concentration described, and the geographical distribution of
      plates summarised. A new phenomenon is encountered, the ghost plate, type A and
      type B. Further study is required to elucidate the significance of ghost plates.

      Archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.
PG  - 3715-21
AB  - DNA-protein complexes formed in vitro with isolated DNA-binding proteins from the
      thermoacidophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius were analyzed by
      electron microscopy. Two of the proteins (10a and 10b) formed specific structures
      after incubation with DNA. Protein 10a, at low protein concentrations, showed
      individual small spots on the DNA and at high concentrations evenly covered
      doublestranded DNA. Protein 10b showed three different types of regular
      structures: one with single-stranded and two with double-stranded DNA. Using
      double-stranded DNA, 10b first bound cooperatively to two strands forming long,
      plait-like structures only slightly shorter than respective free DNA. The complex
      consists of two right-handed, interwound fibers, with a helical pitch of 26 nm
      and a diameter of approximately 10-11 nm. At higher protein concentration than
      needed to package all DNA into the complex with two double-stranded DNAs, the two
      DNAs were separated again and a new structure was formed evenly covering only one
      DNA strand. Both structures showed no significant contraction of the length of
      the DNA covered in the complex. Nucleoprotein formed with single-stranded PhiX174
      DNA had a diameter of approximately 11 nm and could form circles with a contour
      length of 0.5 mum.

TI  - The structure of hobo transposable elements and their insertion sites.
PG  - 3615-23
AB  - The hobo transposable elements of Drosophila form a family of 3.0-kb elements and
      their deletion derivatives. Their distribution is consistent with the model that 
      3.0-kb elements are functionally complete but that smaller hobos are defective
      and require complete elements in trans for transposition. The sequence of one
      3.0-kb element is presented; it has several interesting features, including a
      1.9-kb open reading frame downstream from potential TATA and CAT sequences.
      Comparison of 11 independent insertion sites shows that in every case the hobo
      element has integrated at and duplicated either the sequence NNNNNNAC or
      CTTTNNNN. There is evidence that an eight nucleotide sequence internal to hobo
      that matches both of these sequences has been used as an insertion site for a
      second hobo element, as the first step in the creation of an internal deletion
      derivative. Structural similarities between hobo and the eukaryotic transposable 
      elements P, Ac, 1723, and Tam3, found in widely divergent host organisms, suggest
      that they all transpose by a common mechanism.

TI  - The regulation of male-specific transcripts by sex determining genes in
      Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 3579-82
AB  - The accumulation of male-specific transcripts in various genotypes of Drosophila 
      melanogaster was analysed by Northern blot hybridization. The genotypes were
      either hetero- or homozygous for a mutation in one of the genes for somatic sex
      determination. The aim was to study the role of these genes in regulating
      male-specific transcription in soma or germ line. All intersexual phenotypes and 
      pseudomales irrespective of their genotypic sex accumulate the male-specific
      somatic RNA demonstrating that it is regulated by these genes. In contrast to
      this, the transcript from the male germ line could only be detected in those
      mutant genotypes that have the male sex chromosome constitution of X/Y, although 
      its synthesis is not dependent on the presence of a Y chromosome. It is,
      therefore, not under the control of the sex determining loci but directly
      regulated by the primary signal for sex determination, namely the ratio of X
      chromosomes to autosomes.

TI  - Nerve growth factor activates Thy-1 and neurofilament gene transcription in rat
      PC12 cells.
PG  - 3449-53
AB  - The effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) on the expression of neurofilament and
      Thy-1 genes in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells was examined at both the
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Addition of NGF to cultured PC12
      cells produced increases in mRNAs corresponding to the 68 kd neurofilament
      protein (NF68) and the Thy-1 glycoprotein within 24 h, with maximal effects of
      some 90- and 45-fold stimulation (relative to beta-actin mRNA) being observed
      after 12 and 4 days of treatment, respectively. In addition, transcriptional
      run-off analyses using isolated nuclei showed that NGF treatment resulted
      directly in 8- and 4-fold increases in the rate of NF68 and Thy-1 gene
      transcription. These gene activation events were independent of overt
      morphological differentiation of PC12 cells occurring both under conditions
      permissive and non-permissive for neurite outgrowth, and once established the new
      molecular phenotype was dependent upon the continued presence of NGF. This is the
      first molecular evidence for the reversible activation of neuron-specific genes
      during NGF-induced differentiation in PC12 cells.

TI  - Caffeine and heat shock induce adenylate cyclase in Dictyostelium discoideum.
PG  - 3437-40
AB  - When vegetative cells of Dictyostelium discoideum were incubated in nutrient
      medium containing 5 mM caffeine, adenylate cyclase was induced and exceeded
      control values 30-fold after 6 h of incubation. The effect was dose-dependent and
      blocked by cycloheximide. Contact site A, a developmentally regulated membrane
      glycoprotein characteristic of aggregation-competent cells, was not induced by
      the treatment. The expression of a developmentally regulated gene coding for an
      unknown protein and hybridizing with the cDNA clone P26E8 was also stimulated,
      indicating that the regulation of expression occurs at the transcript level.
      Cells pretreated with caffeine in growth medium, washed and developed in
      starvation buffer showed an acceleration of development by 2 h as judged by
      stream formation and the appearance of contact sites A. The same effects were
      observed when cells were incubated under heat shock conditions (30 degrees C).
      The results indicate that caffeine stimulates the expression of devevelopmentally
      regulated early genes, and that their products, together with exogeneous
      factor(s), initiate subsequent steps of development.

TI  - The virulent satellite RNA of turnip crinkle virus has a major domain homologous 
      to the 3' end of the helper virus genome.
PG  - 3423-8
AB  - RNA C (355 bases), RNA D (194 bases) and RNA F (230 bases) are small, linear
      satellite RNAs of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) which have been cloned as cDNAs and 
      sequenced in this study. These RNAs produce dramatically different disease
      symptoms in infected plants. RNA C is a virulent satellite that intensifies virus
      symptoms when co-inoculated with its helper virus in turnip plants, while RNA D
      and RNA F are avirulent. RNA D and RNA F, the avirulent satellites, are closely
      related to each other except that RNA F has a 36-base insert near its 3' end, not
      found in RNA D. The 189 bases at the 5' end of RNA C, the virulent satellite, are
      homologous to the entire sequence of RNA D. However, the 3' half of RNA C, is
      composed of 166 bases which are nearly identical to two regions at the 3' end of 
      the TCV helper virus genome. Hence, the virulent satellite is a composite
      molecule with one domain at its 5' end homologous to the other avirulent
      satellites and another domain at its 3' end homologous to the helper virus
      genome. All four TCV RNAs, RNAs C, D and F and the helper virus genome have
      identical 7 bases at their 3' ends. The secondary structure of RNA C deduced from
      the sequence can be folded into two separate domains - the domain of helper virus
      genome homology and the domain homologous to other TCV satellite RNAs.
      Comparative sequences of several different RNA C clones reveal that this
      satellite is a population of molecules with sequence and length heterogeneity.

PG  - 3417-22
AB  - Transcripts of three distinct ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPC) small
      subunit (SS) genes account for approximately 90% of the mRNA for this protein in 
      maize leaves. Transcripts of two of them constitute >80% of the SS mRNA in 24-h
      greening maize leaves. The third gene contribute approximately 10%. Transcripts
      of all three nuclear-encoded SS genes are detectable in bundle sheath (BSC) and
      mesophyll cells (MC) of etiolated maize leaves. The level of mRNA for each gene
      is different in etioplasts of MC but all drop during photoregulated development
      of chloroplasts in MC and follow a pattern of transitory rise and fall in BSC.
      The amounts of LS and SS proteins continue to increase steadily well after the
      mRNA levels reach their peaks in BSC. The molar ratio of mRNA for
      chloroplast-encoded RuBPC large subunit (LS) to the nuclear genome encoded SS is 
      about 10:1 although LS and SS proteins are present in about equimolar amounts.

PG  - 3409-15
AB  - The three-dimensional structure of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
      carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) from Rhodospirillum rubrum has been determined at
      2.9 A resolution by X-ray crystallographic methods. The MIR-electron density map 
      was substantially improved by two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging.
      The polypeptide chains in the dimer were traced using a graphics display system
      with the help of the BONES option in FRODO. The dimer has approximate dimensions 
      of 50 x 72 x 105 A. The enzyme subunit is a typical two-domain protein. The
      smaller, N-terminal domain consists of 137 amino acid residues and forms a
      central, mixed five-stranded beta-sheet with alpha-helices on both sides of the
      sheet. The larger C-terminal domain consists of 329 amino acid residues. This
      domain has an eight-stranded parallel alpha/beta barrel structure as found in
      triosephosphate isomerase and a number of other functionally non-related
      proteins. The active site in Rubisco determined by difference Fourier techniques 
      and fitting of active site residues to the electron density map, is located at
      the carboxy-end of the beta-strands in the alpha/beta barrel of the C-terminal
      domain. There are few domain-domain interactions within the subunit. The
      interactions at the interface between the two subunits of the dimer are tight and
      extensive. There are tight contacts between the two C-terminal domains, which
      build up the core of the molecule. There are also interactions between the
      N-terminal domain of one subunit and the C-terminal domain of the second subunit,
      close to the active site.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the yellow locus of Drosophila.
PG  - 3597-605
AB  - The yellow (y) locus of Drosophila controls the pattern of pigmentation of the
      adult cuticle and larval mouth parts. Mutations of y belong to two phenotypic
      classes; type1 mutants exhibit a total loss of pigmentation from all parts of the
      cuticle and type 2 mutants show allele-specific mosaic pigmentation patterns. We 
      have cloned y by P-element tagging followed by chromosome walking. We demonstrate
      that a 2.1-kb transcript which spans 4.6 kb of genomic sequence is the y
      transcript. The location of this transcript and the putative protein it encodes
      has been defined by nuclease protection, primer extension and DNA sequencing
      experiments. A 12-kb genomic fragment containing this transcript along with 2.8
      kb of 5'-flanking sequence and 4.6 kb of 3'-flanking sequence is sufficient for
      the wild-type expression of the larval and adult cuticle phenotypes in germ-line 
      transformants. The majority (12/14) of type1 mutants show structural lesions
      within exon coding portions of y. Most (6/7) of the type2 structural lesions map 
      5' to the start of y transcription. One type2 mutant which contains an insertion 
      within the 5'-transcribed but non-translated region appears to have resulted from
      the internal deletion of a P-element associated with a type1 allele.

TI  - Homology between the ran1+ gene of fission yeast and protein kinases.
PG  - 3665-71
AB  - The ran1+ gene of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a negative
      regulator of both sexual conjugation and meiosis. The nucleotide sequence of the 
      gene has been determined and contains a region of open reading frame (ORF)
      capable of encoding a protein of 52,000 daltons. S1 nuclease analysis of
      ran1+-encoded RNA showed that the ORF was spanned by an uninterrupted transcript.
      A fragment of DNA containing the entire ran1+ gene was expressed in a bacterial
      expression vector and found to encode the expected product of 52,000 daltons. The
      putative ran1+ gene product shares significant sequence homology with known
      protein kinases. The level of the ran1+ transcript was similar in vegetative and 
      meiotic cells suggesting that the ran1+ protein product rather than its
      transcript is regulated during sexual differentiation.

TI  - Trypanosome hybrids generated in tsetse flies by nuclear fusion.
PG  - 3631-6
AB  - Genetic exchange may occur between two particular Trypanosoma brucei clones
      simultaneously transmitted by the same tsetse fly. We report here that this
      exchange takes place in the fly, through nuclear fusion. The resulting hybrids
      appear to be sub-tetraploid, some particular DNA sequences from one of the
      parental stocks being lost before enough cloned hybrid trypanosomes could be
      harvested for DNA analysis. A further reduction of the DNA content of these
      hybrids occurs gradually upon growth and yields near diploid value in a major
      part of the population. This mode of hybrid generation is different from the
      fusion of haploid gametes, which is thought to occur normally upon inoculation of
      metacyclic trypanosomes in their mammalian host. In this respect, the
      sub-tetraploid hybrids appear to undergo meiosis in the fly, generating
      sub-diploid metacyclic forms, then fusion in the mammalian blood.

TI  - Phylogenetic evidence for the acquisition of ribosomal RNA introns subsequent to 
      the divergence of some of the major Tetrahymena groups.
PG  - 3625-30
AB  - Previous work has demonstrated the presence of a self-splicing intron in the
      large subunit ribosomal RNA coding region in some strains of the ciliate
      protozoan Tetrahymena. Sequence comparisons of the intron regions from six
      Tetrahymena species showed these to fall into three homology groups. In an
      attempt to evaluate the evolutionary origins of the intervening sequences, we
      have now determined complete small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences from 13
      species of Tetrahymena and the absolute number of nucleotide differences between 
      the sequences was used to construct a phylogenetic tree. This phylogeny was
      consistent with the groupings suggested by comparisons of other biochemical
      characters including cytoskeletal proteins, isozyme analyses, and restriction
      maps of complete rRNA transcription units. The homology groupings that were based
      upon the intron sequence data do not agree with the relationships inferred from
      the small subunit rRNA sequence data. These observations are taken to indicate
      that the intron character has been acquired independently in different species at
      a stage later than the branching out of the species.

PG  - 1384-99
AB  - Recent studies revealed that anti-TSH receptor autoantibodies are involved in the
      pathogenesis of both Graves' disease and a part of hypothyroidism, but precise
      mechanism of action of these antibodies remained to be studied. In order to
      delineate the heterogeneity of these antibodies and their pathophysiological
      significance, we produced monoclonal antibodies to TSH receptor and studied their
      characteristics. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to TSH receptor were derived from
      spleen cells of mice immunized with partially purified human TSH receptor, which 
      was prepared by TSH-coupled affinity chromatography of thyroid membrane
      solubilized with Triton X-100. By fusing spleen cells and mouse myeloma cells in 
      the presence of polyethylene glycol and selecting with limiting dilution method, 
      5 hybridomas were obtained. Among 3 antibodies, which inhibited TSH binding to
      thyroid membrane (TSH displacing activity, TDA), 2 inhibited TSH stimulation of
      thyroid adenylate cyclase (AC) (human thyroid adenylate cyclase inhibitor
      activity, HTACI), and one showed no bioactivity. Among other 2 antibodies without
      TDA, 1 stimulated AC (human thyroid adenylate cyclase stimulator activity, HTACS)
      and the other inhibited TSH stimulation (HTACI). All activities of these
      antibodies were dependent on IgG concentration and disappeared by treatment of
      anti-mouse IgG antibodies. In addition, 4 human-human hybridomas were established
      by fusing human peripheral lymphocytes of patients with Graves' disease and
      nongoitrous hypothyroidism with human lymphoblastoid cell line. Among 2
      antibodies with TDA, one antibody inhibited TSH stimulation of AC, inhibiting TSH
      binding competitively and another antibody stimulated AC, inhibiting TSH binding 
      noncompetitively. Among the other 2 antibodies, which did not inhibit TSH binding
      but were shown to bind to TSH receptor by immunoprecipitation, one stimulated AC 
      and the other inhibited TSH stimulation of AC. Among 2 antibodies with HTACI, one
      antibody with positive TDA inhibited stimulation of AC by stimulative antibodies 
      with positive TDA, but the other without TDA inhibited stimulation of AC by both 
      antibodies with or without positive TDA. These inhibitory antibodies did not
      inhibit stimulation of AC by Forskolin and Gpp(NH)p, which are known to affect
      other parts of receptor-AC system than receptor unit. These data suggest that
      anti-TSH receptor antibodies are heterogenous in the mode of binding to the
      receptor and in their bioactivities, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of
      both Graves' disease and a part of idiopathic hypothyroidism.

      and phorbol ester on DNA synthesis in cultured porcine thyroid cells].
PG  - 1362-75
AB  - Using porcine thyroid cells of primary monolayer culture, this study was
      conducted to clarify the nature and characteristics of epidermal growth factor
      (EGF) receptors on porcine thyroid cells and also to investigate the effects of
      EGF, TSH and phorbol ester on DNA synthesis. Receptors for EGF on porcine thyroid
      cells exist in two forms which differ in both affinity and capacity. Scatchard
      analysis of saturation binding assay performed at 4 degrees C for 6h indicates
      that there is a high affinity class of receptors with low capacity (K1 = 4.70 +/-
      0.90 X 10(-9)M and 8,600 +/- 1,200 sites/cell) and low affinity receptors with
      high capacity (K2 = 2.24 +/- 1.17 X 10(-7)M and 65,500 +/- 18,000 sites/cell) on 
      the cells cultured for 4 days in the absence of TSH. When thyroid cells were
      cultured in the presence of various concentrations of TSH (0 approximately 50
      mU/ml) and for various times (0 approximately 96 h) with TSH (10 mU/ml), specific
      EGF binding to the cells increased dose- and time-dependently. On TSH (10
      mU/ml)-treated cells for 4 days, two kinds of EGF receptors, i.e. high affinity
      and low capacity (K1 = 5.39 +/- 1.75 X 10(-9) M and 17,200 +/- 2,500 sites/cell) 
      and low affinity and high capacity (K2 = 1.70 +/- 1.40 X 10(-7)M and 76,300 +/-
      17,900 sites/cells), were resolved. The results indicate that TSH can modulate
      EGF receptors by increasing the number of high affinity sites on porcine thyroid 
      cells. Next, using [Me-3H] thymidine incorporation into TCA precipitable
      materials for 48h, we studied the biological effects of EGF, TSH and phorbol
      myristate acetate (one of the potent phorbol esters) on DNA synthesis. Both EGF
      and PMA can promote [Me-3H] thymidine incorporation. Maximal responses were
      obtained with EGF ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-7)M and with PMA from 10(-9) to
      10(-7)M. In contrast, TSH inhibits [Me-3H] thymidine incorporation
      dose-dependently. Almost the same results were obtained by these agents on TSH
      (10 mU/ml)-treated cells for 4 days, but EGF stimulated cell growth at a lower
      concentration of 10(-11)M, which was possibly related to an increase of high
      affinity receptor numbers. The growth promoting effect of EGF and PMA in
      combination was additive, and TSH suppressed the cell growth in the concomitant
      presence of EGF and PMA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - [Selective augmentation of cellular hCG alpha mRNA levels and immunoreactive hCG 
      alpha secretion by 17 beta-estradiol in the normal placenta].
PG  - 1352-61
AB  - In order to elucidate a possible self-regulation for hCG synthesis in placenta,
      effects of estradiol on hCG production and secretion were evaluated by culturing 
      early placental tissue in the presence or absence of estradiol. The cellular
      level of mRNAs encoding hCG (alpha, beta) and hPL were estimated by mean grain
      count per syncytial nucleus on the placental sections hybridized in situ with
      labeled cDNA probes corresponding to these mRNAs. Immunoreactive hCG, hCG alpha
      and hPL in the media and explanted tissues were measured by the homologous RIAs. 
      Addition of estradiol at concentration of 1 approximately 10 ng/ml into the
      medium caused an increase in the cellular levels of hCG alpha mRNA after 24-hour 
      cultured, and exhibited significant increases in immunoreactive hCG alpha levels 
      in the media and explanted tissues after 72-hour culture. The addition of
      estradiol neither affected the cellular levels of mRNA encoding hCG beta and hPL 
      nor immunoreactive hCG and hPL levels in the media and tissues. The appropriated 
      concentration of estradiol (1 approximately 10 ng/ml) used in above experiments
      was found to be similar to the tissue concentration in normal placenta. These
      findings suggest that the physiological concentration of estradiol selectively
      stimulates hCG alpha synthesis and secretion by normal placenta. Thus, estradiol 
      in placenta may be a factor responsible for the increase of hCG alpha in maternal
      serum and placental tissue with the progress of gestation.

TI  - [Histological changes and operative findings of pituitary adenomas after
      bromocriptine treatment].
PG  - 1336-51
AB  - Twenty-eight patients with various types of pituitary adenomas were studied
      endocrinologically and neuroradiologically. We observed the changes of tumor size
      during bromocriptine treatment. After various periods of bromocriptine therapy,
      we operated on these tumors and examined then histologically. One of 5 patients
      with nonfunctioning adenomas improved remarkably in his visual field and acuity
      after 7-month bromocriptine therapy. The pathological findings disclosed
      remarkable changes in tumors composed of shrunken island-like cell nests and
      acellular spaces. These shrunken island-like cell nests were composed of tumor
      cells whose cytoplasmic volume decreased and whose nuclear chromatin clumped. In 
      acellular spaces, there were irreversibly destructed tumor cells, hyaline
      substances, tumor cell debris and collagen fibrils. One of 8 cases of
      acromegalies showed a remarkably reduced tumor on CT with clinical improvement
      after treatment with bromocriptine for 10 months. This patient's serum growth
      hormone titer was raised by an abnormal response to intravenously injected TRH
      (thyrotropin releasing hormone), and his serum prolactin was abnormally high.
      Therefore, this tumor was thought to be a mixed adenoma with growth hormone
      secreting and/or prolactin secreting cells. Histological examinations disclosed
      cell shrinkage of tumor cells. Interestingly, there were scanty fibrotic changes 
      in this tumor in spite of the long term bromocriptine therapy. In 15 cases of
      prolactinomas, the larger the tumor size and the longer the period of the
      bromocriptine therapy, the more fibrosis was seen. Under a period of
      bromocriptine therapy longer than 3 months, the fibrotic changes of tumor
      progressed, and this made more difficulty in selective adenomectomy even in the
      case of intrasellar adenomas. Therefore we thought that transsphenoidal surgery
      could successfully be done within 3 months during continuation of bromocriptine
      therapy.

TI  - [A reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography-UV spectrometry method
      for the analysis of several intrinsic adrenal delta 4-steroid concentrations].
PG  - 1326-35
AB  - Taking an advantage of the property of delta 4-steroid that have a maximum
      absorbance around 250 nm wave-length of ultraviolet, we devised an assay method
      for the determination of serum delta 4-steroids concentration using a reverse
      phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV spectrometry. The assay
      procedure was as follows: A mixed solvent containing methanol, acetonitrile and
      water in 55/3/42 by volume was used as a mobile phase, and which was pumped at a 
      constant flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The main column and precolumn used were
      ERC-ODS-1161 (phi 6 mm X 10 cm) and ERC-ODS-1652 (phi 6mm X 3 cm), respectively. 
      Two liquid-liquid extraction methods were used. One was a conventional method
      using dichloromethane for an extraction solvent, and the other was a simplified
      method using Extrelut column and ethyl acetate. Before a practical assay we
      examined the retention time of each steroid determined and its ratio of peak
      height to that of the internal standard (dexamethasone). We found good
      correlations between the concentrations of cortisol (F), 17
      alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and 21-deoxycortisol (21-DOF) estimated by
      this HPLC method and those by highly specific radioimmunoassay method. The
      concentrations of cortisone (E) and F of eight umbilical venous blood specimens
      were 159.7 +/- 26.3 (Mean +/- SD) ng/ml and 93.3 +/- 58.9 ng/ml, respectively,
      and 17-OHP was detected 7 of them and its concentration was 17.4 +/- 12.4 ng/ml. 
      On the other hand, 17-OHP and 21-DOF peaks could not be detected in 1 month old
      normal infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - An investigation into the aetiology of 'wool slip': alopecia in ewes which are
      housed and shorn in winter.
PG  - 621-5
AB  - Alopecia in housed ewes which are shorn in winter, 'wool slip', was investigated 
      by taking wool and blood samples, skin scrapings and biopsies from affected and
      unaffected animals. Epidemiological information was also obtained from farm
      records, and reports from a local weather station. No pathological lesions were
      seen and no ectoparasites or forage mites were seen in wool samples or skin
      scrapings. The plasma zinc and copper concentrations of both groups were within
      the normal range but the copper concentrations were significantly lower in the
      unaffected animals. There was no difference between the prevalence of the disease
      in ewes of different breeds or between those producing single or twin lambs. A
      comparison of the mean temperatures during years of summer and winter shearing
      suggested that cold stress alone was not involved. Skin biopsies revealed that
      the wool follicles of affected animals were in an early growth phase (anagen)
      whereas those of unaffected animals were in the inactive phase (telogen). The
      clinical and histological signs of the disease were similar to those seen
      experimentally when corticosteroids are used as chemical depilatory agents. It is
      suggested that wool slip is due to the high levels of corticosteroids which occur
      as a result of the combination of housing and shearing and on this basis methods 
      of control are proposed.

TI  - Halothane anaesthesia in the dromedary camel.
PG  - 615-7
AB  - It was shown that the effects of halothane anaesthesia in the dromedary are
      similar to those of large domestic ruminants. As a general rule the equipment and
      techniques used for adult cattle may also be used in the dromedary. Endotracheal 
      intubation may be more difficult in camels because of their narrow oral cavities.
      Involuntary regurgitation is a particular hazard in dromedaries and every effort 
      should be made to avoid this potentially life threatening complication.

      heparin-ergotamine: coronary artery spasm the cause?].
PG  - 1814-6
AB  - There have been several recent publications reporting vasospastic complications
      under heparin-dihydroergotamine prophylaxis. We report on 2 patients without
      significant coronary artery stenosis who died of acute myocardial infarction.
      Both patients had been operated on for a lumbar disc protrusion and were treated 
      with 2500 IU heparin + 0.5 mg dihydroergotamine s.c. twice daily. The possibility
      of coronary arterial spasm as the cause of the myocardial infarctions is
      discussed. Publications reporting cases with myocardial infarctions, presumably
      caused by coronary arterial spasm, and other vasospastic complications under
      ergotamine therapy are briefly reviewed.

TI  - [Allergic angioedema after local dental anesthesia and a hyaluronidase-containing
      preanesthetic injection solution].
PG  - 1810-3
AB  - Two patients are described who developed allergic angioedema following local
      anesthesia for dental surgery. Skin testing revealed that hyaluronidase from bull
      testes contained in one of the preparations used for local anesthesia was the
      responsible allergen. In both patients hyaluronidase-specific serum IgE
      antibodies were detected by RAST. Mammalian hyaluronidase, also called spreading 
      factor, is believed to improve penetration of tissues by local anesthetics. It is
      used worldwide for this and other indications. In the presence of allergic
      reactions to local anesthetics the possibility of sensitization to hyaluronidase 
      should be considered.

PG  - 838-9
AB  - Because of a pancytopenia, moderately cellular bone marrow with hypoplastic
      erythropoiesis but with active granulo- and thrombopoiesis and a conspicuous
      increase in histiocytic cells, a patient was provisionally diagnosed as having
      histiocytic medullary reticulosis. However, Salmonella typhi was cultured from
      blood, urine and stool specimens. After 3 weeks the Widal reaction showed a titre
      of 1/320 for the H-antigen and 1/1,280 for the O-antigen. The patient was treated
      with chloramphenicol for 10 days and the fever, enlarged spleen and enlarged
      lymph nodes returned to normal.

PG  - 832-7
AB  - Death directly related to selective coronary arteriography in 5 patients with a
      history of unstable angina pectoris during the period 1975-1985 is reported. Four
      different cardiologists were involved. A feature common to all the cases was the 
      presence of significant ostial stenosis of the left mainstem coronary artery
      (LMCA); 2 patients had haemodynamically important obstruction of a dominant right
      coronary artery (RCA) ostium, while 2 others had total occlusion in the proximal 
      part of a dominant RCA. The RCA in the last case was angiographically normal and 
      non-dominant. Collateral coronary blood flow was fairly sparse in most cases and 
      in 4 left ventricular dysfunction of varying degree was present. All patients
      developed severe hypotension and electromechanical dissociation after
      arteriography while still in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
      Resuscitation efforts were uniformly unsuccessful. Autopsy on 1 patient
      demonstrated extensive obstructive coronary atherosclerosis with a massive acute 
      anterior myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization poses an extremely high
      risk for this subgroup of patients with LMCA disease, as does selective coronary 
      arteriography. The possible role of catheter-provoked coronary vasospasm of the
      LMCA is suggested; a recently introduced soft-tipped cardiovascular catheter may 
      be more appropriate in this setting.

AB  - All births and perinatal deaths from Mitchell's Plain, Cape Town, during the
      first 8 months of 1985 were analysed. Out of a total of 4,228 liveborn infants
      66.4% were delivered by the Peninsula Maternity and Neonatal Service (PMNS),
      while the remaining 33.6% were born to private patients. There was an overall
      preterm rate of 11.0%, while 13.8% of infants had a birth weight of less than
      2,500 g. Only 16.1% of mothers booked early. The perinatal mortality rate was
      22.2/1,000 and the stillbirth rate 12.6/1,000. The stillbirth rate for private
      patients was more than 6 times lower than that for their PMNS counterparts (2.8
      v. 17.5/1,000).

      families.
PG  - 819-22
AB  - Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) activity was determined in 7 families with
      porphyria variegata (PV). Enzyme activity was reduced by 50% in 8 propositi and
      in 8 out of 16 prepubertal children. These results are in keeping with the
      concept that PV is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease. Enzyme activity
      was also reduced in the fathers of 2 of the propositi, who were suspected on
      family history of carrying the PV trait, but who had no clinical manifestations. 
      Determination of PPO activity provides a reliable means of identifying PV and of 
      identifying offspring who could, at puberty, become PV patients.

TI  - Laboratory studies of the 1984 influenza epidemic on the Witwatersrand.
PG  - 815-8
AB  - A particularly severe outbreak of influenza occurred on the Witwatersrand from
      May to August 1984, caused sequentially by influenza A (H3N2), B/influenza and
      influenza A (H1N1) viruses. Although the precise extent of the infection was
      impossible to determine, valuable anecdotal information was provided by a network
      of sentinel sampling stations in private practices, clinics and hospitals,
      representing a cross-section of population groups on the Witwatersrand. This
      active surveillance programme was invaluable in providing some 85% of all the
      specimens, the remainder being routine clinical specimens; in addition, isolation
      was approximately twice as efficient for the actively acquired specimens than for
      the routine ones. The epidemic affected all individuals approximately equally,
      regardless of age, race or socio-economic status. Infection with H1N1 virus
      tended to predominate in the younger age group, 78% of isolates being from
      subjects under 30 years of age, whereas 71% of H3N2 isolates came from subjects
      over 30 years of age. The B/influenza isolates tended to be more evenly
      dispersed. Novel strains of B/influenza and H1N1 viruses were introduced into the
      country and possibly contributed to the greater than usual severity of the
      epidemic. An active surveillance programme is essential to monitor the extent of 
      influenza virus activity and to alert virologists to the introduction of new
      strains, although at present forecasting of future influenza epidemics is not
      possible with any significant degree of reliability.

TI  - Buerger's disease or Buerger's syndrome? An analysis of 12 cases.
PG  - 803-5
AB  - Controversy continues over the clinical concept of Buerger's disease. Although
      clinical and radiological criteria exist to prove the diagnosis and most
      clinicians acknowledge this disease, there is the question of possible cases of
      Buerger's disease where the criteria cannot be met. Should these cases be
      referred to as Buerger's syndrome? In order to elucidate this question, we
      analysed 12 recent cases (1% of all our cases of vascular disease). In 6 cases
      (50%) the clinical and diagnostic criteria of Buerger's disease were met fully;
      in 4 (32%) the clinical picture favoured Buerger's syndrome; in another 2
      patients the clinical picture was that of Buerger's syndrome but the arteriograms
      showed signs of atheroma. Eight of the 12 patients underwent sympathectomy. One
      patient, considered to have visceral and cerebral involvement, died.

TI  - Advantages of the new low-osmolar radiographic contrast media.
PG  - 796-8
AB  - Intravascular contrast media are important in the radiological diagnostic
      process. Their use is associated with significant side-effects, but new
      low-osmolar contrast agents have been developed in an attempt to decrease the
      severity and incidence of these. The molecular structure of contrast media and
      their relationship to side-effects is discussed. The advantages of, indications
      for and contraindications to the new low-osmolar contrast media are presented.

TI  - Late potentials, ventricular stimulation and ventricular tachycardia.
PG  - 793-6
AB  - Late potentials are depolarizations which arise from areas of delayed ventricular
      activation and may indicate a propensity for ventricular tachycardia. Sixty-four 
      subjects were assessed by non-invasive measurement. Late potentials were not
      present in 20 subjects with normal hearts nor in 6 patients with cardiac disease 
      but with no evidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Seventeen of 20 patients
      with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (RSVT) and 2 of 10 patients with
      unsustained VT had late potentials. None of the 6 patients with automatic VT or
      the 2 patients with torsades de pointe had late potentials. In a subgroup of 28
      symptomatic patients in whom programmed ventricular stimulation was performed,
      late potentials correlated with inducibility of sustained VT (P less than 0.05). 
      Late potentials may therefore serve as a useful marker of RSVT and confirm a
      re-entrant mechanism of VT.

TI  - Amino acid sequence data of alpha-tubulin from myxamoebae of Physarum
      polycephalum.
PG  - 919-24
AB  - About 96% of the amino acid sequence of an alpha-tubulin from the slime mould
      Physarum polycephalum has been determined. Of 430 sequenced amino acids, 30
      differ from the deduced amino acid sequence of a recently published alpha-tubulin
      complementary DNA from the plasmodial form of P. polycephalum. The myxamoebal
      alpha-tubulin differs from all other known alpha-tubulins in one of the last
      three C-terminal amino acids that are Gly-Glu-Tyr instead of the usual
      Glu-Glu-Tyr. These last three amino acids are preceded by 11 residues that appear
      to be particularly susceptible to mutation. No heterogeneity was found whilst
      sequencing the myxamoebal alpha-tubulin, indicating that only one type of
      alpha-tubulin is present in myxamoebae. This alpha-tubulin appears to be less
      conserved than the previously described plasmodial alpha-tubulin, supporting the 
      hypothesis that the structural constraints on tubulin in axonemes have a
      significant effect on its rate of mutation.

TI  - Principles of sequence-dependent flexure of DNA.
PG  - 907-18
AB  - The curvature of a bent rod may be defined in several different, but equivalent
      ways. The best way of describing the curvature of double-helical DNA is by an
      angle of turning per base step. Curvature comes mainly from the angle of roll
      between successive base-pairs, and this is defined as positive when the angle
      opens up on the minor groove side of the bases. DNA forms a plane curve if the
      roll angle values along the molecule alternate periodically between positive and 
      negative, with a complete period equal to the helical repeat. It is known from
      studies of crystallized oligomers that the roll angles for particular
      dinucleotide steps have preferred values, or lie in preferred ranges of values.
      Therefore the formation of a plane curve will be easier with some base sequences 
      of DNA than with others. We set up a computer algorithm for determining the ease 
      with which DNA of given sequence will adopt a curved form. The algorithm has two 
      different sets of constants: in model 1 the base step parameters come from an
      inspection of crystallized oligomers, and in model 2 data from a statistical
      survey of the incidence of dinucleotide steps in a large number of samples of
      chicken erythrocyte core DNA is incorporated. Both forms of the algorithm
      successfully locate the dyad of the nucleosome sequence (modulo 10) in a frog
      gene, and suggest strongly that sequence-dependent flexural properties of DNA
      play a part in the recognition of binding sites by nucleosome cores.

TI  - Three-dimensional reconstruction of the connector of bacteriophage phi 29 at 1.8 
      nm resolution.
PG  - 853-67
AB  - The three-dimensional reconstruction of the connector of bacteriophage phi 29 has
      been obtained from tilt series of negatively stained tetragonal ordered
      aggregates under low-dose conditions and up to a resolution of (1/1.8) nm-1.
      These connectors are built up as dodecamers of only one structural polypeptide
      (p10). Two connectors form the crystal unit cell, each one facing in the opposite
      direction with respect to the plane of the crystal and partially overlapping. The
      main features of the two connectors that build the unit cell were essentially the
      same, although they were negatively stained in slightly different ways, probably 
      due to their situations with respect to the carbon-coated support grid. The main 
      features of the phi 29 connector structure revealed by this three-dimensional
      reconstruction are: the existence of two clearly defined domains, one with a
      diameter of around 14 nm and the other narrower (diameter approximately equal to 
      7.5 nm); an inner hole running all along the structure (around 7 to 8 nm in
      height) with a cylindrical profile and an average diameter of 4 nm; a general
      6-fold symmetry along the whole structure and a 12-fold one in the wider domain; 
      a clockwise twist of the more contrasted regions of both domains from the
      narrower towards the wider domain (the direction of DNA encapsidation). These
      features are compatible with an active role for the connector in the process of
      DNA packaging.

TI  - Calf lens alpha-crystallin quaternary structure. A three-layer tetrahedral model.
PG  - 711-24
AB  - Calf lens alpha-crystallins are polydisperse globular particles made of a large
      number of two types of subunits, A and B, both of molecular weight congruent to
      20,000. alpha-Crystallin populations consisting on average of 40 subunits or more
      were subjected to various changes in pH, ionic strength, temperature and urea
      concentration. Modifications in quaternary structure induced by variation of
      these physicochemical parameters were followed by means of X-ray and
      quasi-elastic light-scattering and quantified in terms of weight average
      molecular weight (M), radius of gyration (Rg) and hydrodynamic radius (Rh).
      High-pressure liquid chromatography was used as a control of polydispersity.
      Increasing the pH, decreasing the ionic strength and incubating at temperatures
      from 20 degrees C to 45 degrees C all resulted in the formation of particles of
      decreasing M, Rg and Rh values. These effects are cumulative. All monomodal
      alpha-crystallin populations encountered in this study, which covers a wide range
      of sizes and molecular weights, may be accounted for by a three-layer model with 
      partial filling up of the layers. Applying basic principles of symmetry and
      postulating specific contacts between protein subunits to construct this
      three-layer model leads to tetrahedral symmetry, with 12, 24 and 24 sites in the 
      first, second and third layers, respectively. Variations in probabilities of site
      occupancy account for both the observed quaternary structure modifications and
      the intrinsic polydispersity of alpha-crystallins
